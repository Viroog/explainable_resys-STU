can absolutely recommend this . 
atrium view with great artwork and flowers is worth the visit 
on the rooftop an open sky swimming pool - fun 
the rooms are spacious and the bathroom has a large tub 
this is one of the better hotels in the area 
the hotel is directly opposite budapest 's famous chain bridge and the danube 
many of the w hotels in this global franchise lack the sheer class of this property and or the staff 
our room which had a balcony overlooking the castle district and the chain bridge was also just what we expected 
as i was stuck outside the entrance because there was some hip party happening and they could n't quite 
elevated seperate bedroom 
the only reason i did not give it a poor rating was that the staff at every contact point we 
the concierge desk was extremely helpful and definitely gave us great advice as to where to go for 
beautiful lobby and nice bar 
i met with the operations manager on one of my past trips and he assured me everything would be corrected 
the gym is okay and pool and hot tub are great 
as i walk outside to leave-- already irritated --- i see no valets 
staff experience was mixed even with concierge with a great experience for getting a cab to town offset 
we were on a floor close to the club lounge so we had 'free' internet ( 2 m 
next to the ritz carlton too which as a great rooftop bar 
the beds were super comfortable 
our spectacular room 3213 had a spectacular view of the harbour and the giant ici tower where the 
great hotel in great location 
a nice bar and is conveniently located 
n nso back to the review - you must stay here and go to bali 
superb service 
the afternoon tea was a fantastic way to enjoy the ubud hospitality and our kids loved lounging 
rooms are spacious ( even the cheaper ones ) and nicely furbished 
the limousine to airport is very efficient and nicky the staff member at the airport makes sure 
you can check your bags at the train station 
komaneka has a car transfer between the centre and other komanekas in ubud area 
my buffet lunch in the dining room on day of departure was deliciously yet another superlative -- 
aesthetically this is one of the best hotels i have seen 
maps and pre-loaded social media apps like instagram and facebook 
contents of minibar are free and replenished daily 
the long pool 
lots of free snacks and drinks 
the pool is amazing 
one other minor issue was the lobby bar only had about two of the 10 beers on the menu actually 
taking the airport express train ) 
the complementary snacks and minibar are a standout and the location ca n't be beaten for easy 
it costs much to stay in sydney avoid this one . 
breakfast was a bit pricey but very good 
maybe they got the wrong room 
and given the price it charges customers and the brands popularity 
the general manager was in the lobby each morning chatting to guests and the team very helpful 
rooms decorated in typical w style although compared to w 's i have visited in miami 
swimming pool on 76 floor has an amazing view 
spacious bath and luggage areas 
good size 
i love the open concept bathroom and the bliss toiletries 
we had a look at some of the restaurants and bars and they all have luxury and interesting designs although 
i stayed here last year for the last night of a three night stay in beijing 
landed really early from uk flight 
we experienced problem with strange smell in the bathroom at first 
ritz carlton across the street is better 
there is a lot of useful workspace and the main control panel in the sitting room was beside the work 
room was fairly modern with all the necessary facilities 
so in all ways this is a very good city hotel 
he came by again and asked if he could borrow my passport so that he could check if a room 
the lobby restaurant is good with diverse options albeit at a high cost 
as mr plat got upgraded room ( 1 level up ) and free breakfast and lounge 
why wooden floors i do n't know 
we got a nice price for the weekend and i thought it was good value for money 
lots of interesting touches 
there are counters at the kowloon station for you to check in your luggage so you do not 
- no mini-bar in room- large numbers of tourist buses arriving en-mass and clogging 
- view - facing 2 big blocks of apartments 
had lots of vegetarian options on the menu and everything 
it is located right off the main shopping street and close to everything 
pretty nice pricey hotel with good trade center inside 
the lobby is clean spacious and welcoming 
spacious hotel 
so that there is a direct connection to the public transportation 
love the little touches 
i was given one of the best welcomes to a hotel i 've received and the porter that 
just two blocks- a very easy walk from the hauptbanhoff train station and the cathedral 
i have stayed here several times since it opened and never been disappointed 
big and quite modern gym 
was in town for a few days for work and decided to pick this new location over where i usually 
the roof top wet bar is a must see 
the staff is helpful 
super hotel with options for all the family 
the beach located suite with ocean view lived up to all our expectations - large bed 
the place just makes up whatever has to to make the trip and experience memorable 
because of the shopping centre next door 
great showers and lots of plugs for all my electronics 
i wish to have renovated suite for next visit 
staff in bliss staff was ultra friendly and happy and the reception was very helpful and patient 
plenty of dining and nightlife options available nearby 
email and call ahead & have the hotel porter assist in arrival and departure once you reached here through 
breakfast buffet was very good 
other than the attached mall there is really no where to walk 
there are plenty of nice hotels in shenzhen 
would return at the right price 
room was smallish but practical - very small bathroom 
room quality good 
the staff can mix drinks for you and the food is quite delicious - in fact it almost suffic 
the temperature is just right so even on a very windy day it felt great to dive in for 
convenient lounge 
good for short stay 
rooftop pool very good with nice views over singapore 
but could even use the shower and the sauna 
the buffet dinner and breakfast were top notch and filled with tons of western and chinese choices 
yes a very good hotel 
public areas 
the lounge opens till midnight for soda 
the rooms are very comfortable and the location near the duomo ca n't be beat 
perfectly located and we will return during our next visit to milam 
while the prices are not bad 
close to the train station and major shopping streets but does n't seem to suffer too much from noise 
which again is very cool and a great area to chill out after a long day shopping sight seeing 
well located with comfortable if not luxury accomodation at a reasonable price 
the breakfast buffet was complete with bread 
worst was we received a call from front desk this morning 
i always feel welcome when i stay here 
the decor is pleasant if slightly tired 
there are also these cute panels outside of each room that designates do not disturb or please make up 
the windows opened wide and welcomed in milan 
but what 's lacking in the size of the rooms you get back in comfort 
clever use of space with the relatively small bathroom wetroom feeling deceptively large 
the hotel did provide some great umbrellas ( and they were plentiful ) that made the rain a 
do n't miss the bottled fresh juices and especially the chocolate milk 
located at the elements mall so access to many good restaurants - not necessarily 'fine dining' but 
impressive entrance 
the gym is not good enough for serious workouts 
all the personnel wwas very nice and collaborative 
and maybe it was a weekday , woobar was pretty quiet but still the w vibe is there 
choose higher floor 
great bathroom 
the bed was very comfortable and it provided a good nights sleep 
you can actually take the shuttle bus to ferry terminal and then hop onto any other buses to the casinos 
the bathrooms are spacious 
the only con is the lifts - only one was working and waits were pretty long 
the only complaint i had was that the f&b options in the hotel are limited 
and you can also check into your flight from the subway station below the hotel 
complimentary internet access is available but annoyingly 
bathrooms supplied with excellent toiletries 
location is fantastic the location was the main reason i chose this hotel it 's right next to to 
airport express stataion ( hkd 60 
good pool , sauna . 
only one small check in desk for general guests so if there 's a lot of guests 
a dimmer in the bathroom would be nice 
the view from my room was n't quite like the brochure as i was on the 10th 
has a decent gym 
all necessary facilities like a pool and a gym 
has two pools one indoor and onther outside 
this place is great as it is in walking distance of the casino and is well below the cost of 
extra bed 
big nice room 
a nice lounge area for drinks in the evening with live music 
poor room 
the room and service was professional and we were provided with the kind of service you would expect from a 
with super facilities 
sleep quality not good 
along from the hotel is the harbour and it is a beautiful walk and amazing view of hk island 
the added buildings less interesting 
they have your typical amenities like free wifi service 
big and clean and reasonable price 
we arrived for lunch slightly early as the room was n't ready and no sooner had i sat down 
kowloon park is accessed via an elevated walk way that takes you to nathan road 
thus this hotel is perfect because its access is an escalator ride from the fast craft exit gates 
very good swimming pool 
at least in the tower wing are comfortable 
the executive lounge was very nice and had very good food 
the resort is absolutely off the chart good 
another excellent business hotel 
i typically stay over at the mandarin or four seasons and this location does give you some variety away 
i am a regular guest who has noted the long lines at reception 
i love the walks that you can do along the creek 
spacious modern accommodation with kitchen 
the first floor of the executive level is a bit small with narrow tables but there is more space upstairs 
the resort is gorgeous and clean and we were really impressed with the accommodation 
the resort is as good as you would expect 
comfortable apartments overlooking the lake and loads of great activities right at the resort 
great modern decor 
get in early for breakfast 
beautiful restaurants by the lake with inclusion of buffet breakfast 
the windows are tough to open and even with the windows open 
for quality and variety the breakfast is great value 
go for a high floor 
coffee and hot chocolate was great 
the new airport tram stops right outside the door of the hotel so its very easy to get to from 
there are roadworks outside so taxis can not come right up to the hotel 
the staff was very friendly and it was very clean 
the price was higher than i would normally spend and around 35 higher in edinburgh than the same night 
lunch and dinner very good 
the resort is clean and well run 
and easy access to transportation 
the trams run outside the window and you can hear and feel these 
2 ) tiled bathroom typical of hotels in the southwest 
the long pool and beach are well serviced and absolutely lovely 
as it 's a marriott you can count on the extremely good quality bed and pillow 
subway station is right below the hotel and it 's easy to get anywhere 
one tip - if you come onto hong kong island via the airport express and want to get 
the great service start at check in when reception staff sit you down and brings you fruit juices and wet 
the thing that wants me to never come back is the front desk and the housekeeping 
i love that the hotel is family friendly but has an adults only pool for those of us who do 
modern and tastefully decorated 
but an airport one 
most of the hotel staff were warm and provided good service 
i overhead the concierge offering excellent advice on dining options 
rooms are spacious and king beds very comfortable 
recommend to visit restaurants outside anyway 
there is easy access off the elevator via the basement floor to a 4 level shopping mall with more restaurants 
the three pools are nice 
we will certainly return to the jw on our next visit 
i asked about breakfast because i would be departing before the concierge lounge opened in the morning 
i spent 6 wonderful nights at the chedi muscat this past january and all i need 
it is also an easy walk to notre dame and the louvre 
have stayed many times at jw mariott and this is a very good hotel 
the hotel 's fine dining establishment silver is very pretty room and the food was very good 
i feel a little uncomfortable for the room layout and still think that at this price other places may be 
breakfast was great with a good spread 
both the public areas and the rooms are very clean 
the service was friendly 
some with a private terrace overlooking the trendy soho district and with a lot of natural light due 
the carpets are dirty looking and overall it 's dated 
the rooms are brilliant and ideal for business travellers 
great bar and excellent food 
in summary a great place to stay in hong & kong 
the bar was excellent 
basically it is a shop offering pre-packaged solutions for trips outside the hotel 
others have written about the convenient location so i will not comment about it 
had a drink at refuel and also room service and the food and drinks at the hotel are worthy of 
and then a family of monkeys walk passed your window looking in at you 
she again changed my room to which she called 2 queen beds elevated one level room to what i booked 
huge buffet 
great spacious rooms ( de luxe type ) and a nice if quirky decor 
some basic amenities i believe were missing from the room including a kettle 
habarana and the ayurvedic centre there ( for a great massage ) are an easy 
the bedroom was big but the bathroom was huge 
felt spoilt staying here - next to the conrad and shang-ri-la both quality 
the main bar had happy hour 
the ambience was nice as well 
ask for harbour view rooms located floor 17 or above 
expansive property with natural and ecological architectural features 
the bathroom is also beautifully designed 
executive floor is good value 
please note though that for the time being this is the best hotel in ulan bataar 
with a great guest barman from guangzhou filling in ( a brit by the way ) 
our suite was really big and had a very nice jacuzzi bath 
the lodge is also a short walking distance from the smaller village 
must make sure you gets one on the upper floors 
we did enjoy the hot tubs on the roof next to the spa 
you may find it 's a bit weird that at the back of the bed is a mirror 
for food across various menus available is good but nothing flash 
at the front desk 
there was no noticeable noise from the construction so that 's not an issue 
so most hotels are probably close to the harbour and restaurant areas ) 
each of which were about the same size 
great bathroom and good views of the inner harbour area 
i am giving this monaco the highest rating in spite of a housekeeping gaffe 
there were a few nice touches but it just was n't quite the quality i had expected 
it was a reasonable size 
during this time there are no facilities for executive guests 
with shopping and lots of restaurants near by 
conrad and luxury to be yourself 
and the view from some rooms and higher floors is hard to beat 
a very nice mall with dining and shopping options 
even rooms not good for the price 
those little touches make our stay so much better 
the views of the bosphorus from the hotel 's bar are stunning 
its a 20 minute walk down to the kabatas stop on the tram that takes you to 
firstly the staff are just a little bit more professional and friendly than the norm and 
the staff is great 
toilets etc ) where things fell off the wall and a colleague got trapped in the cubicle 
i think this is a good business hotel as opposed to one you would choose for a holiday 
pool facing ones are the best 
there are plenty of staff dotted around who just come up and ask if they can help you if you 
the furnishings were dated and poorly maintained - the base of the bed was frayed and the whole 
we arrived very late on friday night the receptionist was friendly and upgraded our room to a b 
and the staff were warm and helpful 
we were conscious that this hotel was u the hill some way from the old town etc 
the standards of service at this property are impeccable 
the hotel is located at the times square where shopping and food are ample 
the location is exquisite and the hotel itself even surpasses the service of the seoul jw mar 
the hotel may be under renovation but the suite is gorgeous 
- but why does internet use in your room cost about as much as a night in a decent hotel 
the excutive floor on the top floor is really nice and the view over the city is really cool 
up-to-date and cleanthere are three hotels in very close proximity to the jw 
this marriott has best location and there is a huge shopping mall in the basement 
big bath 
in the middle of town so great location to walk around would stay again 
do n't bother with a suite at double the price - not worth it 
considering the crazy prices of london hotels 
again great lighting 
we could n't have wished for a better stay 
we slept with the window open to get some fresh air circulation instead 
easy to walk to many great restaurants 
free coffee and tea at the lobby for those on the go in the morning 
bathroom is ok in terms of size and i like that it 's a standing shower 
this hotel and all his rooms category you will not have less than 32 sqm which is very decent 
thanks to the staff for trying so hard but the facilities are n't really up to scratch 
the view is good given the high floor 
breakfast was good 
convenient with direct tube line from heathrow airport to knightsbridge and a very short walk from 
good mini bar 
what can you say but fantastic nights stay 
the room was large 
the room was excellent - high quality 
the service was very attentive and they immediately fix a small issue we had with one of our window 
the in house restaurant is like a university refectory with average food and a small menu 
this hotel is one of my favorites in london 
bed and pillows very comfortable 
the suite had a lovely living room 
a great buffet spread with very friendly servers 
the rooms were combined modern amenities with the luxury of space and grandeur from yesteryear 
we were seated in a beautiful room for check-in 
the location is very strategic 
nice close walk to the tube and harrods 
a good size desk and consistently good wifi make it a good hotel if you need to work whilst the 
with an exquisite breakfast with white peach juice 
the suite was nice 
a very decent buffet at the main restaurant and a quiet italian restaurant with great service and cuisine 
my first visit to cambodia was earlier this year and i left the country with only positive 
check in was pleasant as you sit down at a desk while you checking in 
30 minutes from the airport and the rate was good value for money 
free wifi 
the staff were professional and friendly 
and a great pool 
bed was great 
several coffee shops nearby just across the street if do n't want to stay at the hotel for 
rooms were nicely decorated and spacious 
high speed internet is available for all rooms with a hd connectivity panel in the room 
bed very comfortable with a good choice of soft and firm pillows 
it was all the little touches that i liked so much 
all other hotels now seem like a bit of a disappointment 
have returned to the hotel for our annual visit and found it up to its usual good standards - clean 
the kx subway is next to the hotel so you can get anywhere in a jiff 
a good but not exceptional stay 
there is a swimming pool not that well patronised and also the club millesime on the top 
they provide a small fridge and the room was clean 
we had a large king room in the river wing 
this is really the hotel to stay in phnom penh for comfort and luxury 
you can pay for this ticket either from the drivers directly ( mostly stopping infront of this hotel probably 
the room had a wonderful view and yes the property is a little tired 
and a longish walk to the botanic gardens 
the hotel grounds are very nice but the only downside to this hotel is the beach and pool area is 
nice hotel - if you get a room with a view 
while i say this is a good location 
when we went for breakfast at the imperium we were just abandoned by the hostess and no one 
view of the weir is fantastic but noisy when the windows are open 
large bathroom 
the main pool is excellent 
the hotel has good location and it just above the admiralty mtr station 
i had the option to apply for an upgrade for a small fee - i did n't find out 
easy access to mtr 
to the wonderful breakfasts 
walk a few 100 feet out of the hotel and their are great public gardens to enjoy 
the roof leaked onto a nearby table and elsewhere onto the floor during a downpour and the red wine 
but the best thing is that there is a good supermarket there where you can buy good lunch or dinner 
the floor to ceiling glass sliding doors to the balcony with chairs and table make you feel like you are 
but still spacious and nice 
the carpet is poorly fitted and reminded me of a humid grandmother 's house 
mainly down to the poor quality of the house keeping of the room 
the lobby is grand without feeling cold and impersonal 
this is a magnificent hotel 
even the breakfast buffet was pretty bad -- probably the worst breakfast experience i have ever had in a major 
there are a number of display cases and storyboards throughout the first floor showcasing the interesting story of this 
i was abit cautious after reading many poor reviews 
the pool is open until 10pm 
being a marriott rewards member we requested some extras and the staff brought them to our room as we 
conrad have a really rather excellent upgrade facility on their website which means that if they have a room 
even poolside service was great - they bring around iced fruit smoothie shots 
breakfast was indeed good as mentioned by someone already but i also participated in a large conference at the 
the result being the waiting staff are unsure whether you are someone who has finished and is about to leave 
the food was amazing but we found that the best value was the smorgasbord available every 
com gave us free mini bar that was filled only with 2 beers 1 bottle of water and a juice 
this due to the good service and attentioned reveived whilst staying here last year 
the peninsula provides an immediate grand entrance with a large open lobby area 
only about 10-15 minutes to the main central square and 10 minutes to the river 
the mtr station admiralty is a short 10 min walk through pacific mall 
several good restaurants 
the hotel proposes a taxi service with an english speaking driver and rides baybale by credit cards 
i usually stay in kowloon but decided this trip to stay on the island side 
very friendly and entertaining staff 
the lounge is also very nice 
white marble 
the entire building was like a computerized billboard with pictures and texts 
one of the finest hotels in hk 
two big flatscreens ( no hd channels 
the lobby is vibrant hot and retro and loved the scent as you walk into thr lobby 
i managed to get 6th floor non smoking from the west wing ( garden deluxe room ) 
easy also to get to hong kong station and check in for your flight 
they want to clean the tables constantly 
i believe all the rooms are suites with a very big sitting room with a sofa sectional 
the gym is well equipped and the outdoor pool area is nice 
nick 's very good for dinner and ko was just outstanding 
the lobby is good though 
and the lobby bar and lounge is a treat to spend time in 
had an excellent business trip back to hk 
overall the suites were adequately appointed and there was no disappointment 
the room was clean and the view out of the 49th floor quite nice 
well equipped and attractively decorated 
this is a great resort for families that need extra space 
overall good hotel 
same for the steak 
i was in that hotel on several occasions during my stay in manila and glad i chose peninsula instead 
the guys at the beach that helped with the umbrellas and snorkle gear were also very 
the breakfast buffet was fresh & had a nice international selection 
however a couple of visits to the lobby coffee shop really let the stay down and reminded me of 
this was well worth it to get you quickly to the hotel hassle free 
and few huge shopping mall nearby 
which is always a nice touch 
slippers and bottle of water waiting by your bed after the evening house-keeping ( yup 
stayed 10 nights in an ocean view two bedroom villa in early february 2015 
this hotel the right size resort to enjoy and relax 
the hotel charges full 5 star-like charges for these rooms 
wish it was closer to the airport 
in asking whether a hotel or regular taxi was required the fare difference was described as 50 more 
the gym is very complete 
room service was delicious etc it was a 5 star experience 
in a great neighbourhood to boot 
gym and pool were very good as well 
i rang down to reception and they upgraded me to another room and had a person come up with the 
take the airport express train to the hong kong station ( at a one-way cost of 
it may take more detective work to choose hotels close to where your business will be conducted and the traffic 
the conference facility was fairly modern the hotel desk and concierge service were excellent with hotel cars available 
the location is great allowing you to be at the heart of the city and have the massive mall ad 
the breakfast buffet has good options 
pool is nice and breakfast is nice 
you will find the rooms very clean 
the bath looked old and the enamel was chipped in a few places 
the bed was very comfortable ( could have slept forever 
i would aim for higher floors if possible as to obtain a good view of the city 
on the plus side there is free wifi and free coffee 6-9 in the deli ( choice 
the lounge area is lovely and the desserts there are amazing 
there are enough lifts and they 're high-speed so at no point do you feel 
the staff are very kind 
liked this hotel very muchgot suite with red level accessroom little strange layout looks smaller than actually 
a big shopping mall 
the bathroom was so small that the toilet flush was jammed against the basin and kept getting stuck 
and lovely decor 
double sinks 
we enjoyed the poolside atmosphere while the gym had alot of good equipment 
if you are a big drinker you can get sloshed before you take the wife out for 
there 's a great hotel bar and the restaurant was also very good 
but suffered from the weirdest lighting system i have ever encountered in any hotel 
but ultimately reasonable value 
the bed was rather hard and there was always this strange synthetic perfume smell floating everywhere in the building 
turning on the light in the bathroom lit up the whole room 
and you will feel like you are staying in one of the hot spots in town 
very safe i was traveling alone in hong kong . 
the suite has balcony with nice view of city 
first 2 nights and later 1 night more 
hotel lobby was quite large and well decorated 
unfortunately internet access is expensive 
admiralty subway station is directly underneath and you can buy a lot of food and drinks in the 
towels from the dirty floor to use again 
right next to the central railway station 
breakfast had a great continental selection with a few hot items but mainly cold meats 
but tastefully decorated 
modern city chain hotel located in the centre of glasgow close to central station 
my room on the top 61st floor made for fabulous views even though the weather very cloudy for my 
so all facilities and modern and also with a nice style 
special mention to the concierges who suggested some great restaurants and a nightclub in a park that was 
avoid 220 as the lighting is poor and there is no view 
they will hand write a checkin for you while your luggage is delivered to your room 
convenient place and good quality 
the immediate neighborhood is not interesting with unattractive food joints and shops 
only complaint is the people using the lounge as their own living room - talking loudly in their cell phones 
the location is great 
great restaurants and very friendly staff 
one wall had been covered with birchwood panels which added light and modernity to otherwise traditional furnish 
but it 's reasonable price to travel everywhere by taxi ( us6-15 ) 
view is to inner building but quiet 
the desk had a lot of counter space 
super location on top of pacific place 
super efficient charm 
breakfast buffet is easy or grab a coffee and something simple at the cafe across the street if you 
breakfast is very expensive for what you get - best ti simply pop across the road to isad 
although the check in took a long time and was not as smooth as in equaly rated hotels the 
free internet is available at the lounge though not in the room 
there is complimentary wifi and free morning beverages 
the bathroom was also of a good size and very functional 
the live band in the lobby lounge can be noisy 
this was our third stay in a harbour view king on the executive floors ( although this time they upgraded 
one enters the pacific place mall right beside celine 
stayed here for a two days' international conference 
eventually we got the extra bed at extra cost 
approximately the same price as what we previously paid at the grand hyatt but infinitely better quality food and 
mattress and pillows were too soft 
decent bath room 
is the first hotel room that i 've stayed in which had its own exercise bike 
the beds are really comfortable with 2 huge soft pillows 
this property is a good choice 
very nice dessert 
beautiful lobby decoration and marvelous service is something that make this hotel outstanding ( even the lift is so 
and puts on a nice breakfast spread with surprising variety 
there was a strong smell of varnish in the hallway 
the bathroom is quite nice with separate shower and tub plus double sink 
ask for a high floor and enjoy the view over bangkok from the freestanding bath ( bathroom 
you can take the escalator to the second floor and walk the length of the building ( in air 
location is good right in town 
excellent facilities and superb staff 
which is a good plus at this part of the world 
it may be great for the views and cocktails but if you have breakfast here you have a limited selection 
i am just very upset that i double checked and was given the wrong information 
i arrived at the hotel at 7 am from a long over night flight and they gave me a room 
the shower was brilliant and the bed very comfortable with a range of pillows available 
the staff were friendly and professional 
we paid an upgrade and had a room where we could see the kudamm in front of the 
you can hear those great old trams even in 60th floor 
this is evident from the moment your car pulls up to the gracious lobby where you are greeted by an 
i had absolutely zero problems with the wifi which was free ( there is a faster paid option ) 
we stayed in the swissotel berlin for 5 nights the hotel was excellent and well located 
nice central hotel great rooms 
the room and staff service are excellent and professional 
that very poor internet connection is probable the weakest point of the hotel 
in less than 1km by walking could get you to platinum plaza where fashion apparel is in abundance 
room is of good size and comfortable 
ok it will not win prizes for personality but the rooms are a good size in a great location with 
friendly and professional staff 
the closest train station ( zoologischer garten ) is only about a 5 min walk and is 
it is quite spacious and the glass wall of the bathroom helps add to the openness ( there is a 
very friendly staff 
the lobby was small and there was an event every day so the lobby was usually crowded with smartly 
higher quality furnishings and bathrooms 
this is definitely great value for money 
convenient access to transport and good hospitality 
this trip i took my wife to enjoy bangkok and the hotel 
there are many decent hotels with same rate 
the bathroom was excellent with a separate tup and nice shower with hot and powerful water and soft towels 
on checking out the front desk manager said they had had no complaints before which is fine but we were 
hotel is located right in city centre 
the staff are highly trained and very hospitable and certainly know how to make each guest feel special 
very good overall 
the area is fantastic for shopping whether it be high end designer brands or cheap copy bags there is something 
the view from the lounge is also nice 
had previously been staying at the jw marriott next door but friends raved about the conrad 
taxi fare from airport to hotel costs about thb 330 ( including toll fee ) 
good place fantastic resort 
good selection of food and drinks together with great views of the harbour make this one of the best h 
but unfortunately very close to the subway and the highway 
they even kind enough to give us a very late checkout and use the lounge while we wait for our 
we had drinks at the roof top and a tasting plate from the indian restuarant 
fake antique furniture 
) thought they could get me a lower rate if they wanted too- bathroom is a little weird with 
opulent rooms lovely choice of restaurants and nothing is too much trouble 
the building is a sublime labyrinthine complex consisting of three sections resulting in a resort one kilometer long 
spacious and clean 
for the price paid you would expect a slightly more modernized room 
- water pressure in the shower extremely low 
brakfast buffet has very good choice 
great amenities ( gym 
in fact the bed was so good i had to force myself to get up 
star street wanchai with some excellent offerings for dinner and drinks and you are a mere 10 minute 
the harbour views great and the staff so polite and helpful 
the rooms are gorgeous and new 
very competitive prices 
the lounge is really great with amazing views into hong kong harbor 
the terraces are nice to view the racetrack and marina from 
the executive lounge and its evening cocktails was excellent with a great view over the harbour 
walk down another passage 
with great views of the bay and the location was very awsome 
asian hotel travelers would be disappointed with conrad hong kong lounge for sure 
hotel is very typical of marriott in the us ie not high quality but well appointed 
staff are very friendly though especially raj at the president 's club desk and the location is good 
rooms are large with an extremely comfortable bed and the pillows were like clouds 
electric curtains 
have stayed here previously on the higher executive floors and the rooms were much nicer 
room has plenty of fancy amenities 
the various food and beverage outlets to the terraces and the room 
the angle desk light in my room was broken - that was the only problem - i did not report 
you need to visit yas viceroy and not abu dhabi . 
this would have be one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in 
all the staff we encountered were friendly and the fitness centre is good 
highly recommended hotel if you have any early flight 
other buildings are adjacent and overlook most of the bedrooms 
pinpoint reading lights are hidden behind the bed and shutters must be opened before you have any idea 
plenty of excellent restaurants and shopping nearby 
great beds and nice big rooms but expensive internet usage which i did n't expect for asia and 
the furnishings were very nice and the bed was super comfortable 
friendly business hotel 
bedding in premier fairmont was comfortable and breakfast at prego was impressive 
it is just a minute or two to the citi hall mrt which is located in the basement 
big bathroom 
beautiful views and excellent breakfast 
close to the airport 
getting the shuttle bus is a bit of a scrum 
the room was nice and had all amenities one would expect from a top hotel 
bathroom was large with bath-tub and shower - amenities were also plenty . 
it has been a number of years since our last visit to singapore and we enjoyed our first stay 
and of course an excellent stay 
very nice touch 
it was an okay stay 
i preferred the great bar restaurant next door 
we did the 360 tram one day 
good location for st helier town and the free car parking was welcome 
i would also mention the comfortable bed and pillows along with a spotlessly clean room as well as 
there was a free wifi 
we noticed that on the last night the nice big bath towels we had previously had were changed for cheaper 
lounge a good selection of beverage and food 
overall a good facility 
but was surprised that restaurants did n't open until 6pm for dinner 
the bathroom was well stocked with amenities and plenty spacious 
on the 6th floor is also a hospitality room 
for airport hotel 
the property is nicely located near shopping and the very efficient singapore subway 
delicious meals 
it is right next door and has a free shuttle service from the airport 
they have free shuttle service to and from airport 
we waited a long time at check in while the check in process took even longer 
the pool is amazing and staff are among the best 
staff was very nice and the whole hotel is very beautiful 
if there is one thing the is good for fairmont apart from its outstanding ambience in the south 
the pool has an interesting layout 1 2 indoor and 1 2 outdoor but can be a bit cooler than 
the rooms are very nice and the service was excellent and had a meal as well that was good 
the public areas spectacular 
handy guest room available if you have a later flight home 
service at the front desk was ok 
this is a great airport hotel 
if you need to use the whole fridge you can pay all the minibar than use the whole 
the lobby is nice but under renovation 
it 's only a short trip to bugis 
there are clearly differences of opinion on ground floor versus upper floor and river versus mountain view 
a very good business hotel 
breakfast buffet is pretty good with lots of variety 
walk-in closet was perfect for unpacking 
probably the best hotel we stayed in during an 8 week holiday 
with all the great hotels in sg 
a short shuttle bus ride from airport 
amenities are better 
close to an mtr station , if you need to go into hk it is relatively easy 
the pools were great if you have small children 
very convenient to airport terminalscourtesy bus service is frequent & goodroom i had was ok though some 
the hotel is conveniently located close to the airport 
excellent breakfast options and good restaurants 
and buses are easy to catch for the immediate surroundings like millennium park or the art institute ( w one 
raffles across the street and best brunch in singapore - but 
there is complimentary shuttle bus service to from the aiport and it is about 10 - 15- 
breakfast was fabulous and a huge selection with great coffee 
higher floor have better view 
nice location 
you can also walk over to airport express station at the asia expo next door and it will 
lots of restaurant and bars nearby the hotel 
while there are sometimes built in annoyances like the staff hovering around the checkin desks who ask you 
takapuna has some good shops 
higher floors are good 
the front desk staff was helpful and friendly 
at the same time the location is quite good right in the marina and their fitness center is excellent 
the water will spill to the main area of the restroom 
the best lounge we ever had with a good service as well 
hot rub on balcony was nice too 
however they provide a shuttle bus services to tung chung mtr station every half an hour 
very old property like all westin 's in mexico i 've been to 
we found the room well appointed and the staff friendly and helpful 
when i asked if any more loungers were available i was told no 
i arrived to a friendly check-in 
the towels were always available by an employer in a pool house 
pool area dissapointing on our stay as one pool was closed and so only open one he 
the shuttle bus service runs timely and they came right over to the airport when i called them at nearly 
nice modern rooms and facilities access to premiere lounge for breakfast ok breakfast buffet at the lounge free shuttle to 
basic requirement of an airport hotel is convenience 
this was the closest marriott property to the airport so i picked it 
who gave this place a four diamond rating ? 
the business centre is efficient and the internet connection in the rooms works well 
may be next trip 
good restaurants within walking distance and some very good tourist things nearby 
this is a very good airport hotel 
great toiletries 
the hotel is connected to a shopping centre which is good and chimjes across the road has plenty 
hotel is in an excellent location 
the toilet and bath fixtures were nice 
and families with kids would probably enjoy staying in that one 
some rooms in the same category have terrible views so make sure you are aware of what view you are 
the beds are super comfortable and bathroom 's design modern and easy to use 
but was very disappointed with the overall service of this overpriced hotel 
powerful showerluxurious 
i though check in was a bit slow and the hotel restaurants were all closed by the time we got 
i havent yet really zeroed in on a preferred hotel but the raffles comes very clso 
if you are in hong kong overnight and want to stay close to the airport this is a 
what makes the place truly special is the quality of service willingly and sincerely given by the staff ( fair 
the club bay room was a loft kind of space and the huge floor-to-ceiling glass 
just what we needed arrived early in morning two of us plus daughter and two grandchildren - all very tired 
just be sure to book in advance because the aqua rooms are rarely unoccupied 
it would have been perfect if the bathroom came with a proper door 
the gym is great 
there are several souvenir shops across the street 
conveniently located close to airport with shuttle service 
the rooms were large and clean and very quiet and the ibis is cheaper than mercure 
they will try to charge you without even telling you 
good quality breakfast in the small restaurant next door 
certainly there was lots of space and a good sized bathroom with lots of good pressure hot water 
they told me to visit their desk in arrivals next time to get to the hotel 
lovely hotel near airport 
it was a good value 
very good for a hotel of this class 
request high floor 
basic 3 star in the cbd stayed here overnight for work . 
plenty of everything you need within an easy walk 
traffic noise was a hum in the background but you can hear sirens from a mile away 
good temperature and you dont hear the noise from the bars unlike others in the city 
great pool for lap swimmers like me 
bathroom was spacious too with nice white company toiletries 
sat & sun nights the apartments were taken over volumes of young people intent on making as much noise as 
with all basic amenities that is required for long stay 
the pillows were like pancakes 
staff a little bit short on the ground . 
concierge lounge was great 
the lifts were slow and a colleague was unfortunate and got stuck in one of them for 30 minutes 
we got so fed up we even walked down 15 flights on one occasion 
is still very convenient to the city of hong kong 
really impressive location and viewslift queues were a bit long - check in and car parking easy 
they upgraded to a higher floor and we are very pleased with the outcome 
the hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to and from airport 
the living dining area was clean and spacious with panoramic windows allowing plenty light and access to the 
good restaurant and excellent breakfast 
i was impressed when we ordered a taxi for the early flight that they ordered a bigger van to take 
access to the executive lounge and the double glazing 
minor stuff in the big picturethe miracle of this hotel however is what separates this hotels business behavior 
it 's an excellent airport hotel 
the rooms were bright and airy 
nice executive lounge 
so i had a very expensive afternoon at the shops - meriton apartments are convenient for central syd 
bathroom is good 
the food at breakfast is great with plenty to choose from 
although the place is due for renovation 
water got spashed and leaked all over the floor when you take a shower 
i ended up taking room service just so i could read and eat 
excellent location and just a short 5 minute ride to the v&a waterfront 
the buffet continental breakfast was fabulous 
we ordered room service on the last night of our stay and it arrived quickly and was delicious 
and we would certainly consider staying here again on our next visit to this beautiful city 
the bed was a double and it was comfortable 
the bed was comfortable and the bathroom had everything we needed 
good value 
if you enjoy a good walk it 's not problem 
the bed was comfortable but the pillow was way too flat and thin 
bathroom is big however the rain shower only trickled out water 
hurry into the bathroom to start a nice hot shower 
sitting in the living room or the bedroom the views of the harbour and the hong kong 
nothing was too much trouble for this hotel including servicing my room at a time convenient to me . 
as a club room guest the lounge on the top floor was great and the evening tea and snacks were 
but quite a distance from old town 
staff was all top notch 
did not use the gym but enjoyed a good scottish breakfast before departure - great porridge and 
from all the rave reviews you would think this is an amazing hotel 
the parking is a bit far 
the room was good 
but the amenities were excellent with everything you need either in the room or available 
which is a great facility 
these were both of excellent quality and beautifully presented 
which was a really good size and very well appointed 
a pricey place but worth it 
but behind the facade is a very modern 
cocktails at the hotel are lovely 
the westin hotel is on the edge of the central business district of cape town - all central sights 
the only irritation was that the nightly turndown service acted as if there was only one occupant in 
have stayed in newcastle in several hotels over recent years 
free lounge area on level 9 where you can relax while waiting for evening night flight 
or there is always the option to use the regular hotel shuttle bus service 
free mini bar 
try for top floor 
good value 
the hotel is close to cape town 's commercial heart 
great bed and shower 
there is a good swimming pool 
the tesla car service to the airport was quick and efficient 
the free shuttle to and from waterfront is very convenient 
the rooms are nicely done and breakfast was good 
they provided us with a good coffee machine 
the hotel is centrally located near the station towards the bottom of grainger street and off westgate road 
with a huge pillar in the middle - too close to the check-in desk so you have to 
at last - a good ihg in newcastle 
sorry for late review 
especially after being given a nice suite upgrade - very clean with good housekeeping - nice breakfast options in 
this appears to be a fairly newer hotel with a nice enterance and lobby area 
as a mr platinum i was given an executive room with free minibar and free breakfast 
the good - the bed is very comfortable 
best hotel in south africa by far . 
very clean and nicely decorated 
the fabulous harbour view bedroom was out of this world and all the facilities of the highest standard 
best hotel i have visited in the last 2 years 
so the lobby is a bit small in my opinion and there seemed to be a lot of time spent 
with a direct walking access to dubai mall and burj khalifa 
the club lounge is a bit on the small size and can get quite crowded at times 
it is class all the way with the hotel decor elegant 
the cabanas by the pool are quite nice 
a c smells fresh 
which are good for families with kidsit is attached to the mall with all famous brandsi took my 
great location on the biggest mall in dubai my next time to vist dubai i will go 
great beds 
the king size bed is very comfortable 
imagine the experience of coming down to breakfast only to find buffet is what you have to have 
ask for a high floor and there is no noise 
free minibar ( soft drinks 
the reception area is slowly small but nicely decorated 
unfortunately melbourne had a week of 40 degree weather and the hotel aircon just did 
staff were good and the restaurant affordable with good food 
i always take the lake view rooms and they are not bad 
only thing is that soft drinks are very expensive so rather fill up at the supermarket which is around the 
it just got better . 
we made use of the free shuttle bus ( with free wi-fi 
the lobby and the restaurant is very stylish 
queen and or diplomat with plenty of fresh breads 
from check in to check out we were treated to exceptional guest service 
give it an edge over many of the more expensive hotels in hkour only issue is the one 
it is a smallish boutique hotel 
rooms and amenities are very good 
there is a heated pool 
i stayed at the park for 2 nights and overall had a pretty good stay 
the ground floor restaurant bar is also excellent but time to time serving is a bit slow 
the bed and bath are clean and comfortable 
and the little touches of a quality apartment was lost 
the pool area was rather nice and the gym looked out to the harbor 
we got one right near the beach and had fabulous views 
from the moment we arrived we were treated like vips 
this was my first stay in a flagler club room 
the bed was a bit hard for me ( they like their hard beds in se asia 
room on the highest floor was huge 
and there is free internet 
from hkg international airport 
check in staff iis weak for not able to locate our luggage we left a few days earlier resulting 
i feel the hotel should half the prices and re-name the hotel as a conference centre to better 
these guys are top notch 
the nearest metro is also at coex 
cool or hip 
i was impressed by kind staffs 
great location to explore and excellent facilitiesstaff very friendly and communicated well before visitfortunate as ih 
the only part was the free internet service which worked at a good speed 
the wifi is fast and free 
beijing is a nice city 
there is free internet in the rooms but you need a laptop to be able to connect to it 
i 'd recommend this hotel for a business trip or if you are looking for an affordable stay during 
the breakfast buffet is great and the dinner buffet has a 2 or 3 month wait so if you can 
very good business hotel for beijing 
comfy beds ( unusual for the region ) and good service 
have recently completed my second trip to hotel icon and ca n't wait to go again 
which are pretty deserted apart from the duty free shop that has busloads of mainland chinese visiting daily 
you should have a massage while you are there 
free minibar and free smartphone to call in 27 cauntry out of hk 
a good gym and a nice out door pool 
this hotel is a great value with very good location 
on both occasions the food arrived within 30 minutes and the serving size was generous 
certainly being free is a big plus 
duty manager and the whole team invested much time and efforts for ensuring a quality stay 
upon requesting to have a better upgrade 
we found a number of reasonable non-smoking restaurants that were an easy walk from the hotel and thought 
the hotel staff were friendly and the location was really nice and was able to see some sights in the 
this hotel is unique as it is run by a bunch of enthusiastic trainee youngsters 
whilst via email our transfers etc were well dealt with at the front desk the concierge was 
the concierge was really efficient and polite on removing our luggage from the taxi while we went to 
it was only a 5 min taxi ride to the station and the twin room we had was nice 
many luxury malls and the main food court 
main tourist attractions like forbidden city are not far away 
we stayed here for 2 nights and had breakfast one morning at 8 
if i walked to an adjacent bar i could get a cup of coffee there for free 
the girl on reception was rude and said if you dont come down hen tough 
i liked the fact that the windows opened so i did n't have to survive on air con 
the meals is very good although not fine dinning standard 
the bathroom was the most disappointing and amenities were the biggest let down 
maple leafs artfully embedded in the floor in a non-cheesy tasteful manner 
food quality is poor and seating inadequate 
the area was quiet 
other guests dropped in late in the evening to have a quick coffee and collect bottled water 
helpful staff 
the croissants and french pastries on offer were as good as anything you would find in fr 
this hotel is definitely one of the best hotels i have been 
it 's easier to take the limousine bus direct to conrad hotel 
the fitness center is large and well-appointed 
the front desk staff are extremely courteous and helpful 
the bathroom is huge with a double sink 
the hotel is in a great location right next to the cn tower 
we are very much looking forward to our stay next month 
the broken furniture and dirty surfaces are a dead giveaway 
they had a boxful behind the front desk and obliged immediately 
we could feel the historical story of this hotel and surprisingly we did not feel the hotel was old 
the hotel is near everythingthe staff were helpfulhaving a kitchen was just wonderfulwould stay there again 
the room was very comfortable as was the bed 
only the sheet was a bit to short to cover the full bed . 
bathroom had the smallest shower but also had a shower over the bath 
it was a transition to autumn and the hotel converted the air-conditioning systems to the heater systems 
it is most often because the type of room you booked is not available and not to please you 
located adjacent to the train station and across the street from lake como 
the hotel did try to make it better by financial recompense but the bottom line is that i would 
and listening to waves crashing into the rocks right below made for an unusual setting 
walked downstairs and got on the plane 
having been to two restaurants i can only say they were both disappointing with typical uninspiring hotel menus 
dining perk ) 
the only noise was some inconsiderate guests talking loudly in the hallway 
3 or 4 different types of ants in our outside area 
grounds around the pool need nice landscaping 
having had a very stressful trip i elected for some comfort 
there is a nice gym next door 
to fill up the hot tub you needed to use a hose next to it which constantly came off because 
where they were complimentary for the guests 
good hotel 
which for a week stay was very annoying especially if you are want to work or watch a movie in 
this experience ruined an otherwise pleasant stay with the hotel and all the effort other hotel staff put in was 
we especially liked the large stone outdoor bathtub 
location close to the railway station was perfect for us 
the place is away from any major shops or shopping areas 
this kowloon property is a gem 
with wonderful views from the lobby and various restaurants 
good english at front desk 
i had to ask the front desk to call someone to hail the taxi because no one was at the 
fast hotel boat trip to male and efficient and pleasant check-in 
the spa was good 
the food at the hotel was excellent and the people went out of their way to serve 
spacious bathroom with separate shower 
a corner room on a high floor for the best views 
think black elegant marble and muted metallic colours 
it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in 
the property is adjoined next to the mgm grand 
we ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast and dinner which were both excellent and good value 
well run operation - but food very pricey and limited outdoor spaces 
but the nice hotel really made my stay enjoyable 
there is a free drink each evening of your stay as well 
the public areas are good 
the lobby lounge serves one of the best fruit juices which we had for welcome drinks 
a coffee in the lounge will set you back about 10 usd 
5 miles away . 
separated shower room and toilets 
great staff in the dining room with efficient service 
the service is sublime and there 's a friendly vibe among guests 
this hotel is a very special one if you are looking for a relaxed and quiet spot 
hotel is handy to the beach and the restaurants on the busy main road 
the bed was very comfortable with high thread count cotton sheets and the noise level was low 
staff got my booking wrong and tried to charge more than the quoted price 
the bar area is one of the best views you will get with a glass wall looking across the bay 
the executive one bedroom is large enough and well equiped 
small bedroom with proper bed and small but well designed bathroom 
great value 
parking easy and good value for sydney 
ideal for planespotters and very close to the airport 
breakfast was adequate and a little like an airport cafe 
the clock next to the bed was an hour ahead even though they had changed to winter time a month 
the gym is pretty large with a huge amount of machines and cardio - perfect to work off all the 
the king bed was very comfortable but 
i experienced fast and personalised check-in and my upgraded suite was luxuriously comfortable and offered 
they had nice smoked salmon 
the junior had a great view and was very spacious 
if you are in jerusalem and you are looking for a luxury and pleasant stay you have to choose 
huge bed 
the entire gym is for everyone and they have weights and other machines on what i called the women side 
the hotel staff were friendly but definitely a lot more commercial than the people we had met at various cas 
the swimming pool on the roof is the highlight of this place and we had a pizza up there one 
spacious bathroom 
we had a good view but the windows were very dirty 
the service from staff and the location 
i would recommend one of the many other local restaurants where your money will go twice as far 
with large rooms 
bring your own toiletries 
i stayed with my family overnight on a flight back from bangkok landing at dubai and all i 
hotel is close to the airport 
they have a shuttle service between the airport and hotel and it is free 
so efficient and quick and very pleasant with the guests 
due to the above parameters and also the fact that the hotel is close to the airport and we can 
the front desk and concierge staff looked tired most of the day 
lovely roof top swimming pool with great views and a nice snack and drinks bar 
they could have at least made the window bigger 
a great setup with amazing views 
reassuringly typical of the top end big city hotel 
the beautiful elegance decoration and services are the best 
as a business traveller the hotel is a perfect distance from airport and my customers the room is very good 
spent a lot of time on the sofa next to the window 
there is a free transfer after you get off at kowloon station 
when i order vegetarian dishes and explicitly say no fish 
complimentary coffee 
the buffet breakfast was very good with lots of choices and hot food and the restaurant was very elegant with

friendly staff and a great restaurant for meat 
a harbour view is a must 
i stay at a lot of hotels and this one is in dire need of updating 
the beds were amazing - super comfortable with a pillow top 
was pleasantly surprised by the huge size of the rooms and quietness of the hotel 
valet parking is 16 and self parking is not convenient . 
many better hotels in hong kong today 
you can also visit the taipei train station underground street where there are tons of small shops 
downstairs it has nice bars and coffeshops 
etc so i wasnt able to comment and with indifferent staff i didnt see the point in feeding back 
extra free android phone with free 3g and free phone calls ( even to some other countries ) 
apart from the price it is difficult to find fault although it is not a great place for those 
breakfast was good and the coffee tasted wonderfully different somehow 
the only criticism was that the room was too hot and i could n't get the temperature down and 
the longemont is a nice business hotel that i would consider staying again if i was doing business 
all the basic amenities 
i would definitely stay at the regent in shanghai again 
and great room

with fresh egg dishes made for us at request 
not brilliant but fabulous spa 
so nice to walk right out and have the harbor and a nice shopping district right there 
the gym facilities were excellent and we very much enjoyed using the pool every day 
the decor was circa 80 's and for such a large hotel 
the conference venue was nicely arranged and the lunch and dinner arrangements were beyond expectations . 
to match the serious luxury chains like mandarin oriental 
showers excellent and the breakfast perfect 
hotel in excellent location close to the night market with good bars 
if want a hotel with a great harbour view good location stay here especially if you get good room rate 
however my teenage daughters loved it and the chef made special pizzas just for them 
the housekeeping staff was excellent 
in hong kong there are some hotels which i like more 
there are also some shops and malls nearby 
they organised our accomodation in the next few cities we were staying in and were very acc 
amazingly firm mattress that i loved 
we enjoyed the room and the hotel immensely

the room was excellent and very well appointed 
there are a lot of great hotels in hk so i always struggle to decide which one to stay 
the entire experience was wonderful from check-in 
requested and was granted late checkout 
beautifully decorated and perfect 
it does have a good range of treatments which are not surprisingly on the expensive side 
large closets and everything you can expect ( except a nespresso machine which would have been convenient 
there is a large building being erected adjacent to it 
there was a separate area to check in but not clearly indicated 
the location was also very convenient 
the setting was beautiful 
the counter height of the bathroom sink was higher than normal 
it 's not in a super crowded area but still close enough to market street and union square to 
breakfast was only so-so in terms of taste and service was pretty slow 
tablet controls for lights and window coverings were mis-wired and non-functional for the duration 
after just over 15 minutes i gave up as i needed to go to the airport- very poor 
however retrieved me from lobby internet and quickly upgrade me and i had my room type request on the 
several hipster coffee spots within a couple blocks 
the manager at the front desk told me he trusts me - but he could n't do anything about 
and nice large windows in the bedroom 
the bathroom spacious 
besides this it was a great stay 
there are public showers ( 3 ) on the pool deck 
we have always had a great stay and the rooms have always been immaculate 
the only downside for me and why i gave 4 and not 5 stars was that we specifically booked a 
the buffet breakfast spread is good 
the pool was lovely 
beautiful bathrooms with top quality amenities and very nice covered bathroom slippers - none of that cheap open 
the swimming pool down a long corridor on the 6th floor was very nice 
very cold and the temperature control 
good layout 
the best gym and pool

nice bench for the free weights available etc 
we enjoyed the wonderful pool and cascading hot tub with fabulous views of the city - and the bar 
excellent breakfast and very helpful front desk staff 
cereals and some hot dishes 
right in the old town 
this is not your pool spot . 
the view over hkg is simply the best in town and the service is amazing 
the models of cars parked outside the hotel are also worth a visit 
internet was very slow and did n't work properly in the hotel 
my wife and i each used our free night from the ihg credit card for the 2 
stayed there for business- the staff was very cheerful and helpful - u cud see the smiles 
room was large and comfortable and good restaurants are within 2 blocks 
there are plenty of great hotels in bangkok but this one is intimate 
the club lounge has wonderful views and the food is incredible 
the eating and drinking venues terrific and the service suburb 
the concieger staff a bit slow as well 
the bathroom is spacious with separate bath and shower 
night time is no way to sleep with open windows 
at the hotel we were met by name and checked in rapidly with welcome drinks and personalized service 
both in what 's on offer on the various buffets and the outside balcony area 
located in the bustling area of bangkok but when you go inside the siam 
we used the gym and the swimming pool 
huge bathroom 
unfortunately the top pool

this hotel is located in a great location 
the beds were very comfortable indeed and we both had a good nights sleep in a room with 2 double 
the view of some rooms is very beautiful but many of the rooms are quite outdated 
the is the only holiday inn in central london with a 1 minute walk from a central and large 
however a big disappointment is that wifi internet is not free and is expensive 
comfortable and clean in a good locale 
as it is a lovely property but i will restate what i saw in other reviews 
club house and swimming pool are very serenely enclosed 
for the rates we paid it is good value for money as the room is spacious enough for two if 
very staff friendly 
the bar s an happening place with excellent cocktails by a very skilled team 
the location was ideal for us 
, service from front of house staff is excellent certainly i m returning 
stylish boutique when it first opened that pushed the design envelope 
hotel they run the complimentary shuttle on hourly basis to the exclusive beach 
good carpets 
the 4 o'clock check in is a little inconvenient and check in on a saturday at 4 
the only good thing is that you can avoid the busy elevators 
the beach facility is a short ride away 
the staff is very friendly and helpful 
the ground is not as expansive as that of the newer resorts 
nice fresh rooms 
the charge for parking overnight as a guest is over 30 with taxes 
bathroom has a decent size and water pressure can be pretty low 
drinks & appetizers at outdoor bar by the restaurants were great 
the occasional screams and laughter of the children were pleasant esp when you get to sit by their balcony and 
particularly the nasi lemak- very fragrant rice with sedap-ly spicy samb 
this was my first visit to the holiday inn express in bangkok 
everything in the bathroom works although the faucet barely clears the sink edge so good for filling a 
getting from the reception area to your room requires going up two floors on escalators 
the bathroom was large and spacious and the shower had satisfactory enough pressure and the water was very soft 
typical hi express beds that is rather comfy with choice of firm or soft pillows 
the regency club had a very nice layout and several food and beverage choices 
it has all the amenities you may need including several power adapters 
the trolley does stop convenient just out front of the building 
marriott should either fire their designers or charge less for a sub grade product 
room was quiet even though it overlooked busy lobby 
location was fine for the convention centre and easy access to wanchai mtr station 
pay to play wifi ( which continues to annoy me ) - this is a hotel you sleep in only 
this property has a superb location ( door step to bts station ) and a walking distance to various 
but i was impress by the location and the modern room for the price 
so you can avoid the terrible bangkok traffic 
excellent exec lounge 
love the choice of soft or hard pillows 
great location and excellent staff 
we stayed 6 nights in the building closest to playa blanca ( room 3306 ) and could 
pre-arrival communications with the hotel were excellent and 
i find the room lighting dim as i love rooms that are bright 
the resort is located is a very location 
the rooms are outrageously small 
breakfast buffet is excellent with not only the egg omelette chef but also a pancake chef 
) as well as beautiful bathroom 
in our two week holiday around south island this was the most expensive lodging we stayed at and the only 
the rooms have been remodelled since our last stay and although i am a fan of contemporary design the 
considering that tagaytay is known to be a foodie 's haven - with fresh 
this hotel really needs some upkeep 
service and staff all great 
you can even see the symphony of lights at 8 pm every night from the comfort of your own 
highly recommend this hotel if you 're traveling to hong kong 
our 2-story room was quite good with a comfy bed 
check your cctv records 
and they had free wifi 
ask about which rooms do n't have stairs if this is an issue 
these phone calls were little mini disasters in that noone could locate a manager or anyone responsible for room 
the beer was not cold enough and the cocktails did not seem to contain very much alchohol 
bedroom upstairs with balcony and a great view overlooking the lake 
we stayed in a one bedroom lakeside view apartment 
location is a little off from the main district of shops 
rooms are small ( no carpet ) and functional 
a great resort and the rooms are good 
the hotel 's air conditioning 
it just had this musty smell - the floor and the actual room 
this was a nice play to stay 
five-star quality and the place is spotlessly clean 
the food was good 
there was one bedroom with a king bed and separate ensuite and another room with two single beds and 
this property is excellent and matches the thong lor marriott in quality 
there is a big supermarket in the nearby emporium mall if you would like to buy some snacks 
would be a solid 5 stars but room service was disappointing on the second visit 
there were some nice restaurants nearby and it was close to china town 
get access if you can 
central to many restaurants and attractions 
the property is huge and has two towers but only one seems to be functional presently 
the layout of the hotel is also a bit strange - long escalator from the entrance to the lobby 
the rooftop suite where we had our meetings and the outdoor veranda for lunches were wonderful choices 
contributor in trip advisor i wanted to ensure that we do go to the best hotel 
otherwise not so many good restaurants around 
love the little coffee shop on the ground floor 
well maintained rooms 
the bed was very comfortable with ample pillows 
this has london 's best lobby 
the hotel lobby restaurant offers breakfast and dinner menus 
flaws little far from the beach with only transport available from 7 am - 7 pm 
panjim and other attractions but if you are focused traveller who just needs to have peace all around 
the morning breakfast experience is as close as i ever hope to come to being in a factory production line 
probably one of the best valued suites in hong kong 
the infinity pool was like a dreamland where you are surrounded by swaying palm trees and poetic farmland 
the rooms are magnificent and the resturants fantastic led by alain ducass and china 
the front desk were friendly 
this is a fantastic hotel with incredible security and awesome service from the staff 
a couple of weight machines and free weights 
pricey but overall good property 
room and amenities wise 
it may be a bit older and further away from the action in mega kuningan but the positives 
the service by the reception staff was excellent but the lobby area to wait for a taxi was incredibly dis 
the room was generous in size with a large bathroom 
be aware that rooms on the lower floors have not been refurbished and they are old 
fresh and i had a lovely warm shower 
location is perfect with easy access also to kowloon 
fairly good airport hotel 
the front desk and valet staff 
food was good and the staff pleasant 
service was fantastic all round 
the gym is more than adequate for a large hotel 
the pool and garden area is excellent which makes it a great hotel to come to with a family 
and we were picked up at the airport by the complimentary hotel shuttle bus 
good airport hotel 
the lobby is grand and beautiful 
breakfast is good with a good spread 
go for lounge access if you can 
club floor rooms with lounge access - worth the extra if you are n't upgraded due to status with 
the room is not as nice and the club room facilities are not nearly as good as the grand hy 
breakfast spread is good in variety 
even if this is a busy airport hotel 
the gym is one of the best that i 've ever seen 
luxury right in the heart of chaos 
rest of the furniture is old 
the lobby bar is busy 
also at the front desk 
bats bar is an amazing place to hang out 
food in the chinese restaurant was pleasant and gym was very modern and clean 
it is only a short 10 minute walk to the beach and the major shopping centre in kuta 
easy walk way direct to hotel 
and the shangri-la is located in an area a little south of the centre 
breakfast buffet is exceptionally good 
as its the last of four hotels on this route 
all of the amenities were first-rate and the towels and linens were very fine 
with a separate walk in closet dressing room ( where all of our bags could be kept and clothes hung 
the service is really good and rooms are very clean 
- i 'm just hoping that our last couple of days go without any more hitches and then 
wardrobe space is limited as there were two small drawers although the hanging space is good 
i found the top rack in the bathroom where towels are kept full of dust which is astonishing at a 
large bathroom and huge closet changing room 
which is all well & good but the room service menu was really limited 
good value for what you get 
it was a nice touch for the reception to call you by name when they answered the phone 
i loved the beautiful lobby and gorgeous peacock alley lounge ( photos attached ) 
the pool is large 
great walk-in closet with lots of space and the standard peninsula valet box 
i used luxury hotels and diamond privilege for my booking and found checkin frustrating 
where the equipment provided was just of un-heard quality ( brand new nike set for everyone ) 
sleep quality was good 
the beds were firm enough and the pillows were soft yet offer great support 
fantastic hotel in a great shopping city 
the staff at the hotel was very nice though and they certainly did their best every time i needed something 
the cupboard that you place things in for the butler is a great idea 
take the airport express to kowloon station and then from the station the complementary shuttle bus that makes 
ten seconds walks from the terminal 
great pool and spa area with good views 
quite convenient location 
the room is appropriate with a simple bathroom 
and occupying two double beds 
the concierge provided friendly and efficient service and throughout my stay everything worked like clockwork 
the pool and the jacuzzi are very well appointed and a very enjoyable place to wind down 
we enjoyed the keepers bar downstairs and we had a beer in the late evening though the service was 
hence you need to keep your curtains closed and there can be noise 
city hotels are good value at weekends 
clean and the beds were comfortable 
choose the 24th floor if you have the time 
the bar service was very good - we should have stayed there for dinner ( restaurant menu is also served 
room was comfortable and a decent size 
lovely spacious room with great shower and efficient wifi 
the holiday inn is perfectly located - walk out of the departures and across the courtyard and you 're 
the imperial gardens and the financial district 
we only stayed here one night between flights 
front desk is helpful but could really do with more personnel during peak periods of the day as you can 
staff is very friendly and helpfull 
a second night with the window open was noisy and unpleasant 
do n't be fooled by the nice reception the rooms are simply out of date decor 
we had already spent time in santiago when we arrived in sa and decided to stay at the 
the spacious layout of the rooms 
30 am for which we were very grateful after a long flight 
it is exactly outside the main terminal building 
rooms comfortable excellent bedding good bathroom and room amenities including universal adapters 
the rooms were spacious 
the main point that triggers me to give them the worst rating possible is the taxi service 
i opted for the double bed 
this is close to the airport by free shuttle and even if you are staying on in hong k 
the hotel is conveniently located at the wtc 
we did not make use of the free airport shuttle bus because our flight was early in the morning 
but you can eat cheaper in the adjacent mall if you do n't feel like taking the train into 
but the undercover parking provides very convenient access directly into the hotel 
however the hotel is conveniently situated next to and connected to the airport terminal 
hotel is beautiful and clean with nice staff 
00 am which is great if you have a early flightvery nice lobby and staff 
the shuttle to v&a waterfront was a nice offering and the hotel transfer to airport was competitively 
the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom contained a large window with a blind to screen those using the 
usually cheaper than the other two hotels close to hkg airport 
this is ok for us as it is closer to airport for our transit flight out the next day 
restaurant offered a full buffet or a light menu selection which was perfect 
the immediate area is filled with shops and restaurants 
about 15 minutes by complimentary shuttle from the airport 
beware construction work outside 
the bed was super comfy and i liked the pillows 
the room was very comfortable 
nhowever im not exactly sure it 's value for money 
a very good airport hotel 
was the horrible valet service when parking one 's car 
we checked out the 2 restaurants and of course the prices were ridiculous - do n't get me wrong 
i was on floor 10 - the bathroom was massive with a poor use of space - a shower tub 
the airport shuttle was prompt and quick--about 5 minutes to the hotel 
the hotel made life very easy for me to book and pay on their behalf 
the room upgrade was very nice and the location was very good 
premier are on the upper floors 
large bathroom and breakfast from 3am to 10am 
the bed was lovely and the bathroom huge with an awesome double shower head 
and another wet bar with a stocked mini bar 
and the efficient shuttle service 
our room was rather big and in good condition 
room amenities were nice 
thailand is know for friendly hotel service 
the hotel has a great pool area ( we did n't use is as we were only there a 
as this is the only hotel actually at the airport it is a perfect location 
near airport and hotel do provide complimentary shuttle service ( both ways ) 
i mean u guys better to book room with that eiffel tower view 
eiffel view and great value 
the free shuttle bus from the airport was prompt and efficient 
room was good comfortable bed plenty of pillows good tv with lots of channels mini bar bath robes and 
the breakfast is also average 
pool were great to use 
the lack of towels in the room i had to request towels after the room was serviced and these 
our room was a large size and probably the best that we have had in our four weeks in euro 
can walk to the airport in 5 min and there is also non-stop shuttle buses 
competitively price 
i find the bed a little too soft for comfort 
the windows provide really good sound insulation 
great place for early flights 
conveniently located by airport 
i enjoyed my included breakfast the following morning down in one of the restaurants where they had a huge buffet 
the bathroom has an open shower that sets the whole bathroom under water and the breakfast buffet is so- 
i would certainly return to the hotel for a transit and the chance to use the cable car ride nearby 
very practical in an airport if you ask me 
the complimentary airport shuttle was a bonus though 
busy with traffic 
many public buses to airport or city 
amazingly atmospheric bar - red velvet 
uncomfortable furniture 
there is a big shopping mall by the hotel 
the pool is fantastic and tropical with a swim up pool bar 
the front desk had to be called 
there 's free airport transfers 
the pool opens at 8am 
the shuttle bus is free and runs every few minutes and takes all of 5 minutes to get to and 
it worked out much the same price and much easier at the hotel 
so between the temperature and the hard bed 
the complimentary shuttle to and from the airport is frequent and efficient 
the free airport shuttle 
it is only 10 minutes drive from the airport and the hotel runs very regular free shuttle buses 
have connecting directly to airport 
breakfast spread very good and plenty to choose from 
well maintained rooms and helpful staff 
we chose this hotel as we arrived into hk at 6pm and wanted to be close to the 
the range of issues i experienced at this hotel make it clear to me that service levels overall in h 
it 's a 40 minute trip into the city proper so if you want to stay at the airport 
sokolniki park is right there too and good for a walk 
the hotel lobby is also a very busy passageway for those going to the outlet mall or passing 
30am opening for breakfast for early departures was a bonus 
and the coffee was weak 
good hotel near airport 
and very handy for the airport 
we had an overnight stay at the hotel to catch an early flight the next morning 
but next to big shopping mall4 
not for anything else close to the main city 
the spa is excellent too 
only book this hotel if you must 
the view is wide in spite of only city-view 
room service is quick but the food is mediocre 
especially for japan but they are long overdue for refurbishment 
the hotel is very close to the airport 
right next door is a big shopping mall which houses the subway station that connects you to yokoh 
we had an early morning flight back to the usa from thailand 
great location on a stop over the novotel citygate changed me opinion of this hotel chain 
the hotel is of the highest quality and not as expensive as some of you may think 
dated and worn furniture 
we loved the huge pool and side canals 
opted for the airport hotel as we had an early flight out of bkk 
the lobby is huge 
perfect for a an early flight out of hk without the fuss of heading into the city 
the main sleeping area looked quite dated ( dark 
we were met with genuine thai hospitality at a very well designed hotel with rooms at par with the 
avoiding to take taxi to the village - you can deal for thb 300 one way 
around 6pm we left for the lounge for happy hour 
the restaurants are very good especially the beach club for long lunches & again charming service 
so good just for drinks 
chinese restaurant was good and breakfast buffet was fine and varied 
the gardens and pool areas are probably one of the most interesting i 've ever seen 
the lobby was recently refurbished and looks great too 
the concierge was not friendly or helpful when asked about local places to eat - she seemed to 
took an extra shower for the shear enjoyment of it 
that 's great for guests 
the cabanas and the cushioned loungers had reserved signs on them which meant you need to 
clean and modern bath-room 
hotel has good access to shopping centre 
the beds were quite hard 
hot asian dishes 
in all other respects it was well located and good value for money with excellent service 
the swimming pool on the 4th floor is small but nice 
rooms are n't a big size but everything is very clean 
exemplary cleanliness and amazingly friendly staff 
just a great place to stay over the weekend 
the concierge and the reception were excellent 
amenities also available 
room and facilities are nice but do n't expect anything out of the ordinary 
the gym is pretty good for this class of hotel and the machinery was new and well maintained 
very good hotel city center 
we could walk to everywhere we wanted to visit and the area felt safe to walk around in the evening 
second the bathroom provides no place to store your personal items 
or hop onto the cab at hong kong station and pay less than 30 hkd for 
but the bathroom is a little qurky 
got return ticket for the a11 bus for hk65 dollars at one of the kiosks 
the room is cosy but fully functional and a very nice shower room 
definately my go to hotel for my next london trip 
restaurants are of a high standard and pool is perfect to cool off after a busy day in 
we were on a higher floor and the view was outstanding 
extra space was nice 
the facilities were clean and adequate 
modern decoration and was perfectly clean 
rooms away from the front lobby face the old walled city and if you can get up high 
night before early flight 
the bar is comfortable but prices are fairly steep 
high floor will offer you a fantastic view over the city 
since there are plenty of great restaurants around 
pool area sterile and a small reasonably equipped gym 
i was in a room without an upgraded view and the view overlooking the parliament was superb 
quiet hotel just right for early flight 
i stayed for one night 
the lobby is quite busy all the time 
i told them i had changed clothes and could not come to desk . 
my dinner for one was almost 70 - 
the restaurant menu is limited and the terminal is undergoing renovations 
and we had a very enjoyable dinner 
the lobby feels crampped and the receptionists were not very inviting 
toilet amenities was good 
the staff were highly trained and the service was impeccable as was the food which i found to be 
spacious walk-in shower with dual shower heads ( hand-held and sunflower ) 
carmine 's etc onsite and you will not have any problem finding your likings 
this is one of the best hotels i have stayed in my life till now 
close to transport 
the hotel is conveniently located for wanchai mtr 
the hotel staff are efficient but communication can be a bit rough and they do n't have enough patience 
but executive lounge hostesses are really nice 
my advice is to get friendly with a taxi driver so you can escape to reality between water slides 
good breakfast and good cocktails at the bar 
in the end i got my room lucky at the same rate 
high floor otherwise you have the noise from the pool if you are inward 
stayed in this hotel just for one night and if you have to move around wanchai and 
breakfast terrace was great though 
the main bedroom was big with a very fancy bathroom 
new bars and restaurants 
i will never give a hotel without free in room wifi top rating in 2015 
opt for the premier room where you get free wifi and breakfast and the rate offered is considered value for 
room 's decor is simple but clean and functional 
the afternoon tea average and the evening canap s solid 
do n't bother taking heavy luggage through the streets from the mtr station to the hotel 
and some drunken guests returning from a big night out around 4am made sure we were awake again 
a complimentary afternoon tea 
the hotel is a little old fashioned 
ground floor is for entrance & left luggage 
very nice city hotel with an excellent restaurant and roof top bar 
this is a good convenient hotel for staying in hong kong 
the roof top bar gives a great view of the city but it 's a bit steep in price 
the only good point are the friendly staff and location 
we had a one bedroom suite which included a very good breakfast and access to the lounge on the 19 
great pool and very good staff 
it 's very convenient for bars 
the bath room was super big and the shower was functioned also as a steam room 
the staff are friendly and helpful 
luxury room really not luxury - disappointing lounge 
great hotel . 
taxis available at the doorsteps 
cold service 
there was a real bath in the bathroom which my wife liked and the suite had a small second bathroom 
curtains needed to be drawn at all times for privacy if you 're in the room 
wide variety and very nice setting and lovely food 
but went next door to the great peace square or peace2 coffee house which does really good coffee and 
tried the pool and the gym this year and found them both great 
lovated at top floor with great views but the equipment is not adequate to fully exercise and i mean 
stayed at this hotel for 2 nights 
and allowed us easy access to other parts of kowloon 
the hotel staff was fairly friendly and was always available to help or answer questions and all spoke english 
with a big mall beside and mtr just below the mall 
00 hrs and that i would be charged an extra 1 2 day rate for the 4 hour extension 
the check-in is quick and efficient and the staff are generally very helpful 
online reviews and maps of the location 
we had booked to eat at vertigo on our last night but the prices were really expensive so we 
there are other better options 
little points of difference ( like the book mark from the pool attendant 
the main lobby floor of the hotel felt a bit frenetic 
the pool was adequate 
large bathroom and full kitchen sitting room 
long street in what appeared to be a business district with many luxury hotels and skyscrapers 
stayed here about 15 years ago so when re-visited hk checked the other hotels and 
we again opted for a club room ( ample size but not spacious 
we stayed for three nights in a one bedroom suite ( family with two very young kids and had a 
clean rooms and friendly staff 
we moved here after staying at the pathumwan princess for 3 days , which had smelly 
the suite was spacious and an excellent bathroom with walk-in rain shower and very cool and large raised 
better located hotels in the area 
the breakfast buffet was delicious and catered to western and eastern appetites 
very good for the restaurants and exceptional for the top bar and restaurant 
had we realised that we would be staring straight into someones apartment opposite 
the lobby isnt much to look at but once you get inside you will find the suites very clean 
hotel staff are friendly 
the small pool on the side of this high rising building is accessible via spa reception and is unfortunately half 
a pricey hotel and will only recommend for a business trip and if you need stay in the city 
this hotel is the safest and cleanest bet in dar and should only be used as a resting 
with good drop off facility to downtown and airport 
bathrooms are large 
the hotel manager was so helpful when i complained about the bed the first morning and brought in a new 
this hotel provide free shuttle to and from airportlocated near mrt station 
excellent breakfast and restaurant food 
some nice shops at the hotel and an atm machine in the lobby 
away from city but good hotel to stay 
the choice of restaurants exist and one can have wider choice of food 
we ate dinner at the oriental restaurant--very good dim sum 
you can always take the free shuttle that departs frequently throughout the day 
had great photo opportunities with disney characters but suggest visiting other disney outlets first before visiting disney 
the charge by hourly-basis cheapens the hotel image 
i am a hilton honors members and took the upgrade to a deluxe suite on the 6th 
it was nice but the room we got was average yey comfortable as we got it through priceline 
pretty cool hotel in a great location on wilshire blvd 
it is a great place to stay for a stopover or if you are visting disneyland 
location is easy walk to many restaurants and shopping areas and is a 39 uber ride during high peak times 
we got our things together and headed to the front desk an hour later 
one of the finest hotels and ritz carlton 's 
the restaurants are also very good if also very expensive 9 people in the italian for dinner with a 
nice size and the rate was n't half bad 
staff is superb and rooms are enormous 
excellent beds etc 
room had nice balcony with outstanding views 
two of the 3 restaurants are excellent - midori ( japanese ) be warned 
a fabulous pool and lovely rooms you cant go wrong 
we loved the buildings and the gardens 
connected to the mtr station is a big outlet mall with a food court 
the hotel reception staff were very efficient and friendly 
the facilities are great and the services of staffs are perfect 
we had a room that faced the river ( small balcony ) and the pool 
the check-in process was very quick and the staff was very gracious 
room with balcony was nice and fine 
the reason i did not give full mark for this hotel is the high price 
the pool service was friendly and efficient but we found the drinks pricey for what they were 
the important part is the quality of the hotel and with that one ca n't complain 
truly a beautiful view of water and setting sun with the disney harbor and lighthouse in sight 
chaos reigned . 
travel by myself and get assigned great rooms 
i stayed in a standard double room on a high floor with a great view of the city 
the buffet breakfast was pricey and allocated to 1 
the pool , trader vic 's lounge , menu and drinks just fabulous . 
or a free shuttle car can take you within a 1 
free open internet access was great 
cozy room with 2 very comfortable queen size beds 
they also have a lovely outdoor pool and easy access to parking 
it was a dramatic moment when the drapes opened to reveal the spectacular view of the city 
being able to access the kingdom club lounge and check in in such pleasant surroundings was a relief and 
dotonbori and shinsaibashi are within easy walking distance 
you have to use north exit on the first floor and look to your right 
again we had twin beds and they were comfortable 
the bathroom was spacious 
the staff helpful and friendly and it was well located for beverly hills and transport links to the 
the level lounge was also a pleasant area in which to enjoy a drink and a snack after a day 
the breakfast buffet is amazing and rooms are georgeous 
i have stayed in better hotels and the very poor sleep quality and high noise levels really took away from 
our room was quite spacious with a very comfortable bed 
- both indoor and outdoor pools are heated- beautifully manicured gardens with peaceful seaview for some 
we stayed one night in the kingdom club room 
we would stay elsewhere on our next madrid visit 
we loved the layout and old fashioned atmosphere of the hotel 
i lost my camera in the check-in mess and the front desk manager 
the hotel 's restaurant is good 
restaurants were average but you could get good food at disneyland 
one visit sufficient 
great free wireless access and rapid check-in check-out 
the accessibility to the park was very good with buses going back and forward every 10 or 15 minutes 
but luggage fit with room to walk around with out squeezing 
this hotel seems really nice 
there is a new shopping mall across the hotel ( zhongshan mall ) which was recently 
there was a lot of construction going on outside the hotel ( this was on a sunday ) which 
the room was average and the stay forgettable 
the hotel runs a scheduled free shuttle to the station but it is advisable that you pre-book as 
one of the best ibis i stayed 
lowfood quality 
the only thing i was slightly disappointed with is that the room i stayed in did not have free internet 
really fantastic-- we wanted to leave the curtains open all night so that we could enjoy it 
this is one of the better hotels in this area 
the janakpuri metro station is adjacent to the hotel making it easiest to approach 
since our last visit the guest rooms have been undergoing extensive upgrades 
and the salisbury has got to be one of the best bargains in this city 
gym and a huge outdoor pool 
try and get a room with the water view and hk 5 laundry tokens can be obtained from the 
rooms are very clean and modern 
robes and slippers and all the other amenities one would expect from a 5-star hotel 
eggs were charged extra though 
the reason i did not give this property an excellent rating is because although the hotel is new and the 
i was also discouraged by the high price of using wifi 
the conference facilities are n't great as well and when the doors to the outside are open 
front desk staff were professional 
spent a great five nights here 
the rooms are fine ( including the bathrooms ) 
- nice gym and swimming pool ( opened for public access as well ) 
with excellent and relaxed service and the restaurants are definitely worth visiting at least once 
adequate basic accommodation 
cot provided free of charge for our baby and it was in the room when we arrived 
and bathroom huge 
of good quality and large variety 
short walk to mtr 
we 'd return when next in the area 
separate walk in shower 
for my money ( and i was on a breakfast inclusive package ) room service was better 
the room service menu is one of the most expensive i have ever seen - 12 
everything in the last 2 reviews ( and all of the others ) could not have said it better 
so it was most convenient to check out and walk over to check in for my flight the next morning 
access to the mtr is diagonally opposite the entrance 
this is great value for money 
we were able to walk to most of the restaurants on our list as well as the tourist destinations 
the waiter was very apologetic and did provide a takeaway bag with water and fruit in it to am 
excellent service and warm treatment 
the four seasons group of hotels is a favourite 
more than an airport hotel 
my preferred hotel to stay during my frequent visits to san francisco 
food at the restaurant and room service was excellent 
what i felt was a nice touch are the free apples in the gym and at the front desk 
the only redeeming feature for this alleged five star property is its very central location 
charged me higher room rate than agreed 
convenient location near the airport terminal and the train station 
the have coin-operated computers in the lobby from which you can print your boarding pass 
but on the second trip we sailed from a different terminal and had to take a short cab ride to 
if you have to stay at the airport this is only option i have found that is convenient and comfortable 
coffee shop etc - great for business meetings 
i 'd asked to borrow a kettle which is fine and great for making tea but with it comes 
great beds 
pool view - first floor 
service is very efficient and the food was very good 
the impression of this property is very good 
decent facilities 
a wonderful big pool 
great staff 
nice pool and food 
the floor is very sticky and feel dirty 
very easy walking or tube trip to most of the major shopping centres in london and my wife loved 
breakfast was awesome and the seating for breakfast was a glass walled corner place from where u could 
modern with a great shower 
our friends were in the new building which is lovely but on a winter 's night you would be 
food variety is average but due to the crowd so choices can run out easily 
2am but were in our room quickly 
executive floor brings a nice lounge benefit and does not costt all that much more 
the hotel is very dated amenities are broken it urgently needs heavy maintainence and upgradation 
the lounge bar a bit expensive for snacks 
ancient tv with very poor reception on most channels 
shower was barely large enough to turn around in 
self parking is a bit of a hike 
and the main bar as well 
but the service is good and most importantly it is safe here 
breakfast is pretty average with limited options for vegetarians 
but if i were visiting kona again i might try a different resort next time 
the best things about the ic are the restaurants and the friendly service 
with access only on one side 
when will hotels realize that their ridiculous resort fee just angers the guests 
we got a signed card and a free cocktail each to say congratulations on our wedding ( very nice touch 
25 min south of airport 
perfect shower and bathroom - what more could you ask 
the pool area was also nice 
breakfast at the main restaurant was pretty expensive and buffet only and not for us but they did have 
although they do offer a drink at the bar and quite a nice breakfast 
i spoke the hotel manager about it a couple of times and she had people in to fix both the 
great atmosphere in the bar for drinks prior to going out and the breakfast in le balcon was outstanding

very high prices for very average hotel 
there 's a great bar on site as well that has 
the hotel location is excellent for most purposes 
we were treated like royalty whether we were dressed for an evening on the town or shorts and t- 
this is a top hotel - very highly recommended 
one of the least expensive lux hotels in town 
hotel is in walking distance from most of the downtown historic sights 
claridg'es enjoys a wonderful location - the closest deluxe hotel to 
rooms facing the inner courtyards seem to have exterior machinery noise - you 'll have to keep 
you have to be ready to pay the price for this high quality 
and given the price and the overall performance 
internet access - wired and wireless - is available in all rooms 
no noisy traffic zooming past at night 
the check-in process was seamless and quick and the staff very accommodating of my rushed schedule 
carpets were very clean 
great location with superb and friendly staff 
the main floor 
all the positive reviews are true - this is an amazing find in a large 
i 'd been waiting to stay in claridges for some time after reading about the history of the 
telephone shower only 
service is nothing great . 
be careful of the hotel rates - i was checking these rates for 3 weeks before arrival on the internet 
the right level of luxury 
poor hotel in our opinion . 
and the outside pool was decent depth 
second stay at this hotel and cant recommend it enough 
definitely recommended . 
gym and pool were small 
a very special stay over nye 
both stations will bring you to these places alright 
we had 2 double beds 
bed comfortable and sleep quality good 
this hotel met my every expectation and all staff were totally professional and extremely helpful in every respect 
a leisurely 10-15 minute walk to the waterfront precint and plenty of dining options and bars 
this is an older hotel and quite good but not special 
it 's in a great part of town 
great hotel and service for hyatt gold passport 
which is a hefty mark-up on even the touristy restaurants around the corner 
room has basically everything except there is no mini fridge 
good place to stay if you have business in the andheri east 
small bathrooms not well cleaned 
not the best location 
i would definetely return to renaissance for my next trip to mumbai 
i was here for a conference for two days and the rooms are very clean i liked it the staff 
a good gym 
small but lovely pool with lots of sun lounges 
checkout was as easy as check in and the hotel car service was a good way to end my 
the hotel is relatively close to the airport 
the front desk could n't find reservations for two of them although we were all ultimately accommodated 
the a la carte menu is limited and slow 
such a lovely spread 
we had a room with a small lounge seating area which was great when staying for a week 
i only used the bar and the o2 restuarant 
we had a very large double room with a walk-in closet 
large midtown hotel the hyatt is just steps from grand central terminal and convenient to broadway theat 
this is a great business hotel to stay at 
the setting is really pleasant and the facilities pretty good 
i think on sundays there is more crowd and they are short staff as the service was a bit 
the large room had a spectacular view but that where it all ended 
for the pristine location 
extremely courteous staff and very friendly service 
horrible service partially inexistant with inexperienced staff felt like being in a cheap hotel chain where you do 
new york hotels are expensive 
pool is great 
electric plugs are next to the bed and to the desk 
comfortable bed but very hard pillows ) 
the breakfast buffet is high quality with many indian and western choices 
great location but expensive for what you get 
good size and good size 
clean rooms 
with a nice lobby and decent rooms 
city center and the canal 
close to domestic airport and not too far from the international terminal either 
i had an extremely pleasant stay at the tridant 
avoid the third floor 
but very friendly service 
right now i am trying to reach somebody at the front desk 
i am quite happy staying here but during this stay 
better value than some hotels closer to the hofburg 
stayed at this hotel in later october 2013 
i thought the 24 hour market shop on the lobby level was neat but the prices were just silly compares 
be sure to get a room with an open view 
but tiny bathrooms 
bathroom and amenities are top notch quality and luxurious 
comfortable and good location 
nice touch with everything i am also a gym junkie and enjoy working out on level 3 
she told us for a kind of compensation that we could access the lounge for free but it was our 
we stayed for a short break and chose this hotel due to our hh diamond membership and the ta 
the team at the concierge is a total opposite of the front desk staff 
but for example a bathroom with a walk in shower ( anyway i really do not get the point of 
worst part was that the rooms are very average and noisy 
the hotel is in an ideal location literally next door to grand central station and a few steps away from 
bathroom was luxurious in size 
service was excellent and only the people behind the reception show a lesser interest in their guests than all other 
the hotel lobby is very grandiose 
the staff were very friendly and helpful 
the staff had a little trouble giving me the benefits of the voyager status but it was quickly resolved 
this will not be my first choice for my next visit to vienna 
the executive lounge is a good place to finish the day before heading out to find dinner 
arriving late on friday night - first issue no one to help with luggage or luggage carts 
toilet flush gets jammed 
room was spacious with a great view 
the bathroom spacious and spotless 
the bar is quiet and prices are reasonnable 
comfy bed and large bathroom with separate shower and bath highly appreciated 
their breakfast is sensational and the breakfast staff very friendly

hotel is very closely located to the the rainbow road and old town 
excellent facilities & superb breakfast

greeted with a warm welcome even late arrivals 
the short covered walkway to mgm hotel casino 
breakfast buffet had a variety of choices 
super king bed 
pay the extra for access to the executive lounge on the 45th floor where the terrace allows you 
our room was on the 37th floor penthouse level with extra high ceilings 
the signature comprises 3 separate but connected towers each with its own reception and pool ( you can also use 
if you go for a room here make sure it has a balcony and if you are in tower 1 
though the long walk was in air-conditioned comfort and sometimes even with the ease of travell 
it has a fantastic gym spa pool if you have time also 
amazing large rooms & bathroom fantastic huge gym beautiful spa area and amazing service all around 
go to a different spa if you can 
i consider that four seasons has the best hotel pool in hong kong - view 
location is good on shk zayed road and is in between financial centre and emirates towers 
from the airport it is a short cab ride or you can take the metro to the financial center stop 
the hotel has some great restaurants including caprice 
which is great if you want to keep drinks and prepare small snacks 
great room but service very unequal 
the concierge also helped me in arranging transport and attractions i would like to see in macau 
the jacuzzi was great for relaxing after a busy day 
then the staff at reception were so professional and friendly that they made you feel that you were special 
the service at the reception desk and the valet parking was excellent 
the room was very spacious with a good size bathroom which had a separate shower 
i certainly did n't think it was worth paying double what is already one of the highest prices in 
truly the absolute best location 
fast internet connection with no password and no limit of devices 
vanity obligatory high tech toilet and plenty of storage space and a nice selection of toiletries including a 
great , will go there again .

cross hotel is really a convenient location 
the housekeeping staff are fantastic - brilliant job of keeping clean 
the lobby and rooms were nicely decorated 
i was most impressed with the 1 bedroom apartment i had and the rate was exceptional and less than many 
beautiful and awesome resort 
the pool area is excellent and overlooks the beach 
we also used the limo transfer back to the airport as we had a late flight to paris 
and the food just superb 
the pool is excellent 
given the high colombo temperatures 
the wi-fi internet was reliable in terms of speed and connection compared to most places in the region 
the room is spacious and comfy 
the food at the restaurant was lovely although not the best we 'd had and it was quite a 
good for travellers as well as yas island events 
great hotels like fine wine get better with time and the four seasons is definitely ageing well 
but what let 'some' of it down was that it came to the table lukewarm which 
the bathroom was thoughtfully equipped with the amenities you would find at home 
room was simple but clean and the bed was pretty comfortable 
great small boutique hotel in colombo 
excellent for the business traveller and then vacationer looking for the usual comforts of home 
but decided to stay at the airport due to our flight getting in late and the limited transport options available 
but the four seasons offers brilliant level of service right by the business district 
great spa experience and wonderful views of the bay 
spacious bathroom 
the rooms are old - reminds me of a sheraton 30 years ago 
it 's still an old property 
almost perfect business hotel 
a more then pleasant suite 
this place is a very upscale property to base at and or come home to at the end of a 
what stood out about the st regis princeville was the absolute genuine friendliness of all the staff 
it is very close to old town and the train station 
there 's lots of stunning art deco decoration at the imperial 
but i also noticed the normal toiletries like the toothbrush etc were very good quality ( which was 
dark pattered carpets 
this property is very much in the style of california mission and has a very fine 
but overall a nice place 
this property is very dated and has not been renovated since it opened in 2005 
we thoroughly enjoyed a long walk in the rain through the woods and around the tea plantations breathing in the 
the rooms are spacious and well done 
the bathrooms are beautiful and the products are amazing 
additionally it had a good sized balcony which looked down into the valley and gave a good opportunity to 
great staff with great restaurant menu and above all very clean 
tea and cardigan plantations makes entire area very attractive to explore 
we had drinks at the blue bar and lunch at the chinese restaurant and the lunch experience was fantastic 
high floor away from elevatot 
room very nice and big on 9th floor with good view on the city 
infinity pools and the ocean with a purity of aesthetic scale 
we spent time in both areas and never had a problem with obtaining loungers 
on one occasion i tried ordering a drink from a guest in black shorts and a gray short sleeved 
had a four day stay with my daughter and we had the most magnificent time the rooms the service and 
back side of hotel 
modern design that just flows and draws your eye to the palm trees and sparkling water 
arrived at airport rang hotel asked what time the the bus to hotel would arrive was told 10 minutes 
great pool with harbour view and excellent restaurants in the building 
beach is beautiful and plenty of restaurant options if you want to arrive and not leave for a week 
all nice size with good views 
the service is impeccable and we had full access to the facilities of the hotel 
we got an extra rollaway for our son as there were four of us occupying the room as a 
it also has a connection from the ifc mall to the ferry stations to get you to other parts 
perhaps i arrived when everyone was on their break jonce my things were finally collected ( they sat outside 
thus you feel that the service and the staff are more impersonal 
the concierge was extremely helpful 
food and drinks delicious but pricey 
well equipped with lots of free weights and machines 
beautifully appointed space and excellent service 
great public spaces 
the prices were now really up there and the resort is still tired 
we have stayed at many other high end hotels and the f 
national newspapers available near reception including daily mirror www 
after this we frequented some excellent ayurvedic centres which were much better value 
the beach is amazing private and the drinks are the best 
the service is as you 'd expect and this mature resort has every bug ironed out and everything 
it is conveniently located by the international airport in columbo and they will send a car to pick you 
the hotel has two outdoor swimming pools with great view of the skyscrapers and kowloon 
had an excellent stay 
the oldest luxury resort in broome remains a great place for a luxury getaway . 
and with a great personal touch 
the front desk are quite good 
what a fantastic resort nestled in its own private part the island 
i enjoyed a 45min spa massage treatment and our dinners at the resort were all very nice albeit on 
high on the hill we had one of the best tables and then someone lights up a cigar 
the manicured gardens were impressive and we were positively surprised by the beach that was very beautiful and the 
easy access to anywhere from marlybone station next door 
cafe 58 is pleasant and opens onto small reception 
the restaurants excellent and the location right by such a fantastic beach delightful 
on arrival we were given a glass of champagne and then checked in 
the small pool etc however all i can say was that my parents and i were more than happy with 
there is no bath only a shower and the bathroom is a little on the small side for my liking 
the property feels like bits and pieces have been added with no real design or plan 
but the the rooms are quite spacious and very comfortable 
ca n't get closer to the beach 
the building could be nicer ( a bit too much concrete and hospital-lighting in the main dining room 
the silk brasserie has quite a basic menu 
initially i was told to wait one hour only 
the staff at the function could be trained better but overall a very enjoyable stay 
clean beach with warm water 
ferry from singapore is a plus 
better options elsewhere 
the gym looks excellent ( did n't go in 
a nice turndown service 
most activities have a minimum age of 4 and the main pool was too deep for my son as well 
facility is great although it would benefit from a serious refurbishing - some ac leakages from the 
club rooms are ok and although they have nicely decorated bathrooms they feature a very tiny desk - definitely not 
westcliff and monte casino are all very nice hotels but michelangelo still beats them for 
but it was spotlessly clean and the bathroom had all the toiletries you would need 
it 's a short walk to lot 10 where there is a good choice of nightlife 
the hotel staff were very hospitable and the hotel also arranges interesting tours with certified guides to different 
15th floor houses a large landscaped pool with bbq areas and spectacular night views of k 
although the service was good 
the price here was one of the more affordable one in manhattan 
in room internet was nicely complimentary 
it was just a great courtesy . 
beautiful huge pool 
great location and hip rooms 
and breakfast had a nice selection of local specialities 
a nice 10 minute walk to kabatas tram station which can take you to the 
it was one of the more expensive hotels but this was our first visit to vietnam we and 
great bathrooms 
one of the few hotels in london where after a long flight from ny 
the staff are very helpful and the service is of a high standard 
but it just lacked the little touches that really make it a five star 
and friendly staff 
easily accessible from a number of tubes and restaurants and supermarkets on the doorstep 
the hotel has a glamorous entrance and the restaraunt was excellent 
nice gym 
the location is perfect if you have business & pleasure at south manhattan 
the major attractions are nearby 
i think the hotel does a good job of making sure guests feel comfortable 
but seems to be stuck in a very dark area at night with virtually nothing immediately around it 
it one of the best hotels in istanbul 
breakfast buffet is wonderful with great selection from vietnamese pho 
club lounge is large 
i was happy with the lounge vibe 
but price is very competitive 
the staff is extremely nice but the property is just regular and the cost seemed high to me ( 400 
front desk very helpful on how to get about 
there are several shops and restaurants within walking distance 
its not a huge hotels 
so if you like modern hotels 
i would rate 5 star for the location of this hotel as it is near to the subway station - 
why would someone stand behind the check-in desk if they were n't going to check people in 
the guest rooms are well appointed and the bathrooms are spacious 
room was very small ( as you 'd expect in manhattan ) but well set up and very 
convenience and spacey clean room 
i usually stay at the w hotel on lexington 
this small luxury hotel offers nice accomodation and interesting packages 
it can be a good value depending on your travel dates 
verrry nice hotel 
and good value 
a good hotel with a fantastic outdoor pool and scenic desk overlooking petra and the vast roughed 
i wish there were more hotels like this 
everything here is absolutely spotless and the rooms with the sea views and balcony 's are a must 
front desk staff and the chambermaids are more consistent 
gym and rooms at the waldorf are equal or better and there are more transportation options from 
being a small hotel as a definite advantage in that there are fewer guests and it feels more like a 
clean toilets 
enormous bathroom with amazing closet 
the bed was very comfortable and the amenities were top notch 
the hotel has a perfect location and booking via amex centurion meant i got an upgrade to a 
the bathroom was also spacious 
pool fireworks view is much nicer than the parking lot but you pay for it 
if staying longer i would book a room with a view either towards nice or the sea 
the front desk was very courteous 
double sinks and a large separate shower cubicle 
while the lanson place lacked some of the refined luxury of other great hotels in hong kong 
maximising the full area 
there on the top floors 
rooms come with a small kitchenette and snacks drinks and are better for singles couples due to the semi 
low cost public bikes - free for 1st half hour 
very good location 
one day he forgot to put new towels 
the bed is firm and there is a pillow menu which allowed me to get a latex pillow which i 
the cost is not exhorbitant but a nice touch would have been to supply this complimentary 
thanks to blinds that covered the windows perfectly 
the bedroom itself was spacious and well appointed with bright colours 
business users beware - wifi was 30 euros for 24 hours and activex and java is blocked ( for 
large bathroom with seperate shower 
we had their ginger tea and decided to share scones and their club sandwich 
although very central this hotel is extremely quiet making for a good nights sleep 
free apples are available at the front desk and tuesdays are free massage days ( register at the 
spend 100 pesos on a ( motorized ) tricycle and get a pedicure nearby 
compared to the poor quality of resorts in boracay 
cold towels and fruit popsicles for arriving guests 
the hotel lobby is beautiful and a nice place to have a drink when travelling alone 
the hotel is really quiet and relaxing 
from greeting us on arrival ( the concierge staff team is excellent 
late review from junethis is an objective review based on a 5 week touring holiday 
pros- spacious and elegantly designed rooms with kitchenette- smartphone for free local calls and long 
but for a true luxury hotel this is my top choice in toronto 
the welcome basket of goodies of cookies and juices was a lovely gesture 
this was very good visit 
room was very comfortable and of a good size 
it is hands down one of the better hotels i have stayed in hk 
central station less than 10 minutes walk 
higher floor better 
last year our room was very large and had good views over the street outside 
but a trip across the street to any of a number of coffee shops nearby is an easy alternative 
it was so helpful for tourists like us 
staff has to make u feel welcome 
this is also a very wired hotel good connectivity 
location is overall good though as walking distance to lee gardens and times square 
not just an extra bed next to mommy and daddy 
modern new 4 star resort which can be 5 star with staff with better english speaking skills 
as a spire member i was treated like royalty 
everything from beginning to end was excellent and all the staff members were friendly and helpful 
3 sets of happy hours at very reasonable prices 
there are no sleazy girly bars as in other parts of samui 
everyone from the front desk 
the spa was fantastic and the kids club is the best i 've seen at a hotel 
great location if you have an early flight 
parking is free -- get a ticket from the front desk to enter exit the gates 
one of the best london hotels 
95 for a small flute of house champers is not for the faint hearted ! 
all complementary mini bar including all organic juice 
a little old but the rate including breakfast was well worth it 
hotel is located near to main city center and easy accessible to main shopping and restaurants in the city 
soft drinks 
- dinner in the restaurant was great 
the bathroom had excellent amenities with a heated towel rack and a good size bath 
modern decor 
take the higher floors 
free shuttle every 30 mins to mandela sq 
the suite was spacious 
bathrooms are fully equipped 
this place is very trendy the staff are all young and a bit to casual for my likingthe rooms 
several modern suited 
there are no commercial centers nearby and you had to take a kung walk to the nearest restaurants 
an example of good up keeping if possible , improving the selections of breakfast to suit foreigners' taste would 
great gym 
close to the klcc and twin towers and the rooms are comfortable 
we loved the nice touches at the lobby like apples 
excellent location next to liverpool street station 
was given a fantastic suite on arrival 
great meal especially the venison steak and super service in getting the australian men 's tennis 
the minibar has complimentary soft drinks 
( separate bath and shower ) everything seemed to work and lights easy to operate ( nice when you get 
with a clean bathroom 
rooms are very big and spacious 
nice bedding so we slept well 
30pm rooms are big clean rooms gym is good but dated no swimming pool room service is good everything 
rooms were good and spacious but again there can be more work put into them 
you get a spacious lounge are with sofa and tv 
given that it is very close to the financial district ) 
we met and or exceed all health and hygiene requirements and take extreme pride and care in providing the best 
the room was spacious 
either thicker curtains or new sound insulated windows should be considered at the next refurbishment 
a proper shower and a really good flexible bedside light 
large and clean room 
this style of tripling the prices when is a celebration ( same was for valentine day 
the only downside - and in reality it 's not technically a downside - but the decor is in 
its at the doorstep of ampang mrt station which brings you to sentral within 15 min and 
stayed here recently as part of a nearby conference 
good restaurants 
the liverpool street tube station is right next to the property 
the bed was comfortable and the entire room had a welcoming feel 
fast wifi ( free to 1g daily ) access to public transport 
the staff was amazing and made us feel extremely welcome 
fast free wifi 
the staff is generally polite but not the most efficient or fast 
there is a sad mall opposite the hotel 
great location and good service 
our suite was fantastic with giants windows overlooking the water and old town 
we had a quiet rear facing 'medium' room on a high floor which was perfect given the 
go for the highest floors 
the breakfast was okay 
excellent location 
walking distance less than 300m to harbour city and food eateries are everywhere within walking distance 
first trip was great 
i enjoyed the higher floor 
can take the complimentary hotel shuttle at the interval of every hour till 8pm 
the business lounge is great with a wide variety of free drinks and different snacks and is well staffed with 
we received a complimentary upgrade to a sea view property and broadly it was good 
either book the most expensive option with either a butler or concierge or better yet go to 
there is a free shuttle to and from the kowloon station to the hotel 
the breakfast is not bad n the service staff is friendly 
which is regarded as one of the best beaches on the island 
the location is very good and i have no complaints about the staff 
bathroom is big enough with separate bath and shower 
not bad for stays with kids either 
but the bed was very comfortable 
the location of the hotel us very central with all main attractions close by 
only thing thats going for this hotel is its location 
convenient location and good view of railway station 
i expect more from an interconthe real downfall for this hotel is its restaurants 
all the main attractions were within walking distance 
the lobby is spacious 
and then were taken through a back glass automatic door to a parking lot with rooms that looked like a 
you will find there are many local restaurants and shopping malls nearby 
the lobby is amazing 
it still provides good transportation for a great stay 
this was my first visit to budapest 
and also great was the cigar bar staff who always knew my drink or preferred wine 
they included some local delicacies and the vietname pancake was delicious 
but very odd decor 
booked the airport transfer which was more expensive than a regular taxi but good and hassle free 
you have to get your drinks yourself and make your own tea from tea bags 
good value 
most convenient location ever 
the shower in the room had decent water pressure but seemed incapable of getting to a temperature beyond tep 
i paid just under a 100 per night which i think was a great price for a nice hotel in 
the rooms are immaculately maintained and have all comfort that you expect at this price point 
no lobby seating area but staffs were quite efficient 
no funny smells at all 
hotel guests face the possibility that the fire would likely spread to the hotel 's escape route 
good shower 
luckily there are many restaurants connected next door 
ashkar saw us and signaled to wait one minute 
the room looked into the building in front so you had to keep the curtains shut at all times 
good modern hotel in good location but limited facilities 
i would like to make special comment to the suite room which is always kept clean and comfortable by the 
a beautiful starbucks branch and a convenience store are located just outside the lobby 
the amenities are excellent 
i had to ask the front desk for that to happen after 5 days 
a bit pricey given the size of the room but its location is worth it 
- pool and gym looked great but did not use- no in-room mini-bar- review 
in room microwave and mini fridge at a very reasonable price and a very friendly staff 
our room was a nice size and clean 
toilet was very clean 
which was very good and we found out later that we could also use that area for free drinks and 
they offer taxis for your needs 
depending upon the mental traffic the hotel is about 30-60-minute taxi ride from the airport 
i would recommend it but do have to tollerate a bit of soft noise 
cheap and easy taxi ride to the old town 
the hotel is some 10-15 min walk from the waterfront in a nice area of lima 
the room was clean and adequate in size and the price is good for hong kong kowl 
helpful staff 
we had a late flight and were given a 2pm checkout and they looked after our luggage while we 
hotel lobby facilities are great and look like newly renovated 
near transport and several tourist sites 
bathroom was good and bed comfortable 
a towel cake and card was sent up to our room which was lovely 
i know this hollywood is not the main disney hotel 
so everthing was fantastic frm the reception 
compared with the hotels in japan and other hong kong hotel rooms ) and efficient 
staff & food at most of the restaurants all excellent - staff in general a bit lack-lustre 
small but good apartments in good location 
had heard of the disney touch in their themed hotels worldwide and this one did not disappoint 
more a part of the lobby lounge with poor selection and service 
internet was working correctly and a nearby italian restaurant was good 
huge layout with nice lanscape sea-facing-garden 
it 's truly a business hotel located in the heart of the city close to khalifa energy 
the hotel has a complimentary shuttle that runs between the disneyland hotels and disneyland 
lovely decor and beautiful big rooms 
despite of not having a proper restaurant for breakfast everything is perfect 
kristoff at front desk was excellent 
it would be nice to improve the food quality and housekeeping quality 
i needed to book a week 's accommodation in central and chose the butterfly on wellington based on 
nobody changed the amenities in the bath the second night nor were the linen changed or at least iron 
great eateries and shopping centres 
bed was very comfy so a good night 's sleep and no ear plug needed 
the hotel have a nice swimming pool 
sure disneyland hotel has a few more premium restaurants 
this hotel is cheaper than the other disneyland hotel but it is a good quality hotel 
the staff was friendly 
the room was very comfortable and quiet 
the breakfast decent 
a separate bedroom with plush terry robes 
given both the city and the location in the city 
5-10 mins easy walk to ifc mall and star ferries 
take a shuttle bus and you 'll be at disneyland in 5 minutes 
located right outside the domestic airport and hence automatically has much more advantage than any other hotel 
the location of this property is excellent if you want to explore hk island 
the internet was quite expensive 
unfortunately they were busy and the kitchen could not cope at all 
ask for an upper floor room ( 29 ) 
a colleague and i stayed here three nights on the second stop of a three-city trip 
i was pretty much happy with my stay 
the novotel has a good carpark 
the main pool area has plenty of room but is apparently due to be closed for refurbishment in the 
the bathroom with a large shower compartment 
if this is your first time to this hotel i will advice you to early to the airport for assistance 
n nit took the housekeeping 2 days to clear my used glasses &amp 
beer and soft drinks with an impressive selection of hot snacks between 5pm and 7pm 
the breakfast room is a giant cantine 
i used the hotel limo to get back to the airport and it only cost nother aud 10 
the views from the lounge are amazing beer and snacks all day is great for 3 aussie blokes 
the bed was fantastic 
beautiful swimming pool . 
the pool is nice 
the stay was pleasant enough 
good value also ( although maybe not for krakow ) 
this was a great base for visiting sigirya rock 
breakfast buffet has everything you want 
our room was on the 3rd floor which was a large room with a door to a balcony and 
excellent front desk staff and breakfast service 
staff at check in were very efficient- the gym was functional ( bit more than basic 
the rooms are absolutely great in terms of their design 
the clarion ended up being an excellent choice as it allowed me to get to a bed very quickly 
it has also nice restaurants and an amazing bar with seating outside in lovely weather specially on may 
we had to request an extra bed and were only provided with two glasses 
a wide selection of options and all very good quality 
free shuttle service to lsland east & central & airport express station are very good 
very good gym 
for a quick drop in drop out with easy access and no fuss 
comfortable bed and nice onsen on the ground floor 
we went out nearby the resort area and they have many choices for japanese food and taste good 
higher floor harbour view rooms are better quality and have the best views 
this is helpful for non japanese guests 
so if you wnat to see hong kong i recommend staying closer to central or over in 
there are many choices of restaurants and cafes very close to the hotel and we chose to stroll in the 
the buffet breakfast was amazing with a very extensive choice of food 
the distance between the nearby down town and hotel will take you 20 30min driving 
well maintained room 
historic hotel on the bay 
and i enjoyed the selection of outlets available 
the outside security and bell staff were very efficient and hailed us a taxi quickly 
the coffee shop is always good 
spectacular- one of the best hotels in the world 
wi-fi and breakfast included 
what a beautiful property 
front desk staff are very friendly and efficient 
the lounge area was comfortable 
although the outdoor jacuzzi seems pretty nice 
the glass facades and the lobby on the 5th level 
the hotel has an outdoor swimming pool 
request for a room with the harbour view and on the higher floors 
check in was a breeze and led directly to my massive suite and shown round properly 
in the bar at the top of the hotel probably you can enjoy with one of the better views of 
the hotel car took us to the ambience mall nearby and this was a really good service 
and have to say the club lounge here is excellent 
bathroom open plan ( partitioned by clear glass into bedroom ) with a clever sit in bath and 
that does not in any way detract from the beautiful layout and cleanliness of the hotel 
it 's the best hotel i 've stayed at in india 
lovely grand entrance to the hotel -we had a harpist every night as it was de 
it was comfortable and average but nothing more 
stayed on the club floor so checked in on the club level but the room was n't ready 
it also offers a high quality and reliable airport transfer service which is not much more expensive than the equivalent 
as i like light breakfasts bit star bucks and pret a manger are just 1 minute away 
room was decent sized2 ) check in out counter staff are very friendlyminus points1 ) internet is 
the neighborhood is very residential and thus have a good wide choice of local restaurants at very decent prices 
the location is unbeatable 
it has a magnificent lobby covering three floors right next to the harbour with wonderful views across to hong 
walk in type of closet and a very large bathroom with a great shower 
it was beautifully decorated 
we stayed here for three nights ( my second visit ) and honestly ca n't fault the hotel 
i had a room on the 6th floor that had a view overlooking the shops below 
easy access to metro 
both were similarly priced and i generally found the ritz carlton to be superior ( larger 
with wifi being fast and free 
very nice and clean spa 
the pool area is excellent with a fantastic view of the coty from the rooftop and a bar 
so you can be assured of first class service 
house keeping did a fantastic job with the cleaning and turndown service daily 
and westbury are considered the top hotels 
lots of good pubs and restaurants nearby 
i appreciate that it must be very difficult for the chefs to ensure that all the food at these sum 
overall a very good hotel 
bed is comfortable and a great bathroom and lighting 
however i checked that the flexible rate differences were 120 euros between standard to club so 60 euros for 
of the property itself it is an older hotel with somewhat dated decor but still remains stylish and comfortable 
it really is worthwhile booking a club room 
and restaurants via direct subway links and short taxi ride away 
the main hotel staircase is very impressive 
luxurious with excellent service standards 
the spa itself is ok - the massages were good but the mani and pedis not so 
free internet and free access to the lounge on the 58 floor ) 
the staff in the lounge were very nice and professional 
this is simply a great hotel 
it serves three small meals a day 
great amenities 
granted there is a nice mall right beneath the hotel 
love the convenience of having the mall accessible directly from the hotel 
highly recommended for both hotel and the mall 
we used the free shuttle to visit kowloon centre and the driver was excellent 
i did n't walk around the area much but there is a starbuck 's in the hotel 
breakfast had a good spread 
the metro is available at the other end of the mall and the hotel is at the opp end 
the lounge at the top of the hotel serves a nice breakfast and the evening snacks and drinks are also 
- nice toiletries and they were very generous with these 
they provided one large square pillow as well as a memory form pillow 
if the weather would be god you could see this area getting really busy 
i had a few of those in college and they were a 10 special at the bargain bin 
the staff was very courteous and smiled at every opportunity 
good selection of drinks so we skipped dinner after a couple of hours of troughing our way through the 
the views of the harbour were stunning though the location was not ideal however they have a very efficient shuttle 
perfect location as just out of the hustle and bustle but everywhere easily reached within minutes 
the hotel staff were very friendly 
hotel is located really near to dubai airport and hotel offered also complimentary hotel shuttle 
downsides were the poor beds 
( note that the reception even first suggested that we stay one night in that room and then get it 
staying on property allows you to maximize not only your time in the parks but the whole disney 
the pool area was nice and a good way to finish off a long day at the theme parks 
sometimes it could be dirty but to be honest it 's the other guests not being clean or clearing 
go to the high floors with a west facing view 
it is in a rougher area of kowloon but that 's what we loved about 
this resort is quite a bit smaller than the upper scaled places but then again it is a lot quieter 
also the windows were dirty on the terrace 
club rooms also include a lounge offering reasonable snacks and evening drinks 
i liked it and will be happy to return and its well within corporate budgets for staff and business people 
staff were efficient in reception and the lounge and were able to help with the location of the nearest ir 
the problem began at check-in as i was checking in someone working for the hotel walked up and 
when the nearby building work is finished the waterside walk down to the ferry and port area will be 
not many hotels in hk are right on the harbour 
what really makes this place great is it 's location 
the rooms are very well appointed and have all the facilities that you need but they are small 
staff were lovely in the lounge 
didnt stay here overnight but was there for a short time during transfer . 
it is a good hotel if you get a reasonable price 
was upgraded to a nice view of san fran 
add some vietnamese appetizers and the guests would enjoy more 
bedroom is well equipped with very modern bathroom 
the room was well appointed but there was minimal space around the bed and the en-suite shower 
the roof top pool was very nice although sometimes service was slow for snacks 
the hotel is located about 5 mins walk from ealing common tube station and the friendly staff helpfully 
a 2pm check out is offered to club guests but this was readily extended to 4pm and guests 
the desk is a very narrow shelf along the wall and so if you seriously wanted to work this would 
the food quality is also very good 
the rooftop pool is a nice place to watch the day end with a cool drink 
if part of your decision for a great hotel is the pool 
19th floor is a non-smoking floor 
do n't go for the upgrade unless you are given a city view 
cool bar and restaurant that has a delicious brunch breakfast 
yes book the club room and snack your way through the day at the club 
lobby is not located at entrance level 
nice property in good location 
we had complimentary champagne delivered to our room with a personal welcome note 
modern and very clean hotel right next to conference centre 
i know ny gets a bad wrap on hotels being pricey with small rooms 
overall an okay stay 
as well as a decent sized fridge in the room 
the mini bar fridge had those annoying sensors for automatic charge - lucky i called soon after my wife moved 
modern and contemporary and the public areas very nice - including the skybar 
they also removed the overhang on top of the bar that contained the tvs 
the staff were friendly and helpful 
and generally friendly reception staff 
with free internet access 
we were in a room on the 4th floor and the room looked quite dirty 
just add 2 dollars for one hour when you need it friendliness and attentiveness level of the staff 
rooms are the same size 
the executive lounge is a nice benefit 
good value 140 exec room inc 
decent location near fisherman 's wharf though there are plenty of other hotels located closer to the 
food at the restaurant is pretty good and the fitness center is spacious and has a variety of cardio equipment 
can be good choice for those interested in eating and shopping 
difficult to believe you are in the middle of a major city 
good rooms and all that you want from a hotel in this location 
easy walking distance to the main transport hubs and close to bus and tram stops 
in the nice neighborhood of jardins 
trendy property well located near shopping and business district 
with modern fixtures and comfortable beds 
the lobby bar is a good place for meetings 
the location of the hotel is excellent for those looking for easy access to the city as it is within 
near a beautiful and safe park in s o paulo 
putting this property at odds with other doubletrees i 've stayed in - it was really 
centrally located and just minutes away from the city 's major tourist attractions 
the front desk and i shared some jokes over this 
) on our pillow one evening also was n't pleasant 
the reception was friendly and welcoming - and our room was ready when we arrived 
imac in every room with free wifi 
hotel is just around the corner from tower hill tube station and the dlr is also close by 
1970s ) dishes on the menu like french onion soup and devilled eggs - kinda quaint but these 
the hotel has a great l iobby 
i will not be looking to stay here again - i think there are much better options in syd 
) and really nice towels 
it had the extra bed in it already completely made up 
we liked the sofitel wentworth on previous visits 
the hotel has a great lobby 
we had a prestige suite for 4 nights in early january 
their last refurbishment was most welcome 
the low points swiftly outweighed our enjoyment of the free cookies 
breakfast was good with wide selection but when it full with guest they have difficulty to take care even 
very comfortable bed and pillows 
clean rooms in good condition 
the lobby is very nice and smells gorgeous 
you are greeted by very friendly front desk staff and the check in was smooth and quick 
the staff are always friendly and accomadating enev keeping the bar open to the early hours 
the location was perfect as far as we were concerned close to the beach and numerous restaurants and within easy 
it s clean but very basic - almost feels like everythings been moved out and just the shell 
check in was quick and noel at the front desk was efficient and friendly 
a shuttle bus is available to the malls and other destinations 
and this is reflected in the poor quality of fittings and furniture in the hotel 
all you need for a short trip to hong kong 
small rooms 
had one tiny window looking onto a solid brick wall 
free shuttle bus ( number 
our trip was probably made more enjoyable due to an upgrade to suite 
if it was priced cheaply i would have not complained but at close to a 40 it was unacceptable 
good service 
my room was quiet with an interior view 
but then there was the inevitable confusion with the rate and non-application of card benefits which is down 
very tastefully decorated 
sleep quality was great and the bed was very comfortable 
the pool is small 
and it is really good value as a spg redemption 
secondly there was poor water pressure and you had to do laps under the shower to get wet 
the bed only came with a doona and so the air condition had to be kept going 
the bathroom was clean and well-finished too and there were plenty of nice touches around the room to 
really nice old style hotel with large rooms with everything you need 
the hotel is well located on the nathan road - so very easy access to jade 
the wifi was free 
rooms are a good size 
the bathroom plug was stuck so i was left with a basin full of shaving foam 
i decided to stay at the radisson as i had an early flight home for christmas 
very friendly and accomodating staff 
this felt like one of the better options amongst heathrow hotels 
there is not much around here on the weekends as it is in a funny side of the city 
their gym had a decent amount of equipment but they were tightly bunched together to give a cramped feel 
do n't hesitate to ask for a quiet room- i have to work so asked and my room 
the mini bar was well stocked but was the variety to instantly charge you when removing an item 
also a reasonable distance from main kowloon station that is one of the few stops on the airport 
what we chose was ok but it seemed that the menu was quite limited unless you wanted posh fast 
the gym and pool are excellent 
i have just returned from 2 pleasant nights stay at this hotel 
its a 5 minute walk down the hill to circular quay 
the bed was super comfortable 
the staff should be applauded for getting customer service so right 
the buffet was excellent we really enjoyed it they had a large variety to choose from 
going to the airport is another story - there 's a hotel hopper bus which charges 4 pounds 
the breakfast buffet was excellent 
better than last visit 
just 5 mins walk to the jade markets and the night markets 
a frequent free bus service to kowloon station ( where bags can be dropped and passengers can get 
about what i would expect for an airport hotel 
and elegant lobby and lounge 
for whatever reason , the sofitel in sydney does not give automatic access to the 
the staff are wonderful and the two restaurants are worth dining at 
one of the best hotels in bsas 
it would have been nicer on the top floor with a view 
to us the king bed is like sleeping on a cloud the room is large modern with a great bathroom 
will certainly be back again . 
the service was excellent and the room was clean and quite large and one of the few with a balcony 
do n't expect to have space to move around- the bed closest to the window experienced some kind 
the staff was friendly and the concierge helped me in making suitable taxi arrangements on shot notice 
though the staff were very friendly 
no restaurants visible in the location 
walking distance to kremlin and red squarefantastic food at the breakfast hall ( an attraction in 
our complain was that some of the pillows had a bad smell ( sweat ) and we have asked 
not much in the way of views unless you are on a high floor 
but mattress was hard and the pillows were awful 
an historic building at such a central location and with such excellent staff is absolutely worth experiencing 
a well kept property close to everything 
unique experience ! 
but rather limited in space 
that provides good quality service in a nice environment 
with transport nearby 
we either had cereal and milk or fruit and there 's a starbucks across the street which opens 
i 'll definitely stay again at the conrad 
the staff spoilt my daughter with cookies and soft toy while my husband and i got great massages 
shower water pressure was good and water was hot 
nor does it have a particularly good beach 
the service friendly if a little slow 
nice stay 
there 's the main pool ( quite large ) 
this is a great hotel 
the hotel was a very big complex and you had to be ready to walk a little bit for everything 
the bed was very comfortable and very good sleep quality 
the suite was very clean and thoroughly turned out twice each day 
the hotel beach offers you complete privacy 
my next stay coming soon 
hotel staff were very friendly with decent service 
the gym is ridiculously small so do n't count on it too much 
i stayed here for work for a couple of nights - great concierge 
stayed 5 nights at the conrad bali and was upgraded due to hhonors status 
nice property but no advantage over other nice resorts 
the seafront restaurant is nice but over priced 
high tea and two hours of cocktails pay for it 
the pool was large and there was a spa 
food quality is also average 
overall good value 
a comfortable bed and a great selection of pillows 
empty promises from the hotel manager and very bad service attitude from the receptionists 
this property is worth a mention 
the pool and beach staff were amazing when ensuring that you had everything you needed and worked extremely hard 
all the earlier reviews have criticised the beach and it 's true that it is far from bali 
efficient reception 
parking is easy to access 
arriving into the bedlam of the ground floor entrance lobby makes you want to turn tail and 
overall great room and hotel that i will return to with no hesitation 
this is a beautiful property 
and parking outside the hotel ( you have to pay for parking separately 
the toilet is also big 
you can catch free hotel shuttle from airport express hong kong station 
sea water was as hot as a bath when we visited 
small suffocating rooms that very not clean or comfortable 
perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature 
when offered free drinks on the 1st evening they did not have my wife 's favourite drink 
as a platinum member of starwood i got some goodies , some of the employees were great ( 
the service was excellent and the staff were helpful 
so was the bathroom with shower and separate bath 
you ca n't find better for the price 
noisy and traffic filled road 
he cannot help but wake up the other guest because the door lets out large amounts of light and noise 
the room and facilities are very good 
what a choice and all of the highest quality 
not great for swimming since it is more for activities 
the wifi is spotty and you get no internet from time to time i 
however staff was very nice and friendly and the breakfast was very good 
free parking and helpful staff 
an empty fridge which was good as i stayed at another hi that week which charged you as soon as 
drinks in the bar are top end pricey - 8 for a small beer 
the resort is quite large with direct access the beach 
we received the diamond benefits of complimentary afternoon tea 
cold front desk 
also buses close by to go across town 
at least the meals are warm when they arrive at your table 
the top floor bar is however nice 
which was a nice touch 
too close to other building 
it was next to a mtr station and there is a big shopping mall across the road 
with an illy coffee machine as well as separate customer fridge 
at the end of your stay you hand over an envelope with total tips in and they split this 
the caf on the 1st floor has an interesting concept for breakfast where you chose one main course and 
and ride to the airport is really really quick 
the rooms are fantastic 
everything is open bathroom concept 
the room is very very big and it has a lot of modes of transportation 
the coffee lounge is a nice place to have your breakfast or relax with a cup of coffee 
we stayed only 1 night during a tour of the taj mahal 
but the menu is a bit abbreviated 
about 24 square metres room with a little balcony facing mountbatten east coast road 
the rooms are n't huge but they are clean and comfortable 
perfect service . 
perfect business hotel in great location 
noodle station and the usual assortment of western and asian breakfast 
the welcome at reception was delightful 
the more expensive harbour view rooms at the top of the hotel have great views too 
food ok but not fantastic - very much buffet style but also menu 
less for romantic vacation 
the hotel does provide free shuttle to changi airport 
the manager came and then tried to calm me down 
the gym was located off the lobby instead of at the spa 
but the ceilings are lower than the rooms on the higher floors 
near all facilities and the distance to central is doable and there 's more to hong k 
but enough space around the bed 
swimming pool is outdoor and was fronted on all sides by tall apartment buildings 
there is also a nice foodcourt at lvl 2 
had booked a garden view room and it was a good size and a nice view of the courtyard 
beds are great and so are the blankets in case you forget to put the aircon on 25 
i spend many nights in hotels every year on business 
all for incredibly reasonable prices 
equipped with the best equipment and a decent size swimming pool 
it was a great bathroom with an excellent rainfall showerhead 
great 'cool' hotel by the group who own upper house and opposite house but at much less of 
we were on the 3rd floor and the smell of new paint was very strong in the corridor 
if you do n't have any visitors in your room and only need a room which is close to 
black definitely seems to be the in color in chic spanish hotels these days 
great value for money i have stayed here twice a month for the last 12 months . 
and slide-out work table is nice 
the enitre wall was made of glass and the bath room was huge 
best part was the awesome location 
shower in regular queen bedded rooms works better ( with a glass door ) which means the whole 
the front desk staff was very friendly and let me check in four hours early 
definitely worth staying again 
the higher floors on the side street are quiet 
about 10 mins walk you can reach at eslite book shop 
hotel is in an old building 
bathrooms are marble ( or good imitation ) and very nice and clean 
the service in the vilard restaurant however was slow and not consistent 
beautiful decor 
we thought the price very reasonable 
spitting distance from a subway entrance and easy to catch a cab 
it was a quick walk to the arch and easy access to the interstates 
the lighting system which is a crestron system was strangely programmed ( turning off the desk light also turned 
our room on the 21st floor was exceptionally spacious for manhattan and beautifully furnished in keeping with the 
the gym does n't open until 7am but when you have jet lag and are up in the 
there is a free bus that takes you to the airport you just have to advise the reception what time 
i was travelling with 8 others and this means lost business and we will never return . 
reception very friendly 
if you need to use the concierge desk then give yourself a lot of time 
if you 're happy with a relatively long transfer from to the airport this place delivers all that you 
the free shuttle van between the airport and the radisson runs about twice an hour from early morning to 
bathroom dated and no separate shower 
airport hotel is a broad concept 
very nice pool area and amenities and well appointed suite 
all staff fantastic - fran the door man 
prior to leaving i stopped to have a pot of tea and the young lass who served me 
the staff are helpful and friendly 
also the aircon is noisy both inside and out - if you get a lower floor room at the 
needed a place to sleep off a 12 hour wait for my next flight- found it ! 
french toast 
the hyatt seems to have adopted a bare bones policy and has cut down on services such as free 
lots of eateries close early 
bring all your own toiletries 
the wired internet access is good but forget the wireless - its useless 
the fitness center is located in basement and is relatively small in size - e 
i was thinking about this review and there was really not anything to not like which is a good thing 
the bed and bedding were quite comfortable 
they arranged for a great dinner in fyve downstairs where we were treated to a great meal 
very old furniture very tatty looking and musty 
this is the worst ever hotel i have stayed at in nyc 
rooms are a generous size and staff friendly and efficient 
on another occasion i walked to the front desk to ask about for the wifi password and was once snapped 
nice large bathroom with a bath and rain shower and nice linens and towels 
best thing about the resort was our sunset and day sailing on the shotover catamaran - 
but they were clean and spacious with a good sized bath 
good ambience 
the happy hour from 1700-1800 in the reception area was good - free wine of a reasonable standard 
bedroom is double glazed but bathroom is not 
the location was excellent but the room i had was very small ( although i have yet to stay in 
as is the hotel ( but typical of a type ) but the aircon sounds like a small tractor 
room was ok and i love 1920 style its opposite penn station just a walk and well apart from 
some funky places to eat nearby and shopping and more shopping with macys so close and all the stores 
the hotel itself is new but style over substance is not what i look for in a hotel 
room furniture is a mixture of cheap ( sofa bed ) and solid 
spa is nice and the workout room was big enough 
but the 'best' was when my wife & i were left waiting at the outdoor cafe for service 
vaulted ceilings with big log fires is the evening perfect after a day 's hiking in the 
our biggest complaint 
professional staff 
the restaurants and the food is pretty good 
rooms have very nicely designed toilets but the design of the room entrance needs better sound proofing as my 
the bus is prompt and provides an excellent free service 
this is the best accommodation we have ever experienced in town 
good ( and relatively ) cheap drinks 
two on the first floor 
we could stay only a night at the tenaya lodge in the yosemite national park 
the car park was cluttered but check in was quick and the staff were really helpful 
we were on the 8th floor and the breeze was fantastic 
after a good nights sleep breakfast was very good and much better than our previous stay 
discovery bay is a relaxing place to chill 
the pool is very nice 
access to a pantry to make tea coffee whenever you want 
there are certainly less expensive options in penang 
the bed is comfortably hard but all the pillows are too soft for my liking 
but ice machines are available on certain floors to keep drinks cool 
extra kind front desk 
a quiet pseudo boutique hotel 
we even enjoyed an afternoon at the delightful spa just relaxing and getting massages 
club lounge is small 
check in was a breeze and we were welcomed with refreshing drinks and towels seconds after arriving 
i had a nice corner room on the 13th floor 
comes with free minibar and balcony 
hotel vibe grows on you 
in the evening outside the room there was always a noisy party going on - the windows should better be 
priceline room not so great 
- the staff is enthusiastic and helpful- katie at the front desk and joey the conc 
for our first trip in penang we decidedto spent ours 3 last nights herewe chosed it 
which have a separate lounge 
on the second floor with a small to medium balcony with a lovely view of the sea 
- was hard to come by on at least two floors that we know of 
the front of house staff were on the ball - our waitress jessica being friendly 
the morning breakfast was pretty good and the location of the hotel was excellent - right in the heart of 
in-room safe and free daily bottles of water ( for being a diamond hilton member ) 
with great cocktails 
old world charm 
gym and pool were great and the location was perfect 
i am usually scared by large hotels but this time it was recommended by some friends for our first visit 
pre stay we emailed the hotel regarding gluten free diet and it was no problem 
the buffet breakfast had a very good selection - loved the freshly prepared fluffy roti canai and the 
we stayed in an executive suite but found that breakfasts were better in the restaurant downstairs than in 
nice modern decor with large balcony overlooking the river 
gravel-filled ledge right in front of our balcony ) and the room itself was very elegant ( 
the breakfast is always having a long queue and was very average actuallyalso they are not very guest friendly 
the staff were very friendly and accomadating despite being 'day trippers' 
this is a lovely hotel in a fantastic setting 
but this hilton is the worst ever - great location near theaters but book elsewhere - small ( very 
but you will be quite dependent on the hotels' restaurants for dinner 
sarkies is pleasant but very noisy - the veranda area is a better bet for seating or 
we didnt like the open bathroom 
there is a good pool and gym 
immediately placed it back on her tray our last dinner 
the infinity pool looked very inviting as did all the other open spaces 
the pool is nice 
the breakfast choice is outstanding and when eaten outside on the terrace is a superb way to start a 
typical tourist class hotel 
good size and the bathroom was large 
the onsite bar has a happy hour from 4 to 6pm each evening 
we also had a good sized balcony but being on the main road it was very noisy therefore it was 
the uncomfortable mattress meant an uncomfortable three night 's sleep 
very close to the park 
very good restaurants 
quiet and comfortable with free coffee and soft drinks 
the common areas are in need of a refurb 
) a nice little terrace 
the pool is shared by la fitness in the basement and it is a decent size 
the lobby and the hallways smell a bit like smelly feetthe restaurant in the basement can be 
we had an issue when we first arrived as receptionist seemed to struggle with english and then we ordered 
the resort is excellent combining all the facilities for a relaxing pause during a hectic three week tour of 
however the 2 swimming pools are good and a high number of sun beds available 
i would recommend this place for a family trip than a business one because the room and the services are 
it is also right opposite a large park which is lovely to walk around in the morning and seeing all 
in fact so small i could not even open my suitcase properly 
the location is just opposite of the pagoda park with beautiful views from the executive lounge 
on the way out today we noticed several new resorts being built around da nang so i suspect others 
the shower area was great - there was a really large wet room with rainforest shower - lots of 
one of the best beach hotels in vietnam in my opinion 
i changed some currency at the front desk and sought out rainly again to see if we could put 
great business hotel in good location 
overall an b- stay but very good prices and location is phenomenal 
oddly enough an apartment that big makes you feel too spread out if you are only staying 2 nights 
there is a little comfortable bar in the lobby - great for nice drink at night 
no mini bar fridge in room 
groovy colourful lighting options - red 
you need to queue up early or else you ca n't really see it 
the breakfast buffet in the restaurant is also exceptionally good 
it was worth the wait 
room not sound proof as we could hear clearly other guests talking next to us and on the corridor 
this hotel is an outstanding hotel near the barcelona sants train station 
staff are efficient and offers the bed and pillows good sleep quality 
after a long flight from asia 
this is an impressive hotel and when you arrive you get the feel that it 's five star despite 
right across the street from the barcelona sants train station and a couple of metro lines within easy 
i had two problems in the very first hour of checking in 
i stayed in this hotel several timesnice clean room the breakfast is ok and service is goodnot too 
the buffet was good and had both east and western foods 
ok service if you are not fussy 
there 's are many restaurants near by 
it is located very close to the airport with a regular shuttle service 
- sleep quality was wonderfuldislikes or what the hotel could do to improve 
small shots of juice or milkshake and even help clean your sunglasses 
check out was a breeze and highly recommended as a narita airport hotel 
the beach is clean and water is clear 
i just can say it is a great business hotel 
it becomes impossible to use the high speed internet password 
with good beds and lighting 
spacious and clean 
the stunning reception area has fabulous views over the bay 
beautiful rooms and good restaurants 
top notch 
retaining consistently good reviews is hard work for a hotel 
i have taken some tasty snacks and gorgeous from the pool bar 
breakfast buffet was disappointing - they did n't seem able to have the full choice of items available 
the breakfast selection was good but they do not have mushroom nor strawberry jam at the restaurant ( which i 
nice rooms bed to die for 
full range of hot items - eggs 
we stayed here for 2 nights to visit disney sea ! 
reasonable value and caters for a mix of short stay business and tourist travellers to nyc 
there 's a bakery opposite the reception where you can get some food if breakfast was not included 
then just behind the hotel on the 45th is decent casual cafe with great breakfast including cooked varied options 
the parking is expensive ( 18 day ) but we were told that it is a private car park - 
the lounge is good and the staff is very helpful 
the room was a good size with a chaise and a sofa as well as a decent work desk 
very good chef and staff 
there is a mini bar in the room and the prices were n't too outrageous by big city standards 
the lounge is pretty nice 
the club lounge was a nice surprise ( free afternoon drinks and food beer and wine service 'til 9 
the suite was great 
very close to the train station 
a small but functional gym 
the interior is very clean and refreshed 
it 's also one of the quietest hotels i 've ever been in and the beds are 
which was a fair price 
excellent concierge 
room good size and well appointed 
and an easy walk or subway to central park 
cool art deco vibe 
higher floors have better views 
the executive lounge was too small for all the people having access to it and the selection of canapes 
food very nice and staff very plesant too 
after sightseeing you can rest on yourbalcony looking over the sea 
the next morning , when the kids next door started to scream and hammer against the furniture . 
i stayed at the westin dragonara on business for 2 nights and the hotel was disappointing 
but one of the concierge was keen to refer us to a restaurant that had the word tourist 
the location is perfect , just one block off times square , in the middle of everything . 
nightlife for our younger traveller 
i like this one as it feels like a boutique hotel and the entrance was very inconspicous 
location is an easy 5 min walk from other paceville and st 
central location near stadtpark 
my first day i 've tried to pool restaurant and the food was horrible 
for the villa and the resort oozes detox with every fibre 
well light & some natural light as it was on a high floor 
had a few days free and decided to take our first trip to vienna 
concierge staff are friendly & very professional 
the water at the beach was crystal clear and the sand beautiful and white 
the bathroom was well appointed and had a separate shower and tub 
great restaurants were easily walkable nearby 
it felt like it was just a nice building with a lot of rooms 
the beds were very comfortable and the room size was big compared to most hk hotels 
thin walls 
the bathroom was massive with a separate shower tub 
and the bed is the best in the business - neither overly soft nor firm 
cutting through the huge shopping centre 
com on my previous visit to dublin and after a shambolic experience with the reservation decided to 
shower good 
great access for airport bus let you off right in front of the hotel 
staff are really nice & helpful 
the concierge organised restaurant bookings for us during our 4 days stay at great local eateries 
public areas are beautifully designed and practical 
notable for me was a good sized gym and really big pool partly outdoors and partly covered 
paying for internet is a pain but its free in the lobby and the breakfast had a good selection 
i was only staying for one night and it was a pleasant stay 
theres a massive shopping centre next to hotel with all sorts of brands from european 
this is not some hotel in a quiet area 
so i lugged our case up the stairs ( there is a slope 
great shopping nearby 
good lacation lots to do around go high no noise stayed on a sunday night unfortunately the restaurant 
i would stay here again if i needed accommodation in central leeds 
biggest advantage is that it is connected to a shopping mall and the sha tin mtr station 
and a good sized room with comfortable furnishings and bed 
the bar was occupied by a young clientele who seemingly use the hotel as a base for a night 
next to trinity college and near lots of restaurants 
go to the adjacent mall for a cheaper feed 
standard of the amenities first class 
hotel is in thw heart of the city across from trinity college so easy walking distance to sites 
everything about it was a very high standard from the water on arrival whilst checking in to the upgraded room 
executive floor with its facilities is one of the best we know 
well priced and highly recommended 
it is a standard smaller suite with a queen sized bedroom and an small sitting room where the hotel set 
the top of the shower looked as if it needed a good clean as it had that shower mould on 
near the train station 
the beach the resort sits on is a bit meh 
high floor for views 
it was not a nice trip except for the everglades national park which was wonderful 
they do have a nice pool with amazing views 
there was a cute little christmas gingerbread house display downstairs in the lobby with complimentary cookies - thought 
the weekend deal which includes breakfasts and valet parking is really worthwhile . 
need to walk down to the sea front to get decent restaurants 
so you can avoid the very expensive prices at the hotel food outlets 
room size is good for hong kong 
my only problem was with the front reception desk when checking out 
50 usd ) check-in was a bit of a pain as non-spg guests were 
the fitness center is clean with good equipment and the breakfast is exceptional 
nice lobby on secondfloor with brisa restaurant and separate bar 
ask for a high floor - beter aspect 
nearly the same size as the room 
it is expensive and really just above average in quality 
the bagpiper at sunset is always wonderful treat 
the buffet is fabulous especially the half crayfish and the chocolate selections 
the staff were ever helpful in the way only hyatt staff in this part of the world can be 
this was my first visit to hong kong 
i am comparing to a standard premierinn that i used 7 nights later and find myself thinking a good 
above the tsim sha tsui mtr and close to the shops on nathan road 
family enjoyed the buffet and the shops close buy 
we contacted reception and they moved us but not to the quality of room we paid for as no others 
if price is no constraint this one is excellent for business travellers 
mtr station is very close making going in to hong kong a breeze 
we found it somewhat lacking in certain vegetarian options 
having said that this is an old building that has been tastefully restoredstorage space more than 
the bathroom is also old 
it was a very nice boutique hotel 
i ordered soup and cheese burger and the food arrived in no time and the soup was quite hot and 
the hotel is very convenient to go to the airport because the airport shuttle is available from the hotel 
the breakfast buffet had a great assortment of items and eggs made to order 
nice hotel with great amenities smack in the middle of everywhere 
another fantastic andaz property 
we spent 8 nights here last week surrounding the chinese new year 
reasonably priced for a good hotel 
cafes and restaurants right around the corner and you are not too far from the more hectic 
or n3 form tsim sha tsui station ( which is quite a way to walk 
the service was top-notch from beginning to end 
and decently sized 
and there 's a mall ( k-11 art mall ) adjacent to the hotel 
great public spaces to hang out in 
all free in mini bar with exception of the booze 
with some of their staff not even aware of the fact these rooms lack windows to the outside 
the hotel is located next to the k11 shopping mall and there are lots of eateries over there 
for what the hotel will charge you 100 for 
for me the best is the lobby and bar which is like a living room 
the lobby area is quite nice and views are great 
the lounge service was good with staff trying to accomodate all wishes 
the pool area is more like a dance party and a little over the top 
very good facilities in a spacious hotel with good atmosphere 
nice selection of hot and cold dishes 
hong kong has no shortage of great hotels in tst but we consider the hyatt reg 
they were incredibly helpful at the airport as we were delayed because of the typhoon and arrived exhausted at 
stayed here for 6 nights in early february 2016 
luc at the president 's club desk was exceptionally helpful and cheerful 
rooms are of a good size and very comfortable 
new and clean with great rooms 
rooms are large with balconies but dated from the 1970s 
we were right near all the yachts and they were blowing their horns like crazy in celebration of 
- electricity ports are british 3 plug with one adaptor provided 
at the same time a complet enew look and feel led to the opening of one of the 
concierge and reception staff very helpful with a map and booking me a beauty appointment- ter 
bathroom is extremely large with marble fixtures 
this property is offering one of the biggest room as per the industry standards 
the hotel is also on the water and our suite had amazing canal view 
knowledgeable front desk who recommended the crystal club privileges 
central station 
good location 
was a big bonus 
we enjoyed the 'all you can eat' yum cha lunch in the chinese restaurant and it 
30 and were seated immediately since there were several empty tables ( 
the front desk staff took quite a while to find our reservation 
there are other choices on orchard but this hotel is as good as the meritus across the way 
a lovely breakfast is included with the room rate 
upon arrival we got a free upgrade which of course pleased us very much 
directly opposite paragon shopping mall 
the breakfast in the lounge was decent and i enjoyed the free alcohol and appetizers at night 
to catch the airport express to hkg 
and an elaborate break fast and there is a indian restaurant too in the hotel 
the hotel has great mtr access and is only a block away from all the shopping centers 
an electric heater and extra blankets were provided in the room 
the good side of this high tea is free flowing tea that they served and the ambience of the 
we were only staying one night so we just accepted that there was little we could do 
it is competitively priced 
excellent transport links . 
hotel even had a local mobile phone that you could use and make free overseas call 
the room service was also good and fast even if you are just asking for a bucket of ice 
the lobby on the 4th floor smelled great 
the staff have a great attitude 
habor city and the promenade 
next to k11 mall and tst station 
it 's about 30 minutes to the airport during non-busy hour and it costs about h 
my daughter loved swimming pool and overall had an excellent stay 
our beach front bungalow not only had a spacious modern bathroom with double shower 
tickets can be purchased at the terminal or at your hotel usually 
the room is very nice with new carpet and the marble furniture 
the hotel had also a nice outdoor pool area that i did n't try 
there is a decent swimming pool ( but i 've not used it 
they always have a la carte menu and daily feature menu 
bar food and in room dining were good 
the bar and restaurant service was only good if you knew which side to sit and have the right person 
we arrived by fast ferry from tahiti 
there is a large shopping mall in the same building complex 
they have a nice infinity pool and a water sports desk 
very nice finishings in both 
so if you want a piece of fruit etc be prepared to take shuttle into city and back 
very unaccommodating front desk - i had made my reservation well ahead of the 
both in the lobby area and the rooms 
beautiful interiors and design 
but did make the journey from the airport long and did not check in to the hotel until after midnight 
the hotel breakfast spread was very good and the quality is one of the best i have sampled 
location is on the river and a short walking distance to the center of town for restaurants and shopping 
the tiny club lounge was not available all day long as one would usually expect 
stayed at so many hotels before and this was the first time i went to a club lounge like 
wonderful amenities and just a wonderful space 
the decor was beautiful and the hotel 
my customer had a seminar for 20 doctors in one of the meeting rooms 
rather a soft bed 
a week prior to that we stayed on hong kong island and wanted to visit a different area 
i jokingly said that it was my first trip so i wanted some tips on how to spend my 
location is ok ( close to dai chi lake and related touristic area ) 
staff was friendly and the concierge went out of their way for us 
request a lake view room on a high floor 
one of the best i had at hotels 
we were graciously granted a late checkout on our last day but were disturbed at least four times by 
upgrading to a club room with lounge access is worth it 
one of the best resort in kunming 
the room was fine but light controls by the bed not completely functional 
a good location hotel with good service 
what a fantastic resort 
full of restaurants and nice shops 
ultra good value for money in hong kong 
i found the hot items lacking in variety that could be improved 
8 to 10 stations and a couple of transfers will get you to the hong kong core 
it is somewhat pricey but definitely worth it 
wii fii was effortless and i had a day in and enjoyed room service which was delicious 
first reaction to the club lounge was disappointing 
our room was large and well appointed with a big bath tub and lots of hot water 
public transport is very good in hong kong so it is n't too much of an issue 
rooms and especially bathrooms are very spacious for hk standard 
the buffet breakfast is excellent 
location may not be right in the city center 
nice big reception 
also nice pool for an afternoon dip 
as many hotels in the area do the posada hosts large tour groups 
no funny smells as reported by other reviewers 
we stayed here one night pre-cruise 
we had a complimentary good buffet breakfast 
i hope your front desk people can be trained better 
good size rooms with wifi 
the attached shopping malls are great choice for food 
and within walking distance to shops and restaurants and public transport 
it was not built as a hotel , does not have hotel standard fire safety , and does not 
the breakfast buffet was extensive and enjoyable- freshly squeezed orange juice 
all the facilities you might need ie washing machine 
the well-crafted use of the limited space 
front desk staff all very friendly and professional 
the items in the minibar were complimentary and restocked daily 
space is at a premium at ovolo 
the public areas and rooms were well designed 
despite the good apt and pool 
the reception staff are friendly and helpful 
and no real desk or space to do some work at 
upon check-in you just need to show your passport or identification card to verify your booking then they 
the hotel staff were very helpful 
the exec lounge itself is a nice space 
local area was quiet 
breakfast was included in our room rate and the food on offer was fine 
a free mini bar in your room 
easy walk to where you want to be 
a very spacious & well equipped apartment 
30am ) due to large tour groups 
the second of 3 hotels we stayed at in hong kong during a 9 night trip 
friendly staff 
most tables left dirtynot that i bothered too much but could not get the ac to workand did 
the skybus depot is a short walk away at southern cross station 
good living area and a decent kitchen 
i ten had to try to get on the hotel hoppa back to terminal 5 to try to find 
where its located in awkward place under the nightstand and you have to get on your hands and knees 
the bar on the 49 floor as an amazing view great bar food and the best cocktails 
my husband and i stayed at the mercure for one night before our flight and the service was outstanding 
but we did visit the bar and enjoyed drinks and the view 
had a team dinner one evening in the restaurant and the food was excellent 
it turns into an excellent bar 
after a long flight from london 
our superior room was very quiet and spacious and offered all the branded amenities you would need 
the bathroom is almost as large as the bedroom 
dinner and bar and made us feel welcome even if it was a cold 
the nearby free parking was great 
yet the suite sizes are generous and the service is more personal 
the pool is small and lounge chairs are packed on the deck like a pack of matches 
many excellent restaurants and bars 
this is more than i can say for other spas located on the strip 
com and got an amazing suite type room for the same price 
stayed for two nights in a small suite overlooking the bayroom was fantastic and the best staff i 
which was good but not cheap 
our son had a second bedroom with bath ( which could be a separate room ) 
it is pure luxury with great service from great staff 
airport is 20 mis away and the old city id just at your door step - no food late 
the corner sofas luxurious 
walking distance to the castle and royal mile and most other parts of edinburgh 
you wo n't find a soaring marble foyer trimmed with gilded gold and teeming with 50 
very modern room and bathroom 
the 'maxi bar' is a great touch 
the uncovered floor also allowed noise to carry to other floors ( like above us ) more than a carpet 
nice bar restaurant . 
excellent stay - great use of free nights 
the amenities were nice 
the swimming pool is beautifully designed and the gym is well equipped 
room service was good 
a nice shower and a comfortable bed 
it was clean with all amenities and excellent room service 
i would look for something in a more interesting and historical building 
superb gym better than most city club gyms 
check in was done at level 8 for executive rooms and they provided free light meals in the executive lounge 
the bed room layout very decent and have big and amazing bathroom 
amazing pool 
overall the sheraton is a mix of plush luxury and cheap fittings 
and unlike other trendy hotels 
i found the club lounge breakfast tastier than the happy hour offerings 
highly recommended for family or corporate trip 
our kids enjoyed themselves too in the pool ( which was much too cold to swim in for a longer 
in a city like hk 
the rooms are very well equipped and are in general very clean 
great facilities top notch service 
the building is in an old colonial house and full of character 
breakfast offered an adequate selection of hot and cold buffet with eggs cooked to order 
centrally located hotel with pleasant public areas and lovely pool 
leave the blinds open for the full experience 
the bathroom was clean and functional 
tv and all the items you would expect 
we throughly enjoyed the spg hospitality at the westin and the fact that the had a kids 
the hotel beach has white sand and is pristine 
no bathrobe and pretty tacky toiletries 
the bed was chinese like and hard 
many others were distinctly unbalinese in their responses to simple requests ranging from dining to practical ( do 
the swimming pool which looked fantastic on photo but a letdown in reality 
it is close to the main shopping area as well as a quick drive to kl towers and pet 
i would have thought that this was not a high cost to fix or change equipment like this 
the afternoon free drinks and nibbles were really great 
but let me assure you that any negative reviews of this hotel would have to be because of personal taste 
the rooms are very modern and equipped with everything you need - they also have great baths and fantastic showers 
the weather in june was just perfect with 23-27 celsius and windy on the beach 
a very very good resort 
rooms are spacious and very clean 
the hotel staff are extraordinary helpful and friendly 
it has a closet like a cute wardrobe room with kind of long bench from wall to wall like sofa 
i upgraded my room to a premium room and glad i did 
check in was smooth and the hotel provided a refreshing drink and cold towel during check in 
modern and the staff very friendly 
this is a high quality kuxury hotel with all of the friendly touches and one of our favourites 
the train station is right across a broad square to the east and very convenient 
a personal thing but all the family said the beds were particularly comfortable plus we had a room overlooking the 
the negativethe resort is huge and the new premier wing is far away from everything 
location is good you can easily walk to all kowloon has to offer 
the beach and pool next to the resort is amazing perfect for couples and even families with kids 
will certainly come back again soon . 
who really cares about each guest and is a consummate professional 
it 's a mega sized concrete hotel set around a series of pools on a beach 
the price is about idr 60-70000 for a van with toll included 
thank you all for making our stay a memorable one 
having an mtr station entrance opposite main entrance makes getting around hkg simple 
the gift sop was stocked with pretty object6s and at fair prices 
we loved all the little touches such as afternoon tea by the pool 
the hotel itself is excellent and the restaurants cannot be faulted 
fantastic view . 
we had pizzas and burgers for our dinners and the prices 
the initial room i stayed in was lovely 
we stayed 2 nights & left early mornings & returned in the evenings so we did n't really spend 
but singapore has so many great hotels that sometimes we are faced with a huge array of choices 
every hyatt should learn from them or follow their hospitality standards 
an area of improvement is room cleanliness 
the hotel feels old and needs a refresh to say the least 
this one is a huge disappointment . 
good location 
for lower priced dining options 
right next to orchard road with plenty of shopping and food options close by 
the gym and swimming pool is excellent and there is also a top quality steam room 
whilst the club lounge hasa good range of drinks on tap 
the room was spacious and comfortable but be aware that booking a club room does not guarantee a view of 
it gives a great skyline 
superb hotel in hong kong we wanted to stay in the kowloon area and this 
jasmin tea and fruit on arrival in room a nice touch 
large closet space etc 
no flat tv or latest hi tech but nice bathrobe and great bed 
the hotel is centrally located 
the typical marriott colours were familiar 
room was good size 
the room is quite spacious and very comfortable 
rooms are quite minimal with nice furnishing 
just across the street from victoria habor and next door to many good restaurants and bars 
good sized gym and a very nice executive lounge on the 23rd floor 
the food is great - no complaints at all 
special mention for the gluten free muffins 
a really effective shower and an ipod dock player 
i love the breakfast area where you can sit outside and listen the birds 
the food delicious and the service overwhelming 
the room is always impeccable 
the lobby is too small 
great buffet breakfast and great selection of wines at the bar 
situated in the historic world heritage city 
turn left and the entrance to the tsim tsa tsui east mtr is less than 
this is a beautiful property with an amazing staff 
as they are located on the main floor 
the en suite rooms are spacious and the bed is firm 
walking around the property is an absolute pleasure 
lounge was nice and staffs were helpful 
at check-in the room smelled fresh and a large fruit basket with beautiful ripe peaches and pl 
it 's a long walk to pool if your not over that side 
however the hotel is cramped with people dining at cafe cool and the lobby lounge at weekend 
in part it is the nice ambience of the rooms ( and i have been in both wings ) 
food is varied and good quality 
also the pool area is more like a playground for little kids and not relaxing 
we tried three of the hotel 's restaurants 
the quality of the hotel is fine 
the concierge team were great too 
the staff is very helpful and pleasant 
i am a hyatt visa card holder so internet is free 
i find the price in nearby hotel like mutiara more attractive since its renovation 
lifts practically full with people & had to wait for 4 full lifts before getting down for checkout . 
minimalist with wooden floorboards 
the location is right in the center of shopping so you can visit all of orchard road and the 
the spread of food was very impressive and the evening snacks were actually like dinner 
a nice touch was that we were allowed to use the health club to freshen up before we left 
) - black out curtains 
walkway to harbor is close by for a nice walk or run ( if you can stand the heat 
we requested ice and extra hangers and they not came within 5 min 
very comfy bed 
bright and features a decent size marble bathroom 
this is going to be a whiney review but if you follow me you will know why 
the pool is nice 
the rooms are huge and well appointed 
when you order the same dish another day 
down to the tapas bar for beautiful spanish sizzling prawns ( lovely and spicy 
from the lobby up to my room everything was perfect quick check in and check out friendly staff helpful conc 
the room is getting old and kids club is far away from the hotel and also poor condition 
more or less complete bar selection for free during 6-8pm 
the buffet at breakfast was great but not replenished regularly so you had to ask for things they had 
it was so quiet and relaxing there compared to the rest of the resort 
good size and full facilities including free wi fi 
the room itself was very comfortable and clean 
the lounge is very nice 
with a lovely comfortable bed and a great bathroom 
the breakfast buffet offered a vast array of options although i did not use any of the other dining facilities 
robes and towels were high quality but room furnishings and bathroom nothing special 
and fraser island is worth it nevertheless ) 
in a convenient area 
it 's just next to the central station which is 2 to 3 minutes walk away 
the price is good 
the service at reception was efficient 
free wifi was good 
it 's like staying with your favourite relative 
if there was a down side and you are particularly sensitive to this 
but brussels is a wonderful city for a week-end 
nice decor 
the hotel has a convenient luggage storeage area free of charge 
this time i chose the city side room which i guess is a bit smaller and older than the rooms 
the front desk staff was welcoming and efficient 
the room is nice and spacious 
the hall carpet is old and has a horrible order 
free wi fi was good and powerful the bathroom was a good size with a big shower 
the beds were extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean 
dont expect 5 star facilities like a spa 
most of the people that were with me had the same complaints and they were approx 150 of us 
the snacks bar located near the reception is excellent and provides really good stuff to eat all the time 
rooms were good but unfortunately it only has a shower 
the wonderful breakfast and the evening drinks provided a great time to relax and meet fellow travelers 
but the wifi is free and the hotel has some great gathering areas with views and good food 
although the free internet was painfully slow 
we were facing the back on the 6th floor and within the room there was no outside noise 
there 's now tub but there was a massive shower 
i set an average expectation due to my prior real experience with lexis 
breakfast was disappointing with very limited spread of variety 
ideal location well appointed rooms 
excellent service and foodif you are in buenos aires for a visit 
all the furniture looked really old and need to be replaced asap but the bed was comfortable and everything 
classical service 
ask for high floor to be above street noise and to get little natural light in room 
while the suite was amazing what really makes this hotel special is the staff 
they also forgot to give fresh towels 
which was treated like it was the hardest thing in the world 
i was very happy with my stay 
the staff were polite and friendly 
but while it may be the same building 
beautiful historic hotel with an amazing lobby bar . 
the beach right in front also gets pretty crowded during the day 
doubt it could be placed much better in the city 
was though very clean and very usable cleanness both the room and the common areas were very clean and 
it is also a very amazing building 
it was made with two flat sheets 
the decor was very scandinavian simple ( think ikea ) i was given a room 
sir harry 's bar was a wonderful experience ( ben kingsley was next to us ) 
i will stay here again as it is very centrally located and all the staff were very friendly and helpful 
room service was great 
many of those attending clearly had n't read the reviews & did n't upgrade & because the basic 
but the staff was pleasant 
the hardrock is right next door with great bars and restaurants which makes it very easy to go out 
a little pricey 
all the flower arrangements have been removed and even the carpets in the public spaces are dirty 
there is a great bathroom with large shower which has a tiled floor which is n't slippery 
there was no mini bar 
large soaking tub 
public areas were all grand 
both hotels unfortunately are rated 5 stars but when compared with hotels in asia 
have been really impressed by the stylish 20 30er deco in the entrance area 
the lobby and common areas of the hotel are fantastic 
turn left at the beach and walk 1 mins and rent from the beach vendor ( dark green umbrell 
soap shampoo etc was fairly basic for a hotel at this level 
excellent bedding and sleep quality with good choice of pillows 
nice hotel with great location 
stayed here for 4 nights last month 
we arrived at 7am due to an early flight from rio 
a short taxi ride to the met 
the staff are really amazing and nice and helpful and all look with great experience 
our room on the 7th floor was very good and large by new york standards and very clean 
some basic mid-day snacks 
comfortable lounge for continental breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese in the afternoon 
beach restaurant food was good ( flatbread pizza excellent ) - service was terrific and beer wine cold 
on the lower floors in the tower 
we had a club room and thought it was terrific - lots of good options and a fun feel to 
my son is diabetic and so sugar free drinks are good for him 
had fast wireless internet access 
when she went to the front desk 
- executive lounge is good in overall but very small and the service there is slow ( i 
the hotel is over the elements shopping center and the kowloon station 
good executive lounge 
quite busy with young americans on holiday getting drunk 
this hotel can be easily reached either by airport shuttle from terminal 2 or by the airport train ( middle 
the bed was comfortable and the closet space was adequate 
multiple restaurants to choose from 
at check out the supervisor asked about my stay and i explained my disappointment with the service as a top 
apologies do not help what could have been a nice relaxing trip 
the view across the bay to hong kong from my room on the 109th floor was stunning 
one of the big deciding factors for us choosing a hotel was a nice pool experience 
staff very helpfull 
the starbucks across the road is a bonus as breakfast is expensive in the mondrian and the 
close to airport but better hotels available for cheaper price 
service was as expected but room service was late in delivering the food 
also the breakfast is much better at the sheraton than the hilton 
the swimming pool was nice and has long opening hours 
the bed was n't very comfortable 
though perfectly located by the beach 
this hotel is stunning 
very good ( but expensive ) internet 
albeit you can see the beach from your table 
great hotel could be better the hotel itself is amazing and the views breathtaking but where this hotel falls compared 
service was excellent 
spent 2 nights at this hotel for a tel aviv conference and was put up in the renovated 
although the walk outside is not entirely covered overhead 
you can get to the airport and other parts of hong kong fairly easy without even walking outside 
the hilton paris cdg airport hotel remains a wonderful choice 
executive lounge was located at the ground floor 
a very short walking distance from the lounge making it super convenient 
loved having ozone lounge on the top floor for lazy nights when i did n't want to leave 
the staff was super nice 
because it occupies the highest floors of the highest skyscraper in hong kong 
one coffee machine was available and it was tricky to operate and required multiple fixes by staff 
the view across the harbour was phenomenal and the service and food offerings in the club lounge were very good 
and exec lounge ) were very helpful going above the level of my expectations 
i arrived in the hotel to find a large and spacious lobby 
all in all a mixed experience and the fact that the day rooms become available later should have been clearer 
located in a nice area with convenient travel options to airports 
i had a choice to use the el but more atmosphere in the main lobby bar 
do n't miss the veggie dumplings at the hotel restaurant at the breakfast buffet 
i concluded the reason for this is due to the management team- it is old style ritz car 
the swimming is excellent and whilst i did n't use it 
the excellent gym was usually empty and the pool seemed to always be quiet 
i was on 7th floor only so did n't have the views talked about by some other reviews 
make sure your room is not on the side of the building where construction work is being undertaken 
very adequate drawer space was provided 
the bath also was large with many luxury amenities 
i agree that boutique means small and classy but it does not mean dark and impractical 
the main building is built in a traditional style and is really beautiful 
i like to be able to walk to the center 
my only downside is that there is no courtest room to shower and change if you have a late 
this is held around the pool area and makes for a congenial setting to meet your fellow travellers 
do n't go for a king bed as one side is against the wall 
i also miss some of the standard amenities 
this is my first time staying at carlton city hotel 
the lounge had enough food to cater for a large wedding banquet 
the size of the restaurant is rather small so the tables are tightly packed near each other 
and that means the much-vaunted view from the 10x floor can be non-existent much 
there is a decent city cafe within walking distance and food and service there was excellent 
the bed was too soft for our liking but everything else was great 
there was every room amenity you could possibly want 
cocktail is also acceptable 
there is 2gb of free wifi available each day 
the balcony had automatic lights ( weird times 
we spent two very comfortable nights in the hilton milan 
spectacular views and very modern facilities 
this is my second visit to this restaurant . 
the hotel gym was nicely equipped but not great ( want more heavy-duty equipment ) 
basically could be anywhere - except for the good pasta on the menu no particular local flair 
a single bed instead a king size bed 
but not a romantic spa hotel 
we got a great deal over their website for a special family room which included buffet breakfast daily 
they should have a reserved sign on it to prevent the awkward situation for the gym attendant always having to 
providing frozen orenge juice in the lobby was also a nice touch 
the buffet breakfast was poor and clearly had been sitting for sometime and the scrambled eggs were of the powdered 
these hotels welcome their loyal customers and you will be treated much better 
there is a public bus that runs every thirty minutes or so to from town but is a bit pricey 
a deep bath 
the sauna was too small and the pool area was a bit too ordinary as well 
there a computer in the corner of the lobby for your use 
if you are going to hong kong and want luxury , this is the place to stay 
stay on a high floor and request club access 
the breakfast buffet had good variety 
luxury and business hotel--- tallest building in hk 
the hilton milan is a typical business hotel that was recently refurbished 
i also had to ask for a glass as they basically threw down a partial place-setting at the 
the asian street market and the xmas buffet 
the bar is worth a visit for an even higher view 
) food very elaborate and high quality 
they finally 'found' our reservation but we were unable to get key since the rooms not yet ready 
a good location hotel 
the view from my room on the 111th floor was spectacular 
the room was on the 116th floor with spectacular views ( if the weather and smog allow it 
on an overnight visit 
the room is not bad with separate shower and flat screen tvdid n't use the gym nor 
the room finishes and lobby bar area are excellent and the service first class 
not exceptional but good quality and everything worked well 
the hotel is on floors 103-118 of the icc tower the highest building in hk with 
very well equipped and had a mini ipod with various jazz playlists that we played - nice simple 
i even opened the window and the room is still very hot 
nice facilities execelent services 
the reservations staff are very prompt to respond via email 
but were disappointed on arrival after a long flight and a long drive from lax to encounter self-service 
but in a good area and i like radisson hotels in europe so i decided to stay 
great bath and bed 
incredible service all round 
anyone that i dealt with from the hotel was friendly 
the south tower is across the street accessible by an underground passage but easy to access and quieter than the 
we had to keep our curtains closed to stop people being able to see us get changed etc 
the tables are similar to school meals just plain formica top 
the kid spaghetti and meatball dinner had nasty rubbery meatballs and there was a chicken dish with 
but perhaps in an impersonal business hotel way 
acceptable for a short stay 
in my opinion since the rooms are very small and noisy i recommend it for short stays or for people 
great location overlooking the canal great location , with access to all major city attractions . 
the bed was large and comfortable 
the reception was fairly busy but the check-in was quick efficient and friendly 
the lobby is very nice and the staff is friendly and helpful 
just basic beds 
the staffs at front desk were also amazing 
the room i had reserved which was a private balcony 
if you want a hotel which is centrally located for your shopping spree and nice food with some nice light 
there are many walkable restaurants nearby and if you want to shuttle to disneyland 
rooms are easily accessible from street 
the rooftop bar was a nice place for a drink 
everything functions well and the location is great with many nearby restaurants and within a short taxi or tram ride 
room is just flawless and the best is most comfort one i ever sleep in a hotel . 
no light over shower therefore dark when curtain closed 
the payment page threw up a price double 
good beds 
the room was spacious and well laid out 
fuel offers a mix of casual dining 
club lounge is nice 
the room was large although we thought the beds were on the smaller sided 
absolutely acceptable and they worked really hard to solve the problem 
clean with a great bathroom 
the hotel is not in a good location for long beach - it is a good 30 minute walk to 
ask for a loft suite if you are flying with family 
especially for an airport hotel 
rooms are good sized and definitely improved over the years 
this marriott has a nice location 
an old building but very tastefully maintained 
take the shuttle if you do 
good facilities 
having bowl of apple at front desk was good touch- there is a mini-refrigerator but 
prepared for the usual 45 minute drive airport to beijing hotel i was pleasently surprised by the 
restaurants around that area were nice and they all opened till late 
the air conditioning is ridiculously noisy circa 1970s too and the bathrooms are also very dated . 
our room was clean and comfortable 
particularly liked the ipod docking station and the great bathroom 
realistically despite its enormous size and marble lobby it can be best described as 3 star 
the staff were lovely and ready to help in any way they could 
bathroom is small with shower over bath 
elevators you can see the shaft of ) 
the price seemed reasonable compared with similar offerings in london ( unfortunately 
water and other drinks - best of any hotel during our visit hotel has great facilities but when the guides 
the staff are pretty friendly 
breakfast is a buffet - while the range is limited to a few hot dishes 
this hotel is so convenient for an early morning flight and with the complementary shuttle it is a winner 
hot shower with good pressurecomfortable bed with choice of pillowsrelatively quiet considering it was at 
well worth a visit 
multiple restaurants 
cold and hot bath 
i was told by driver that she was full with a flight crew and to wait for her to come 
bed comfortable and bath luxurious 
the royal park occupies the lower and upper floors of an unassuming building convenient to shimbashi and 
it was very late since haneda was closed due to an airliner fire and i had to scramble 
very good location for business travelers - shiodome train station just bellow 
some minor niggles where that at 05h00 on saturday morning my shower had no hot 
clean decor 
this is a very good hotel in a good location right next to shiodome metro and very handy 
it is one of the better hotels i 've stayed at in tokyo and the staff were 
beautiful corner room ( room 2910 ) 
the ritz-carlton is a centrally located and very busy hotel with comfortable rooms and good 
a great location -- you 're just above the tokyo metro stop and there is a 24 
bar staff were incredibly helpful 
you only get wireless access in the lobby ( but for the exact same price as if you were accessing 
hotel is located in the city centre 
club level is good with a nice spread of food 
the hotel lobby starts on the 24th floor and all the rooms are the floors above 
this happened to me recently in the shanghai branchworst of all bell desks jumping at you while 
tha airport limousine and the station 
stayed here for 3 nights and the most impressive thing about this hotel is that it is clean 
it 's reached easily via the limousine bus from either narita or haneda airport 
bathroom was reasonable in size considering the size of the room 
very old building 
i just loved this property and you will rack up the marriott points with every stay 
i attended business meetings here and the banquet staff was outstanding 
with good eateries within walking distance 
comfortable business hotel in downtown portland 
parking is expensive 
with good linens and towels 
many exquisite restaurants surround the hotel along with other top class hotels 
all in a great experience and a great place to stay if you need to be in canary wh 
reasonable size 
it 's only a short stop away by jr train if you do n't mind the travel 
the breakfast manager was amazing and i was very impressed on how he handled her he was so professional 
a very nice lobby 
a bad thing is that the walls are paper think so you can pretty much hear the people in the 
with nice large rooms ( very large for a time square-area hotel ) the hotel has the city 
perfect for getting to monza f1 ( the main reason we were in milan on this trip 
just get a tiny bed and that 's it 
the service was excellent and very attentive during my stay 
it will only suit you if you are not looking for big rooms ( which rooms in tokyo 
they charge you an absurd mandatory resort fee of approx 30 night in order to have free international national calls 
and well equipped - it was great value for money 
easy to walk to the beach and easy to wander around the area and see some attractions 
breakfast was very poor - just coffee pastry 
reasonable price & good location just close to the shinjuku station 
the closest metro was seibu shinjuku 
a bonus is the nightlife available in close proximity to the hotel 
consistent ibis quality 
bathroom has great toiletries 
breakfast was included with our room and the buffet had a good spread 
reception staff and front desk and concierge were all great - but waiting staff in the temporary 
snacks all day and a good choice of beverages 
big bathroom with tub 
my executive room was spacious and clean with a large comfortable bed and had everything you would expect a h 
the pool is small and unclean 
the adult and kids pool were combined 
they are great value for a huge amount of delicious food 
goverdhan is responsible for developing this lush property and spent years to create an oasis that 
top-floor beach-view rooms are great 
very busy area and good restaurants around 
the food is also well prepared and tasty 
simply not worth the price paid 
the theatre district is a small block up 
the newer tower wing is fresh and the rooms are clean and bright 
the reception staff were excellent and very helpful 
great location and experience 
service top notch 
the bar an in-place - make sure you get a room higher up as this place is a

staff at reception extremely nice and friendly 
major restaurants 
best location for tourist 
great fluffy towels and a nice shower 
very simple breakfast 
the amenities are good the restaurants are very good with good food 
good quality bed and pillows 
and waiting more than 20 minutes in the howling winds of the airport 's hotel bus pick- 
two complimentary bottles of water daily 
the bathroom is tiny but it does have a decent shower and proper bath 
the hotel is in a great location where you can easily walk to many good restaurants in chinatown or 
bright and beautiful room decor 
location is great to be able to walk to the palace and museum 
new hotel with modern decor 
i was upgraded to a suite upon check-in ( spg platinum ) and the front desk staff 
the reception desk is located a few levels up and once there 
one small disadvantage of room 16 was that as it was directly below the roof top bar you could here 
the great location just set back from hastings street is the main appeal for us 
great facilities and breakfast 
hotel staff are knowledgeable and helpful 
they have a good asian restaurant and a very good gym 
at the end of the street outside the hotel is upper penang road which has a few bars and

satisfied pros , - great breakfast buffet- attentive service- clean rooms and environment- accom 
buffet food very average and catering to mass market crowd 
the bathroom was also big 
the 'dine around' package is great value 
lots of choice and very good service only let down would be the slow service when making a request 
at this top level of hotel and room rate 
guv ) and the driver even spouted about some unhappy guests he 's delivered and uplifted 
the concierge was very efficient and booked tickets for a show for me with very short notice 
got to admit the spa was pretty good 
the toileteries were very basic thoughthe breakfast buffet was fairly basic 
a diet coke in the mini bar is 5 which seems extreme for a can but you apart from 
beautiful public spaces with lots and lots of flowers 
i had room service and had a good prawn dish 
rooms are good size and well appointedstaff are excellent in all waysi left something in my room and 
breakfast buffet was excellent with a good choice of food 
alongwith 2 complimentary bottles of water ( you can ask housekeeping for more ) 
the breakfasts were excellent and the staff was tried its best 
top notch 
hard rock cafe ( the first one in the world ) is also located around the corner 
staff outstanding in friendliness and helpful 
the upstairs balcony is smaller but has 2 comfy chairs which we easily settled into 
) -staff treats burners like second class citizens but i think that may be everyone-assume 
this is one of the better places to stay on the island if you really want to stay at all 
facilities were great & staff were very friendly & helpful 
there is a shuttle that will take you to downtown coronado 
the front desk was courteous and helpful at check-in 
and great cuisine 
there is also a small and modern gym on level 1 
yes it is a little pricey in comparison to other intercons but you are in the centre of l 
had a nice visit to the loews on coronado - but be aware - it is somewhat removed 
the reception staff and the service staff were very attentive and were out of their way to remember our names 
the trees and birds block out the sounds of the city . 
i stayed here for one night in march 
conference rooms are good & food is much better than most conference meetings 
service was courteous and hospitable . 
i happened to enter my room mid cleaning and i could see how my belongings are being put in places 
room decor and bath luxury plus great drink menu 
taj westend is a very comfortable resort style hotel in bangalore 
club lounge amazing . 
the staff was helpful and the service was good 
i will definitely go back and recommend it as one of my true greatest hotel experiences ever 
drinks throughout the day and snacks at tea time were provided for free in the club lounge on the 
though not a great value 
the staff are quite friendly and helpful 
a special mention for the excellent concierge mohammed musavir who went that 
the spa is excellent and the fitness centre crisp and clean 
concierge services are excellent though they are a bit stretched 
pool with slide kids club with great stafflovely staff 
the bed was most comfortable and the room was also very quiet which made our sleep undisturbed 
there were many scratches on the furniture and a general worn down feel to much of the room 
the distance was short but with the hot temperatures 
with restaurants & convenient stalls once you walk out 
went to the bar for an after dinner drink one night and had to listen to staff drone on and 
the standard of catering and the quantity of food was superb 
but at a more attractive price due to current forint exchange rates 
the lobby is small but attractive and well staffed 
all staff were unfailingly polite and helpful 
the room was large and clean and the window opened so i could get fresh air 
easily one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in 
this is a very centrally located hotel in the middle of town 
kudos goes to the excellent concierge staff 
a lovely high standard luxury hotel 
the hotel airport transfer was excellent although there are other cheaper options 
very attentive front of house staff and prompt professional staff throughout 
rooms are well cleaned and decorated 
the staff at the reception and the concierge were professional and efficient but they will not greet you 
to a person - front desk 
i found the bathroom small and carpet worn out 
pool and gym is very far awaytransport to from airport is a joke 
even on the ground floor rooms you cannot hear outside noise 
the rooms are comfortable and the breakfast very good with lots of choices 
they offer free transport to the airport 
with a great bed 
the bathroom huge with a jacuzzi tub and a separate rainshower 
just stayed in the emirates sector of the hotel for a quick overnight between 2 flights 
there are restaurants and shops nearby 
there were several bars 
this room is advertised in normal times at nzd 109 
this place is really close to the airport and they send a car to pick you up and drop you 
very well located close walk to the cbd fully self contained apartment with all the appliances 
the decor of the lobby area and the breakfast room bar is really trendy 
also the rooms are cramped and poorly configured while our double bed was actually two single mattresses pushed together 
a normal price by local standards 
they only provide limited arabic menu 
the smallest apartment ever 
helpful and professional the room was large very comfortable and quiet the location by the airport is very good 
close to the airport wtih a swimming pool 
for a quieter room i would avoid those overlooking portman square where the traffic is busy 
very surprising hotel 
our room ( 308 ) and private villa ( 512 ) were very big and gave us great views 
but honestly for dubai i think its very very old if you care about the decoration and modern stuff 
fortunately no one made too loud noises after 10pm and so we were still able to get decent sleep 
this is the biggest villa i have ever seen 
the beach is private and the sand is a little gritty but this is not an issue 
amazing shower and even the toiletries are good ( malin & goetz ) and also for 
good selection of restaurants was put up here by emirates due to missing connecting flight . 
the hotel offers many good facilities like several restaurants 
if was not for poor service 
large and feature all amenities you could look for on a beach retreat 
rooms and amenities provided is first class not forgetting the complimentary sweets & champagne offered to us on our stay 
so really peaceful with effective black out blinds 
we have now stayed in 3 cgh hotels and they have all been excellant they go all 
shower is fantastic 
there is a good shop and bar area but not many guests seem to use this 
eco friendly resort 
i consider this to a good value 
spread out with large cottages set in park like setting 
the hotel gave us a free shuttle back to the airport 
we only had one night which was a pity as could n't really take advantage of all the facilities 
with a great open space lobby 
lovely lobby to chill out in and there is even cookery classes held in a kitchen if you 
bathroom was tiny & had no basic toiletries 
good bedding 
easy going helpful efficient and checkout was quick and smooth 
very friendly staff at breakfast 
nice big rooms and bathroom 
the overall package however is one that is very good you will feel more like a house guest than a 
it does seem more set up for business meetings as they have plenty of meeting rooms available and the restaurant 
the lounge is not open for breakfast per say but it did have croissants 
the hotel is 15 minutes walk from the train station and one block from the river 
the executive room ( 643 ) was lovely and had a room divider with tv that revolved 
with 2 hot selections 
the tub was a good size and the rain shower was great 
a bathrobe as well as a dressing gown together with slippers was great and the cookies on the 
so we sat in the beautiful lobby lounge and waited 
good gym and great club lounge facilities 
the only negative is that the restaurant on 24th floor only serves dinner 
very modern hotel in a very good location next to a tube station and close to many attractions in center 
i rarely give a very high rate review of a hotel 
they have a full bar of drinks 
our towels were rather thinner than i would have liked or expected and a few bedroom features did not seem 
see my next review 
only managed to stay for one night 
bathroom was huge 
but not in any way comparable with my experience of cheap hotels in london either 
very good value for money 
we ate most of our breakfasts on the executive floor which was good---the only note i 
as others have said this hotel has nowhere near the 5 feel of the park lane ic or the w 
we spent several nights in a club room 
and the relativley small lobby and reception area gives the hotel a personal feel that other five star 
we booked a suite which is like a stylish apartment 
nice bar 
i asked on my booking in the comments section of the online form if we could get a bonus like 
good value for money 
the property is located in the heart of london near westminster abbey and across from the st 
we had a lovely spacious 
james station right across the street 
plus a lovely plate of fruit and handmade chocolates - nice touch 
the bathroom was more 3 than 4 but the shower was very powerful and the towels were large 
easy to walk around city from here 
and great beds 
we have a beautiful 1 bedroom suite available 
plenty of fluffy towels were supplied 
free wireless internet- small rooms but with everything you need 
ample storage is a delight and a bright 
the location was great 
the hotel is in the historic part of the city and even though the building is old 
the lobster and oysters were great and at a good price 
it was a nice stay 
we got a lovely upgrade 
it is probably better suited for those wearing shorts rather than suits 
the breakfast is rich and varied 
the exec lounge in both the evening and for breakfast the next morning was pretty good and overall the stay 
it was great to just walk off the platform 
beautifully decorated and very comfortable 
room was a deluxe very plush and modern enjoyed watching the tv in the bath that was a nice 
comfortable beds and all the amenities you need 
dreary room with one very small window right in the corner which gave onto a dark shaft 
the shower was a nice size but poor execution on the design 
the room was small 
the wifi is fast enough 
the bathroom was nice size with good water pressure 
arrived for checkin at 3pm but the front desk was full with groups checking in 
really wanted to add to my last review where i mentioned the seating the in bar - glad to say 
only 20 minutes from lhr on the paddington express ( gbp20 one way ) 
my only ( small ) negative would be the lack of facilities - pool , gym etc but this 
cocktail bar is first class and you have access to the palm casino if you 're feeling lucky 
beautiful small pool 
the restaurant food is also nice 
i ca n't imagine why you would need such a myriad of lighting combinations unless you were dating the 
this resort is quite good with a super view and well maintained garden etc 
the rooms are tired chain hotel type rooms- really nothing special at all 
views from the room are limited as its a busy neighborhood 
if the price is good 
in a busy area 
although the views from the roof top bar restaurant were very good after dark 
alight at 4th stop ( jordan ) and walk less than 5 mins 
we would be happy to stay again 
the best thing is it comes with high speed free wifi as well as all items in the mini- 
they are going to have many more disappointed guests 
we did n't mind because when we checked in at 3pm they upgrade our room to junior suite 
but the hotel charged the full room service breakfast price on top of that with no discount reflecting the inclusive 
the best they could provide us with was a fan and say that due to too many people using the 
stayed for one night in a double room 
so in case one needs to connect to heathrow by the airport express 
especially not in the front desk 
it is located in a neighbourhood rather than in over rated times square and other tourists hoo ha 
beautiful interior & bar 
it is an old hotel with nicely renovated rooms 
we booked the standard room which was a good size for quite a central london location and the bathroom 
complimentary mineral water 
family friendly hotel 
the shuttle bus is directly stop at the hotel and lotte department store is just next to the hotel 
perhaps this property is really best suited for families traveling with children 
good wifi as well as good service 
the hotel is integrated into a paddington station and very convenient to move around 
the actual room size is fine for one and the bathroom served its purpose was clean and the shower was 
this property is simply old and huge with an elevator count ( all small decrepit looking ) obviously insufficient 
i booked a single room and was given what can only be described as a small cupboard 
large walk-in closet area and a large clean functional bathroom with both a walk-in shower and 
they are building a new 128 story tower across the street 
it 's a real olde-worlde layout with lots of wood 
the wifi is terrible and drops out continually ( it 's operated by swisscom 
you ca n't beat the location and the price is good for london but the thing that makes 
regis you need bikes at your disposal at all times as the property is too large to enjoy on 
cant wait to visit adelaide and the playford 
although the location is great and the hotel exterior is very charming and the interior is modern 
the lounge was great for a snooze when guru was stretched out on the bed 
adelaide railway station precinct opposite 
room was reasonable size with a very good bathroom 
the bathroom floor would get wet after each shower 
the hotel bar was busy with top notch service and a great atmosphere 
modern decor comfortable bed and extremely cleanservice 
there is a lovely small pool which was welcome after a long hot day sightseeing and they have a 
the choice of pillows satisfactory and the tv had a good range of channels 
hotel , very friendly , informative check-in . 
the beds and pillows so comfortable 
the room was small not really any view but the decor was elegant and the amenities were abundant and f 
its tastefully decorated with good sized rooms but no common areas except the welcome room and their terrace 
well worth a visit for couples or families 
we had drinks in the bar which were well priced and the cocktails lush 
if you want to stay in the pudong area ( ie east of the river and most tourists 
well appointed rooms of generous size and a breakfast that competes with any i have seen ( i love 
smelly trays of good such it was hard to take a case down 
overall a pleasant stay 
he informed me and the hotel 
the room was high standard and the bar service met our needs 
the hilton group really know how to look after their loyal customers 
service throughout was prompt and efficient right through from the friendly check in to the breakfast service 
classical perhaps being too broad a word to describe the exact style but it was certainly not a modern 
very nice boutique hotel 
a nice hotel in a city with a few 
it is far enough away from the central tourist buzz yet still walkable 
there are several outstanding restaurants within three blocks of the boscolo 
the hotel is 3 stories high and our room was located adjacent to the outdoor pool and at first we 
rooms are nice size ( if you get an executive room ) 
have to make the bed yourself 
as a female on her own the bar and restaurant area is great i ate here and sat for the 
you can hardly get a better location in the middle of the old city - you 're really a 
but the new building next door blocked it 's great view towards london eye 
only a four minute walk from the station and only a short to walk to great attractions 
great small hotel 
the staff is friendly and trying to help 
not sure about the earlier comment that this is one of the best hotels in asia 
overall a great stay 
gardens and restaurant were all excellent 
as far as my wife and i are concerned this will be our first choice when we return and 
our first trip to london and i need to say 
i stayed at this hotel for only one night 
good hotel - great staff - executive lounge facilities disappointing 
the hotel itself is nice enough 
the room we had was huge and quiet the breakfast was excellent and the cocktails superb 
00 on the street ) but very affordable compared to us and europe standards 
i greatly appreciated it 
wanted to stay longer but could n't 
efficient and hassle free 
the extreme wow suite here offers public a round bed and enough space for two and your most romantic weekend 
the service was impeccable and the spa was fantastic and reasonably priced ( 65 for a 60 minute massage 
the public areas felt like they needed a good spring clean 
very nice located w property overpriced as usually in paris plus as usually in w hotels 
nice price 
the food at the space just off the lobby was amazing 
we stayed here as part of a longer trip 
only 1 device given free wifi access per room 
its decor is modern 
the place could seem a bit expensive ( some fares throughout the year are quite high for paris 
service was excellent as was the room and entire experience 
i am a frequent traveler to india and have a work phone with international roaming available 
all in all a very pleasant stay 
for a large hotel it is highly recommended although inevitably the swimming pool area is crowded 
the hotel is stunning all around 
i would happily return but am conscious a number of other exceptional hotels are also available 
there 's an italian restaurant where the buffet breakfast is also held ( which is good ) 
free wifi in there on weekdays only 
sea-facing ones on higher floors may be good 
very limited food and drinks are available 
limited food selection downstairs since there 's no kitchen and parking was pretty expensive 
but i seemed to confuse the chef who was stocking up the buffet by asking for a mixed ome 
remote operated blinds for you to control your light intake from the side of the bed 
close to airport 
the shower and toilet are separated from the sink area by a sliding pocket door 
altough its a bit expensive on price but worth the price 
the business center cost a good sum of money to use and you were charged by the 1 2 hour 
the three restaurants and one bar inside the hotel is a good choice if you are not crazy enough to 
nearby aloft was a row of trendy bars and eating places like toby 's keiths 
to be fair this was in the middle of the monsoon and this is also my first time in 
very expensive buffets 
a nice hotel opposite the airport 
they also provide a phone which provides you a wifi hotspot and free international calls which is great 
the gym is fairly well kitted out though not huge 
the bed was large and comfortable and the most important for an airport hotel 
this hotel is right at the airport 
nothing special ( buffet style except for eggs hot dishes ) 
we stayed here for two nights recently and had access to the club floor - it was almost perfect stay 
add a wonderful view of the city and good service and it is a great place for a special night 
it is cheaper and more convenient to park at the hotel than in the nearby underground garage 
the grand club manager and his staff went straight into professional action and arranged for the doctor who arrived within 
perfect hotel for an amazing city 
good location beautiful hotel 
the pool area is particularly nice for an urban hotel 
the executive lounge facility was excellent and it is in a good location 
there were also a lot of restaurants nearby 
highly recommended . 
i was disappointed with khmer kitchen which received very high reviews 
extremely friendly and helpful front desk staff 
our second day we decided to get up early for the sunrise at angkor wat but had not 
at busy times there would not be enough beds for people 
breakfast buffet was a good spread but same food daily except for 1-2 changes such as mis 
large rooms 
very good stay at siem reap 
or take the subway and the ferry from wan chai to kowloon is close and enjoyable 
the one on the top floor is lovely 
from the airport you can take a cab ( about 40 usd ) or you can take the airport 
the lobby still has it 's grandeur and the food at grissini is still excellent but 
very nice facilities 
we had the very last room on the very end of the hall so we actually only had one neighbor 
one last comment was that they emailed me to check-out online and the bill was 100 spot on 
the room service is good and the food is good 
pool area was great with a small lazy river to float around 
nothing special . 
the lighting is also brilliant 
the toiletries were lovely and all the extra bits were useful 
great pool 
good sized rooms 
it continues to provide pleasant experiences with the club lounge and the views from the room and lounge as its 
if you are looking for a great value 
and there are absolutely great restaurants nearby--get recommendations from the front desk 
but nice receptionist advised me that my reservation was upgraded because of that 
these room need a major renovation and the construction around the property makes it worse 
nice hotel but not like a mandarin or peninsula 
as mentioned the restaurants bars are very expensive but obviously there are limitless cheaper alternatives outside the hotel 
it is in a terrible location on the strip - not where you would want to walk and in a 
while the room was clean 
i did not like the self check-in area 
so there is constant noise until about 6pm which made it hard to take naps 
the lounge spread was really nice and well located 
well appointed rooms 
but be aware of the traffic jams and the noise 
quiet despite construction site next door 
think lots of black marble and gold 
public spaces and luxurious bathrooms 
it is the best middle of the range hotel i have stayed at in the uk by a long 
it was not too busy and that was a good plus 
i ordered room service and the food came quickly and was of a good portion size and tasty and i 
if this is the part of the town you wish to be in 
we were then told to park outside the front entrance 
it was near good restaurants 
decent location with small rooms for the price paid 
this has very good value for money at around hk 300 for the tea set and the sweet buffet 
we had a nice apartment 
the lobby seems a bit dated but the rooms are modern and very comfortable 
the facilities are also good 
the fitness centre was well-equipped and the spa was enjoyable each visit 
and is a short walk to the old town and railway station 
generally great value for zurich 
the overall decor felt dated ( with marble and gold in the bathroom 
some of the best pastries outside of france 
on hotel side of river there are western catering restaurants 
bed was really good 
an uninspiring 1960s building on one of zurich 's dullest streets does not 
we stayed for two nights and were very happy although we noticed that much of the staff did not seem 
the bathroom is small and has a smell after you flush 
higher floors will have better views 
the great buffet they offer on 1st floor 
i will definitely be staying at this property on my next visit to chengdu 
escorted me to the reception and promptly checked me in 
with the harbor view on as high a floor as possible 
so top location 
try to get a corner room on a high floor for a breathtaking view 
the hotel room is very nice 
we stayed in a suite which was very spacious but the furniture looked dated and tired 
there 's some good restaurants in the hotel too 
we found the check in staff who dealt with us to be friendly and polite and they even upgraded us 
located at the convention centre with nearby shops and restaurants 
request a high floor and river view room if possible 
the restaurants are great 
the horizon club lounge is very good with a good choice of nibbles etc and the staff were very 
the electrical switches does not boosts those modern touch panel system by one 's bed 
but in the chinese way the legendary shangri-la attention to quality and detail is absent 
its for each traveller a personal decision if they find it worth to go for club floor rooms ( provided 
good veg options in breakfastminus- very crowded breakfast area- lack of cleanliness in rooms or 
room extraordinary in its size and functionality 
it 's entirely walkable to from downtown 
very nice hotel on property 
the hotel is directly attached to a shopping mall so the elevator only goes to from the reception 
located near the station 
given the ongoing construction noise issues 
i would certainly consider staying here next time 
to walk past 8 free tables at the pool restaurant only to be told by the bar attendee that 
we managed to pick up this hotel at a great price online 
large tub and nice soaps 
really annoying are the lack of elevators to get you to your room 
we had room 243 with a smallish balcony overlooking the lawn and beach 
it is a great hotel and we enjoyed that short night and the steaks in the restaurant attached to 
the hotel had a conference on when we arrived and was full 
nice bathroom with all the facilities you need 
distance to red light district is shorter 
they gave us free drinks at the bar until the room was ready ( pina coladas yum 
samui has zero high-rise resorts 
80 's music plays constantly in all common areas of lobby 
the beach is pretty nice and its always on low tie in the evening and you can walk miles and 
free coffee and snacks during the day at the lobby 
best hotel in hk best service oriented staff 
with good water pressure 
the roof top bar was lovely although the drinks a little expensive 
on the next day i managed to take the right bus and alighted at the landmark 
taxi from airport cost 700baht and the return cost just 500 
generally friendly and helpful staff 
which meant that i had free 90s music blasting into my room even with the balcony door closed on 
the room is good 
there is a handy free shuttle bus to narita airport 
check in on the 4th floor lobby was smooth and friendly 
the coffee is good and can be done takeaway 
would definitely stay again and would take the kids next time 
the tour desk can organise several tours if you need 
the top floor restaurant serves a fabulous breakfast while enjoying panoramic views on new york 
with decent bathrooms outfitted with nice amenities ( including quality shampoos and soaps ) 
the condition of the room was terrible and the service was the worst of the worst 
the shuttle was also free 
the third night we took the bulla bus to the marina where there are several eateries which 
while the service was fairly haphazard the pub grub good was perfectly fine 
the late night food was fairly high standard and the kitchen open until 12 
beautiful hotel 
we had a late checkout but our keys did n't work - so that was a bit of a 
the bar is also nice 
- great shopping mall with various eating options nearby and a good supermarket too 
we had lots of space very handy when traveling with a two year old 
room was superb and well equipped 
if you fancy about shopping 
the pool area looked lovely and the coffee shop in the foyer very handy for a quick snack 
the hotel is very nice but really not worth the money 
if you like staying at sofitel hotels because of their reputation for high standards 
the train station was next door to the hotel too 
room was good size but needs some upgrading 
decent upmarket decor 
this is fundamentally a good hotel but it is too big for it 's own good 
50 and even in the shop in yosemite valley ( where you 'd expect higher prices ) 
the dining area was pleasant and the meals of good quality 
eat in the park . 
the sofitel bed was as good as always 
furniture tired 
the accommodation is basic even though highly priced 
some rooms have great views on the harbour and the fantastic buildings of central and causeway bay but the 
very easy access to yosemite valley 
also it is very close to the old town to roam around 
it is placed at the local bus station and is accessible to tour coaches unlike many other city centre locations 
in which case your headed to just the right place . 
breakfast in the lounge was decent as well but i was hoping there would me more peruvian choices 
the hotel itself is comfortable with an abundant breakfast 
fantastic view across the harbour and friendly staff all round 
fast internet and good service 
the public areas were spacious and airy but were quite crowded 
just a lovely property 
but they do not put all the basic toiletries in the room and you have to ask for them 
helpful staff 
the front desk was more interested in selling me their ( overpriced ) breakfast and forgot to give me 
there is a nice bar and pool area 
very central so easy to walk everywhere 
and it 's so great to have such a green place as happy vally in city center 
this property is a gorgeous addition to the lima skyline 
separate bath and shower 
the tub was fantastic although the stopper would not go properly back in 
hotel pools were excellent clean warm and with good variety 
hotel uses a real nice spa 1 mile down the road 
lot of marriott hotel put us concierge floor since it is one of benefit that promisedclub 
no resort fee and low rate is a plus but then this is no resort and the low rate was 
paid a heavy price for the same 
i will give the hotel good rate as the service was really good the bedding was great the free 
early checking in - automation said it would accommodate the hotel said they could 
especially based on the very high cost of the accommodation 
bus and the hotel provide shuttle bus to take us to many places 
but only near the window 
the location of the hotel was also great as it was close to great restaurants and shops 
but on a par with the best restaurants in london or new york 
beautiful location right on the beach and there were also plenty of sunbeds available round the pool 
this hotel seems very tired and old but if you are looking for a reasonable price hotel then this is 
i did fou nd it rather dark and to cold bathroom 
superb . 
the in room dining menu was comprehensive and i enjoyed a good breakfast 
the place is old but staff are welcoming 
the bath room is a bit small 
a floor higher would have been better 
no non smoking zone and people even smoke in the elevators 
front desk joe wong was helpful 
the road outside the taj view rooms is a dual carriageway and 
six being in the main grande praca area of the mgm grand while the rest are located 
very dusty very polluted city 
we saw guests openly smoked outside the lift lobby on our floor 
it was my first time staying on a hong kong island 
i was courteously greeted by the front desk staff and following formalities 
wonderful typical chinese hotel 
it was pretty dark when we arrived so we got to sleep in the most comfortable bed and the next 
and they use this stiff bamboo type of sweeper where you can hear it quite loud outside the room 
the spa is excellent both in facilities and the therapists 
all the staff are exceptionally helpful 
the valet parking is expensive around 39 for the day but that 's to be expected for any 
the separate lounge area to the bedroom 
i would only have softer mattresses 
pretty much all i wanted was a good nights sleep 
being ihg members we were very lucky to be able to stay at the kimpton for 
rooms are aged although enjoy a view over the pool - the pool is the highlight of the hotel 
the sweet girl at the coffee bar shop is a delight 
two sinks on opposite sides also leave ample space for you and your partner to get ready 
the bed is hard and well equipped with foam pillows you can order in advance 
the on-site bar and restaurant are worth a visit in their own right 
friendly staff 
but it is clean and the bed is comfortable 
the japanese restaurants in little tokyo next to this hotel provided a wellcome relief 
as others have said the mattress is a bit hard 
the bath was one the largest i had ever seen and could easily have had four people in it at 
she also arranged for a complimentary breakfast at the exquisite hotel bar restaurant on ground level 
this is a large property yet never felt crowded 
located near the main train station to moscow 
the bathroom was huge with separate bathtub and shower as well as excellent amenities 
towels are high quality 
convenient good location and standardsnot as fancy as the original mandarin orientalgood breakfasts 
the roof top views and pool are still fabulous 
fashion and retail stores 
bathroom just the right size 
rooftop pool very nice but only 11 sun loungers 
big beds and a new lcd tv 
the receptionist provides great information about florence and gave us a city map 
there was a total commitment to making our stay special and to making us feel like we were only guests 
hotel in front of a big mall 
well maintained and beautifully decorated 
downside - rooms faces office blocks or other buildings which is a norm in super crowded hong k 
enormous bathroom with large round tub 
there is no conventioonal mini bar but you can buy a whole mini bar package 
i had asked someone at the front desk to look into a matter for me and after saying she would 
a nice touch 
the lobby is reminiscent of classy european hotels where all you have is the reception desk and a 
microwave and large fridge - no mini bar but a minibar package available at reception 
easy secure parking 
will only return if preferred options are not available and because there are some good restaurants very close by 
this place has the ideal location for public transport 
the last visit being in may of 2015 
loading and unloading was difficult on the busy street so it must be done efficiently 
the bathroom was large and spotless 
all i need for a business stay is a quiet dark room and decent shower and this hotel offers neither 
this makes it particularly convenient because you can access different lines depending on your destination 
excellent views over central station and the city 
the duty manager was kind enough to upgrade my room the next night and the second room was much better 
this is primarily because most toilets there are powered by electricity are are extremely high tech , get your 
booked a twin room for nights and the price was reasonable 
and numerous restaurants 
this is a standard hilton hotel though above average compared to us and most european properties 
you can have excellent breakfast at kitchen and exceptional services at club lounge in evening happy hours 
with both of these options you can be downtown in 45 minutes once you get on the buses 
but we were lucky because there was a free shuttle bus-service to ruth 's steak house in 
i have had very early flights and the free shuttle runs every 20 min and it takes maybe 10 min 
the personal coaches and the spa of course 
try the fox and anchor next door great pub and food 
and secure parking 
the hotel is in a quiet square 
best hotel in deira modern and 5 star hotel in deira . 
eating options are many and good quality 
i am not sure why the hilton brand is rated so high and yet they have the worst hotels 
it was clean and bed was firm 
also convenient was coffee shop 
three computers and a copier printer are available for guests 
but the very dark decor and lighting 
you can also take the limo outside rosen center for very reasonable price 
20 minute later i go down to the front desk and waited until they handed me one 
there are so many wonderful hotels in orlando 
was spotless and had extra toiletries 
there is a small restaurant ( food is ok 
this holiday inn has a beautiful lobby and a nice rooftop swimming pool 
staff are friendly and welcoming and the rooms were spotlessly clean and a decent size for london 
all the decor was in good order and well kept 
just a perfect property for business or leisure 
the laundry service was very efficient - if you give it in by 9am you get it by 7 
the lobby is good and looks classy 
with all amenities and good linen 
the room was really nice 
the 6th floor room was excellent 
the bathroom had a supply of toiletries and fresh fluffy towels 
its only a 10 min drive down to the centre of palma and about a 15 min drive to 
outdoor pools were the perfect temperature 
it made waiting for the lift more difficult as could be heard on every floor and was hard to distinguish 
especially at the front desk and pool 
main issue was the elevator system for floors 40 and above-only 4 elevators were very insufficient 
impressive foyer 
it will automatically charge us immediately after we remove the drinks 
the separate shower stall was very large and water pressure was impressive 
food at the club lounge was adequate but privacy is assured 
to the unexpectedly grand old toilet off the reception 
the upper level is useful for a business meeting in your room 
a lot of quality for your money 
the conrad is complete and very stylish renovation of the old embassy suites property 
very large and comfortable with separate seating area and a large rotating lcd so that it could be viewed 
the rooms were large and clean and the conference facilities satisfactory 
uber high priced accommodations 
the conrad 's entrance is an expansive 
when you pay 300-500 night for a room i think the service should be much more than i 
we also visited the highline park which is amazing and we had lunch at the ritz carl 
the pool bar with a live performers makes this little hotel feel like you 're in a resort 
someone said that the two hotels were close by 
the gentlemen at reception was incredibly welcoming and professional 
rooms facing the pool is nice but it can be noisy 
a good safe 
good blinds at the windows and were untroubled by noise outside during our stay 
the bathroom and shower are separate and the shower literally opens onto the hallway ( i 
you can just switch off and leave the balcony door open 
suggest a high floor and if you can get a river view that is good 
centrally located with easy transportation for commuting 
one thing about the living room it smelled like ammonia 
the shower water pressure was good and the water ran hot very quickly 
good value basic tourist hotel in a great location for exploring all of the major attractions in central london 
the hotel is a good quality option while in adelaide 
having had a very long haul flight and exhausted not sure what to do 
i will return at more appropriate timing and see how staff react as well to determine if the checkout queue 
i went to the front desk to just do my regular check and i was told that someone have already 
fast wifi 
waterloo station ( rail and underground ) is about 5 minutes walk away 
ric the concierge car valet took good care of us and made sure our car was out 
nice bathtub and separate shower room 
i needed a hotel for the night between arriving in hong kong in the evening and leaving for 
the bed and linens are comfortable 
i stayed last time 2 years ago and my experience was goodso i booked the hotel again for my 
even myself alone found the bed very small 
staff is kind but not good trained 
the balcony room i had was great with a huge shower and seperate large bath 
breakfast was also a little disappointment 
the staff were dressed to impress and the service was slick 
the hotel is ideally situated with pubs and restaurants aplenty nearby 
with its own sandy beach 
free dry cleaning 
the staff were very helpful 
again whilst pricey was very goodi 'll be back 
which come up with free minibar items which is a good treat 
hdtv and nice access to restaurants businesses in downtown area 
good prices at the bar and pleasant staff 
that shallow tub that 's too small for a real bath but just large to make you think it 
the hotel is an easy 45 minute connection from the airport using the airport express train free connecting shuttle bus 
the second time i went to the swimming-pool and sauna there were no clean towels 
i would n't stay here if i was staying longer than one night 
first class service 
explained to us in detail on how to get the best of the city and provided us with a 
the reception staff were excellent 
breakfast i found unimpressive . 
this is a beautiful city and worth a visit 
located very centrally in tst with great restaurants surrounding it 
spacious room and great service 
rooms were decently sized for hk 
the internet was free and fast enough ( although not fantastic ) and there was a good bf with 
get high floor 
would prefer to stay in kowloon next time 
plus point is that taking a21 city liner bus from the airport is so convenient as it stops at 
so this hotel is good if you just use it as bed to sleep at night and go out most 
comfortable bed it 's just a really good hotel 
nice garden - unfriendly staff 
great staff-especially the executive club lounge , the bell boys and house keeping great servicei must 
this hotel is connected to a shopping mall with a wide range of dining options ranging from quick and cheap 
free wi-fi and a socket next to the mirror to use the hair dryer 
nice large comfortable double bed and excellent black out curtains 
will stay here again when next in joburg . 
accommodation in johannesburg is really spread out so the hotels are in different 
our first front desk person did not know how to check us in 
i would have liked to be able to open the windows but they were all key-locked 
and we were delighted to find this to be an excellent and reasonably priced one for the category 
hotel was nice and staff friendly 
despite a few niggles because the rooms are finished to a high quality and the staff are very 
my husband had to go back to the front desk to resolve after my 10 hour flight 
we would come back here on our next trip to zurich 
however i would like to commend the front desk staff ( who are great ) 
which is not convenient to most attractions 
swimming pool is clean and well maintained as well 
the breakfast buffet is excellent 
the facilities excellent and the service non-invading 
had a pleasant stay and all of the staff are very friendly 
the breakfast is good and the bar nice 
the breakfast selection is adequate and the food itself is okay 
and we could sort of see time square area but the bedroom looked right into a concrete wall 
was greeted very warmly by front desk staff 
rooms are a bit small . 
with great quality fittings and modern and minimalist colour scheme 
the check-in experience was made better with immediate access to the lounge whilst the hotel staff ensured the 
the aspects that pushed this place above the rest are the offerings on the mezzanine floor which 
no warm inviting decor 
we do however commend the high quality of service extended to us by a front desk staff name carlo 
had some fine japanese sake and whisky 75upgrade to high floor 
the staff were very nice 
a big lounge tv room in the 2 bed apartment and a good sized balcony 
we enjoyed our stay at this marriott hotel -- good quality and spacious rooms 
for those visitors looking for shopping and the quirky bars around emerald hill this hotel would be a good 
after some negotiation we agreed on a twin bedded room same as internet rate 
a free bus runs frequently from shinagawa station to the hotel 
the room was very clean and has a huge space for our little ones to run around 
a short walking distance away from the bustling gran via shopping street and we were transported to a cosy 
see if they are larger and worth the price difference 
there are much better hotels at similar prices 
with very few facilities nearby 
either for more comfort or a better price 
you can get a decent price via hotwire or agoda 
the rooms were old 
it felt like a really cool area judging by the shops and people walking about 
our fruit platter consisted of 2 bananas and 2 apples and was delivered on the third day of our 
what i can saythe location is topnear by the famous orchard roadthe staff is ok 
the hot water pressure in our room is weak 
decent food 
the pools are great in that there is one for kids as well as a whirlpool and an 
the public areas are great and breakfast in the morning was really excellent with such a nice selection and served 
the hotel lobby and restaurant is very modern 
the decoration is also very attractive 
the hotel was a 7-10 minute walk down to orchard road which was really convenient as we 
unfortunately none of these requests were granted- we had a nice suite with separate bedroom and sitting room 
fantastic location ! 
ours also had an outdoor balcony 
we also received complimentary fruit bowl 
the lobby was attractive 
there is free wifi 
food is served in the open lobby area bar 
their lounge is comfortable and elegant 
but none in the immediate area 
the location is perfect for central milan 
reasonable prices 
the hotel is very new with modern rooms 
the buffet breakfast was excellent and offered a good variety of food 
dinner in the hotel restaurant was rather mediocre 
from experience we know that although good the breakfasts are very expensive for our small appetite 
the bathroom was a really good size too with 2 basins and generous counter tops plus an unusually large 
the pool at the hotel is good to keep you cool 
so the rooms very a great deal 
it was so beautiful new and modern in a beautiful old building really well located 
higher floor rooms are quieter - stair only access to the penthouse floor - be aware 
try the spa and get the view from the spa and also from the bar at the top floor 
) i did n't want to be the drunk bearded guy creating a scene at the front desk at 
one of best hotels i have every stayed 
spacious and well equipped rooms and excellent food 
then after 45 minute i shouted at him and he went inside and came back again stating the room is 
the showers are excellent and the bathrooms have dual sinks 
very nice view from the top of the building 
the owner has given his personal touch to ensure high quality and delivery to customers as he is often seen 
the room is large and the club lounge is just perfect 
the rooms are hi-tech and everything works with remote controlbreakfast qite satisfactory and internet available 
very welcoming and good service 
i was impressed by the service 
business hotel with some great views of canary wharf 
my room was on the 4th floor 430 good view and not too far from main areas 
last visit 
just a very short walk to arena out of the side door 
that 's amateurish at prices like this 
the concierge communicated with you by sending a fax to your personal printer 
i was so sad we only stayed for 2 nights 
ltd facilities onground 
we also had a long standing booking at the hotel spa 
the tea and coffee were served out of the sort of dispensers you get in hotels when you go 
used dishes were left uncleared and service was slow 
booked the 3 day accommodation and food package for a special occasion 
but looking tired and dated - if the room was priced at 350 you 'd say it 's 
clean and comfortable and we had a lovely balcony that overlooked the old city walls 
the checkout was smooth 
with great customer service 
we stayed there for two nights and it is as billed by the folks who have stayed there in the 
lovely outside seating area and gardens are well kept 
the room is well equipped and a c works to your selected temperature with great precision 
i liked the fact that all international calls placed on their voipwere free of charge 
it had a nice view through to the water and a large balcony 
their senior managers rahul ( head chef ) and siddharth ( head of restaurants ) 
the gym was very well-appointed and had great views looking out over the water 
quiet pool and nice room service 
i do n't know if it has a new general manager ( a fax sent to the gm 
my first visit to asia 
but heating vents directly over the equipment is a bit much- room decor in the sleeping rooms is stereotypical 
the best of the best i have stayed at most of the peninsula hotels around the world and the h 
the service is personalised and nothing is too much trouble 
reclining chair and a big led tv and a spacious bathroom with bath tub 
the lighting here is also very good- dimmers on almost all switches 
comfortable stay had two back to back stays at the westin , pune . 
rooms on the higher floors have a nice view 
service was helpful and our room service breakfast 
we were lucky we actually got another good hotel but we were also fortunate as it was almost full 
the hotel has a large lobby 
the buffet was excellent 
went to bar to purchase bottled water 
their breakfast buffet lacks nothing and the wait staff is magnificent 
if you want to experience true luxury and service than this is it 
we liked the hotel . 
i stayed here for a couple of nights on a work trip and was quite disappointed in a quality of 
a beautiful historic grand hotel in a fabulous location 
light lunch i had was fine 
it handles large tour groups 
one of the best hotels of the world 
otherwise perfect to that point . 
thande hotel bagan is a nice resort 
the old building with dedication to the visit of future king edward appears permanently closed 
but with enormous bathrooms 
what i did find odd though was the colour scheme - unflattering 
take your time to read both the positive and negative reviews and make sure to read the management responses 
comfortable & stylish business hotel 
close to british museum and british library and to some good restaurants 
the hotel was built in the early 80 's as an upscale resort-y hotel and is located 
solid choice in quiet area 
and that is very convenient for the foreigh travellers like us 
wifi is extra and there is limited bathroom amenities given 
- decent location- allowed me to keep luggage in storage for the whole day after check-outdis 
i was confused that the downstairs area was full of teenagers and students on laptops and computers 
grand entrance 
the rooms are small but very well designed and the sleep quality is great 
the room is to the small side but its central london and considered such a great value 
hotel is attached to terminal 2 and you can literally walk into the lobby of the hotel from the 
the conference hall is awesome and the plentiful supply of mineral water very welcome 
piccadilly all easy to walk to 
the staff are helpful and the food has a good selection 
the receptionist was friendly 
of all things ) and it was definitely worth the price and wait ( quite busy because of the arts 
mini bar and trouser press with a good amount of room 
swimming pool was magnificent and the perfect spot to retire at the beginning or end of your day 
design is funky but utilitarian and balconies a very nice plus 
- beautiful layout strikes you as your taxi pulls into the entrance the first time- attentive staff at check 
it 's a nice treat to take the boat to town where you can shop or go sightseeing 
lots of fine eating options if you want to have a sandwich by the pool or have diner 
it is located over a shopping mall and mtr station ( both of which you are oblivious to ) 
which was well appointed with all the usual amenities that one would expect for a 5 star hotel 
the pool was large and although it was fairly busy when we were there 
and a lobby cafe where you can enjoy high tea in the afternoon 
there was a small balcony with partial view of the river 
there is a free frequent shuttle service but there can be a queue for it in the mornings going to 
avarage this hotel is good in both cases either you are transiting in barcelona and you 
the rooms were as beautiful as ever 
there is an outside pool 
wonderful rooms 
we had 3 rooms booked and after being transferred by the hotel from the airport only 2 rooms were available 
a large shopping and eating area bordering the river 
the hotel right next to the river is a fantastic oasis from the hustle and bustle of 
and the bellhop was most helpful in telling the taxi driver where you are going to in cantones 
the only complaint i have is about the food and beverage department 
i just wish they would open a little earlier since we were trying to get to bed early 
the design of the room and bath room is very 80s 90s and there is no separate shower 
the hotel location is fine and the overall property design is interesting and works for the most part except the 
after 20 minutes we went back to desk and they said 
besides being very old , there 's no shower stall . 
would have given 5 stars if the shower had n't run out of water and the breakfast had been 
shangri la always deliver top quality and service and the hong kong shangri la 
the lobster bar is a hub of activity and has a good outside area to people watch 
breakfast buffet and all its restaurants are fantastic and the location also cant be beat as it is next 
great facilities and friendly staff considering the size 
many lovely restaurants 
ok location on river 
with champagne flowing and lovely snacks etc 
ran frequently enough and cold towels were a bonus 
villa area unlike the new resorts is a bigger area - so it was like coming to paradise 
really comfortable lounge with large 
the boat transfer was seamless and very well organised and if you want to shop or party in bangkok 
the bar is busier early evening and later evening activity tended to focus on the neighbouring angsana 
they 've got this strange little pool-side restaurant that serves food and drink during the day 
overall a good experience but with newer hotels available in hk at this class you may want to 
the bed is so soft and so easy to sleep in 
central is an easy walk or you can catch the mtr or do it like the locals and hop 
however it was kept clean and there were some interesting touches like a gun-operated lamp ( very 
it 's near the olympic village and the famous bird 's nest 
excellent bed mattress and a very nice bathroom 
i 've stayed at other hotels that have little signs in non-smoking rooms mentioning that there is 
really nice for the price 
the room was nicely appointed and had all the necessary amenities and furniture in excellent condition 
nthis was only a short trip but we will be back for a longer stay in the not too 
room and facilities in a very convenient location 
so if you want to be away from the crowd , it is a good place . 
the hotel faces the beach and some amazing shops eateries 
not great in space 
the amenities aresatisfactory with a good exercise room equipped with free-weights and cardio-m 
excellent check in stafflovely lovely rooms 
the welcome tea and fruits were nice 
the furniture and d cor are from the 1970s , and the breakfast buffet never changes ( we 
pool is small but beautiful - ok to chill around - beach really close 
the concierge had a poor knowledge of the area 
near one of the nicest beaches you will ever find 
personnel is really nice and willing to help 
nothing was too much trouble for evi ichie who is a super star . 
best location in jerusalem 
we were a bit disappointed at the pool side restaurant though during dinner 
we could not believe they want to pull down the nice building in favor of a skyscraper 
secluded getaway this was christmas time and after a prolong treatment at their spa , which by 
) the property is beautiful and original 
in the realm of barefoot-luxury 
wireless broadband was available for 40 per hour ( 2 
this was my second trip to the okura in the past twelve months and again it was enjoyable 
bathroom has a bathtub but no separate shower room 
some rooms have beach view overlooking doha skyline and ask for a room near reception if you mind walking 
the pool area is good and the 25 mtr pool is spotless and well maintained 
food was very tasty and there were clean bathroom facilities 
jaded - nice common areas 
downside its on the flight path and can be a bit noisy but do n't let that put you 
especially the floors are very bad and you get hit by static charge electric shocks 
and of course really close to the airport - for better and for worse 
especially the main lobby 
we checked out the swimming pool and the kids were a bit disappointed with the design of the swimming pool 
at first it is a nit odd to have to knock on the door to be let in but they 
hotwire allocated this hotel to me for about half the price of the advertised hotel rates 
this was our first visit to hong kong for several years and our stay coincided with chinese 
the decor is dated in the rooms but it has a quaintness and are certainly very comfortable 
- lobby is large and tasteless 
the smell of smoke of strong throughout the hotel and there was hallway and adjacenbt room noise 
the service was amazing and the room amenities were quality products ( at the time it was l'occ 
this last time this happened i bought one form the apple shop in ginza 
not long enough to soak up the amazing ambience of this old world 
the service is good enough ( as in all japan ) 
try to get a harbour view room as well - the view is spectacular . 
my only complaint ( and a minor one at that ) was that the restaurants do n't open until 
it 's a wonderful property in the heart of hk 
i was able to get in contact with the hotel to set everything up and ask some tourist related questions 
the lobby is stunning by its size -truly unique for tokyo 
location was perfect in this stunning little town 
there are numerous dining and drinking options in the hotel and many other options in the neighborhood 
although not as nice as the new beds pillows that the international chains have been rolling out over the 
our room was cleaned when we left for breakfast everyday as if they were monitoring our movements 
the rooms are very comfortable and a very friendly staff 
the concierge was super helpful in directing me to file a police station ( where more english spoken 
the immediate area is relatively quiet 
breakfast buffet was substantial and served downstairs in the restaurant with a choice of inside or outside seating 
one small sink and a deep but short bath 
which is the major touristic hub and the heart of dubrovnik 
korean restaurant 
this is a belated review of my may visit 
the pluses of the hotel are the quaint bercy neighborhood with good restaurants and some interesting shops 
this is an amazing building 
the rooms were very clean and the housekeepers were kind enough to clean the rooms twice daily as we 
the staff is very helpful in organizing tours to normandy and how to direct you to the tour bus 
this is a good hotel for business because it 's at the cross roads for a major london 
huge hotel lobby with gorgeous view of the original foyer and arches 
we visited this hotel for a couple of nights to be close to bercy where we were attending a 
slept great as mattress quality was top of the line 
room very spacious by european standards with a lovely kingsize comfy bed 
congratulations for the friendliness of your staff 
we were picked up from the airport by the hotel bentley and the service for the whole week could 
there is a small pool 
great staff & accommodation 
the other regional train stations and underground are all within walking distance internally from the hotel 
top spa and sporty ammenities 
its an icon in london and certainly a place to visit but the price was higher than other hotels 
big bathroom and lovely balcony 
and finally the station has plenty of shops you might need including a foyles bookshop 
towels and everything you can expect from intercontinental 
rooms are old and almost no one in the hotel speak english 
we managed a quick drink in the bar and enjoyed both the drinks and the service 
the bathroom was quite large with the normal amenities and a bonus heated toilet seat 
no bath but a large walk in shower 
also a constant stream of free food and drink in the chambers club 
stayed in new wing with very nice but nondescript rooms - take it the old part has 
lux furnishings and the hotel staff is incredibly attentive 
as we had an early train to catch we ordered room service breakfast 
the hotel is very close to tokyo station ( we arrived per shinkansen from ky 
everything is within walking distance and there 's a lot to eat around the hotel 
i had visited previously with business and so we knew what to expect 
beds and pillows are comfortable allowing a good sleep 
on the 9th floor is a seafood restaurant with an extensive buffet of all things including seafood 
in an old train station is the beautiful renaissance hotel st 
neat and tidy with good reception etc 
clean room and great location 
actual rain shower was a bit limp 
location is just next to the subway station and close to causeway area 
but the reception at the hotel was kind enough to offer to write the instruction for the taxi driver in 
we had a very pleasant drink in the bar but did not eat in the restaurant--the menu looked 
none of philadelphia 's top hotels are super-appealing--perhaps because the city just does 
the views over hong kong harbour help to take your mind off the tiny room size which is 
the street outside was quiet 
the room is reasonably large in size according to tokyo standard and the service is ok 
room size is very generous when compared to most japanese hotels 
the harbor view rooms are available at an upcharge but are worth the extra cost--the view is 
the ensuite bathroom has a shower only 
the beach is nice 
skip the expensive cocktails at the pool and bring your own using the plastic cups ( not glass cups ) 
i would have given it a much better review had i not felt constantly hassled by staff to 
we were there at a slightly off time so it wasnt too crowded & we were able to get 
no free drinks 
there is a small table for two which is perfect for a computer table 
it is so sad that such a great property has been let to run down and i now understand why 
with a full kitchen 
i was offered a twin-room thus i explained i only need one bed 
breakfast is poor with limited choices but u can have a great lunch or dinner 
we pushed the double bed to the wall to make slightly more space in the double room 
nice lobby 
views onto coast and city very nice 
a special thank you to omar from front desk 
the westin treats the condo like a hotel room and staff clean 
chairs and umbrellas will cost you 
ibis meals were good 
room was nice by cuban standard with all the necessary amenities 
massive bed and balcony 
modern day hotels one finds in most cities 
what a marvelous location 
a double bed with sea view 
very good shopping in the area for all that i needed and i picked up some good clothing bargains 
front desk is good let us check in earlier 
the wifi is slow 
the spa gym facilities were absolutely one of the best we have ever seen 
could be a wonderful facility but needs some work on the basic essentials before the dakar rally rolls 
the bust cost you 40hkd one way 
the rooms are really small and the bed made of wood probably 
open their hotel room door wide with tv blaring at all hours and smoke wafting out into 
as previously mentioned it 's built out of salt bricks and for that alone it 's worth staying 
there are some great traditional restaurants close by 
the only negative is that the hotel is not particularly close to the tourist attractions but that made for a 
you have some nice options with more convenient locations for a walk tour downtown but if you like 
5mins walk to oxford street and 2mins to good places for breakfast 
the power outlets do n't work ( except one ) which is inconvenient to today 's business traveller 
mini bar area with hot water kettles 
a request ( from a marriott platinium ) for a room with a view is met with 
the executive lounge is well worth the cost 
the breakfast buffet offered good choice but most of it were malaysian food 
one had a broken toilet flush while the other has a dead air-conditioning system 
huge bathrooms 
somebody took this old hotel and converted it into a trendy 
food trays unfilled for a while 
room sizes are small but not a major obstace 
uptown chic boutique hotel right in old town 
very helpful staff - especially irma 
the zaza valet staff has superbly talented parkers 
my room had a shower right in the middle of the room 
this is a modern facility in jodhpur 's old city 
had a nice dinner at maze 
our room had a roof top terrace which we use for sundowners 
the outdoor swimming pool is located on 26th floor 
one time i was told that i was being upgraded to one of the recently renovated rooms 
room is huge with nice views and spacious bathroom with big shower stall n bath tub 
a lot of london hotels are huge and impersonal with gangs of men hanging around in the lobby 
spa is also lovely but prices here were more expensive than the same spa services at the ober 
though rooms were l 'll small but very neat n clean 
people at breakfast service is amazing 
the fitness center is nice - there are lots of equipment and one can see a great view of the 
sleeping quality was excellent once i have turned off the a c ( that was a bit loud even 
wifi free of charge 
there are two restaurants in the hotel which offer very good options at very good price 
as are the restaurants on top - the famous sky bar and a really nice tapas restaurant one level 
who gave us brilliant tips about the restaurants in and around the city and the room service staff 
the gym attendant was amazing 
breakfast is good with a choice of hot and cold dishes 
and i did not understand how the light in bathroom works 
astoria is very good value for lunch 
noisy and generally full of locals and chinese which means there is no quiet area by the main 
this is such a lovely accommodation -- it was really a treat to stay here 
the footprint of the building is an odd shape sort of like a figure 8 
the bed was very comfortable and bathroom was clean with nice amenities 
it is right in the middle of town and is walking distance to all the great shops and restaurants 
a good choice if breakfast options available together with soft drinks all day 
easy 20 min walkalong victoria harbour to harbour city for great shopping 
with its famous round bath tub and good pressured rain shower 
the club floor is a must to try out 
etc ) - its a 5 minute walk to isetan and about 10 minute walk to platinum- 
my husnand checks in to this hotel almost weekly for business trip and thus recommended this hotel when 
the gym is smallish and next to the smallish pool 
the gym is amazing so much space 
food quality is also very good but i think the staff training still needs some improvement 
very busy convention hotel 
plenty of restaurants and prices at the stores were reasonable instead of just high end brands although 
standard rooms are hugewith white marble tubs and separate showers and universal adapters 
the lobby is spacious but very busy 
housekeeping can do better in cleaning the post-construction residue 
along with complementary high tea for everyday of your stay 
the rooms are more spacious than other regular hotels' and the bathrooms are bigger 
the location is good the hotel is connected to central world mall 
good reception quality 
they had such a wide range for breakfast and will recommend if you have time for a long breakfast 
but also the old furniture and carpet on the fllor give to the hotel a very warm sensation 
but front desk well staffed 
there was a very efficient laundry service 
- the fitness ctr was open early and each treadmill had it 's own dedicated tv and headphones 
try going to the hotel lobby with your trolley or luggage 
the concierge desk was very helpful during my stay 
there was live music in the 2 restaurants and lower lobby area outside the mangrove bar 
the taste was nothing special but the price was too expensive 
we had a nice room 
we had nice views of the river and the pulteney bridge and the bathroom had very good 
the only thing is the room key didn t work properly ! 
the breakfast was good - a buffet with really good choices of hot and cold 
the self service breakfast was fine but the evening meal we had was at well below the standard one would 
better rates there and higher quality of service 
did n't regret it . 
old hotel release different scenery because of the people inside 
breakfast was good and service staff friendly 
the lobby is a mess ( during checking in & out ) 
no fridge or mini bar which is odd for a hilton 
the pool area is small but i found it a great spot to relax in the afternoon sun 
after a tiring and bitter cold day outdoors 
comfortable with windows facing the front 
literally in the centre a stones throw from historic sights and great shopping and dining 
our room was a decent size and they had a good breakfast 
location is close to shopping and many good restaurants 
concierge and front desk were very helpful 
i return this wednesday for a thursday flight back to the us - hope they are generous again 
historic property with comfortable rooms and excellent service 
the building itself is great and the location superb 
but this is again one of those old hotels that have been renovated to charge higher 
all the rooms are good 
probably opt for a hotel with rooms better suited to work 
although a separate shower is missing 
i was probably lucky as was upgraded to a better corner room and got some nice extras 
so convenient to good restaurants and shops as well as to watch the symphony of lights at night 
i 'm not a fan of the red marble 
though just a short walk from the linjiang street night market 
deco is a little old fashioned but bathroom size is good and everything works fine 
comfortable beds and clean bathroom 
again a good 15 mins walk 
she ran an extremely busy open kitchen like a seasoned veteran 
although rooms were decent 
one of best hotel in hong kong 
in the center of town and only 15 minutes from the taipei songshan airport 
there are many better hotels to consider in taipei 
good location 
i was disappointed with my room which had a large lobby but a small sleeping area 
the looby area seem to be smaller for a five star hotelthe cofee shop in the r 
the far eastern has a great roof-top pool with a breath-taking view of the city 
which means inevitable outside noise 
not to mention the wonderful city of rotterdam itself 
lovely foyer etc 
but nicely fitted out with large double bed 
love the free wifi and location was great 
had one of the newly refurbished rooms on a standard floor 
club lounge is also great 
very nice breakfast 
the shang has an awesome roof top pool as well and i like the location on an he r 
i stayed here for 4 nights as i was staying for a conference at the nearby shrangri la 
a real mixed review as we had a great time here but we found out quite quickly that tai 
the property is very close to many restaurants and shopping 
the extra cost is money well spent 
this was disappointing given the price already paid and the stay happened to coincide with my birthday 
anything facing the water and on high floors would give you a spectacular view 
the mall connected to this hotel has got nothing going for it 
for a total of 9 nights 
higher floor for better view 
a very nice stay 
even the bell boy was very anxious to tell us the location of all the tourist attraction points and the 
the room was good size with a large glass window with the view of taipei 101 
ms carmen yeung guest experience manager was so sensitive and good that she made us comfortable with late 
this is the best hotel you can get in taipei 
had new years eve dinner at the chinese restaurant downstairs in the hotel and it was fantastic 
ok for value i say look around first it 's located in station 1 quiet and about 40 min 
the bathroom was large and had great amenities 
overall if you consider the trademark hospitality of the intercontinental brand as a deciding factor in making your 
there was a food court situated in the shopping mall next to the hotel 
the hotel has a face lift in recent years so rooms are all refurnished with a contemporary design 
enjoyed a beautifull time in the city with astonishing view of the 101 tower 
i have stayed at many top branded hotels in taipei but i found that this hotel provides excellent 
although no more full sea view , yet the overall feeling is more quiet and peaceful . 
rooms on the west side of the higher floors have a fabulous view over the wtc site 
the manager was exceptionally helpful and even helped personally with my late night room service 
across the street is the main pedestrian zone newly renovated rooms are up to 5 star standard 
the restaurant on the 3rd floor served a good value dinner and a good morning buffet 
i have not yet got to the roof top bar or pool 
stained carpet and old furniture ( it looks like a normal b&b room from the picture ) 
breakfast was lovely and delicious and at evening open lounge bar was a heaven with lots of cocktails and 
order room service twice 
and easy access to anywhere 
service is top notch 
st regis is a significantly larger property 
one of the first international hotels in chengdu 
i should tell that this is a very nice property with great locational advantages 
the double bed will have a bedside light on only the one side 
the hotel is very close to the market st east station and you can use the train to and from 
, were all lovely -- just what you would expect from rc . 
we had an outstanding stay over a saturday night 
the only good things that stood out was that they wished me happy birthday and there was a nice birthday 
but would like to try out the hgi near times squares next time as full breakfasts are 
and the quality of the room was only so so ( no wi fi ) etc 
room size v good and i had phenomenal views of 9 11 memorial 
make sure you have lunch poolside and you check out the on premise restaurants 
i raised my concerns to the front desk who promised to address this and in return provided me with late 
the spa is very nice 
i found the price very high for what the place offered - i 've no doubt this was in 
but the suite was an excellent size and in good decorative order 
higher floors have best views 
room service was quick but while serving my food the server took a call on his cell phone and did 
the lobby is small compact and the staff serve vry efficiently 
the hotel was very convenient to the east village and lower east side thanks to the subway and even walking 
nothing from the noise in the rooms its more like a big bar than a hotellobby 
my only objections were the internet which was slow for a quality hotel and required a new logo-on 
this hotel is clean and elegant 
the location seems a little dicey after dark 
the staff is nice 
the area around the train station is a bit dead at night 
rooftop bar is a must 
despite the small drop off area in front of the hotel 
this hotel is tres mod with an extremely cool bar and nice restaurant with tasty food and a good 
in the heart of soho with easy walks to loads of hotspots and tube stations 
the rooms and the view were good and the concierge was helpful 
there 's a very protracted amount of paperwork to do at check in which even given my exalted position 
for business trips -- comfortable and classy 
we found the staff to be helpful and polite throughout our entire stay and we really were treated like special 
feel comfortable with hotel rooms that look like every motel you have ever been in 
the beds are huge and super comfortable and the general decor pleasing 
the toilet flush is as loud and forceful as an airline toilet 
the reception staff just watched us no effort made to assist 
so it is full to get upgraded but available if you pay 
the grand club has excellent staff who always remember you when you return 
the hotel is a real landmark and close to lots of restaurants and theatrers 
the gym is above average by hotel standards 
which had great lighting 
breakfast buffet at 32 is a bit pricey 
well worth the price 
as was the lobby bar with great views 
i had the chowder soup one day on the upper floor chowder shop 
the facilities barely ok and the elevators 
only minor gripe is that i think the hotel is fast approaching refurb time - but they can get 
close to downtown and public transport as well as close to the convention centre 
if you are not on the higher floors 
and even the walls were n't as thin as they stated before 
however the club room is poor with limited hours & drinks not free 
i pay to use a beach front hotel hotel facilities 
breakfast is also just a standard buffet 
with so many other expensive options in manhattan 
there is absolutely little area for vehicles to pick up or drop people 
shopping is abundant all around 
thats why i was pleasantly surprised to see this seattle property to be different 
service always arrives during my conference and the room was nice and clean 
seattle is a fantastic compact city with almost everything in walking distance 
i found this hotel to be really good with possibly the most comfortable hotel beds i have experienced 
we ate 2 breakfasts & one dinner 
00 for the buffet and the noise in my bathroom and bedrooms was not good 
breakfast is very good and lunch restaurant buffet is also excellent 
but because of the size of the hotel and the lack of atmosphere i would only come back here for 
the hotel is outdated and there is a cooking smell all over the place 
clean and amenities were fine 
the service was impecable and they went above and beyond any expectations 
the bed was comfortable however i really do n't understand those small square pillows 
the gym which is located separate to the main hotel building in large and well equipped with the latest machines 
the pool area is also lovely with plenty of day beds 
for most of mumbai 's sights it would be too far out considering the traffic . 
staff attentive and the rooms we stayed in spacious and well appointed 
the rooms are quiet of a good size 
the spa experience was wonderful with a good oil massage 
our eyes went very red and there was an overwhelming smell of chlorine 
headsets and even apples the front desk was very helpful 
naturally it lives up to the expectation of a 5 star hotel in india as one would expect 
wifi reception was good 
we do our best to find a place to stay just outside the square not right in the middle of 
th spool and bar areas are clean and remans unchanged from a few years prior 
not sure if it 's good value as the company paid 
the only staff i encountered were on reception - one girl seemed to be on duty most of my three 
all in all a wonderful hotel though quite expensive 
wroclaw seems to have plenty of choice for hotels with generally reasonable prices 
if you 've been to any of the major city sofitel hotels and expect the same high 
offers all the marriott amenities including excutive lounge 
very comfortable bed and a nice cosy room 
but all of this was lacking and we did n't want to spend our time calling everyone so we 
the pool view room is also good but the major difference is 
rude staff 
the gym is nice and large 
close to all shopping and all the nmajor locations in central 
good gym etc 
with easy access to freeway 
the service and hospitality were outstanding - and the food was unbelievably good - i did n't realise i 
biggest deception is that even on the club floor the internet is not free 
their restaurants food is better than we expect 
all are top notch establishments 
the little food cafe is a bit too sparse 
this hotel is a bit outside of old town 
spa was also very nice but pool was small 
i ordered a glass of pinot noir and they brought me a glass of merlot - and 
downsides if any - the place no longer compares with newer hotels for high impact physical surroundings 
good value and i would stay again if on business probably not if i was with friends or as a 
staff and fellow guests good fortune 
and therefore a great value for money 
my only complaint is that it 's a lot farther from everything than advertised . 
2 restaurants & a nice bar and they will book your tours for you 
pretty good budget hotel 
although the room is not very large and it can get packed at certain times 
the rooms are clean and warm 
spacious rooms with good wifi coverage in the hotel 
comfortable city hotel with great views over the vistula and the beautiful brutalist hotel forum 
first class service 
the street side is noisy 
the only one in town 
quite crowded and busy street 
the bar in the basement had an experienced staff who could make almost any cocktail 
the concierge was very helpful helping locate a hard to find kids toy that 
great bedding 
very good check in and check out 
and an excellent hub for sightseeing in osaka city 
bathroom is definitely one of the best bathroom i 've seen 
the pool area is additionally beautiful 
and the windows cannot be opened for security reason - not one tiny bit 
if you get picked up by their limo service from the airport the hotel is ready to welcome you 
but extremely crowded so hard to get around and everyone rushing as they were running late due to having to 
very convenient for central hk and shopping 
the malls and the shops of downtown 
the layout is comfortable 
the restaurants although expensive are very good 
oliver bar serves small meals and has an extensive bar menu 
as a tourist we find the location to be super and the main reason we chose the mayflower 
location is excellent - its a iconic building standing tall on you 
the windows do not open and the room never really was cool so we finally asked for a fan which 
i should add that the staff at bars is very kind and there is also a very nice italian 
spacious bathroom with separate walk in shower and bathtub with white and black color match 
the bedroom had another huge closet as well 
if you get a good rate stay in a fairmont gold room 
but i 'm not sure if that 's due to thin walls or very loud snoring 
plenty of hotels within seconds of the hotel 
comfy bed , mid size bathroom . 
the pool itself is nice and big 
hotel is an easy 10 mins walk from lime street train station and just located opposite liverpool one 
we were upgraded due to my gold card and the room itself was quite spacious and in a semi- 
it is a low rise property with a nice outdoor garden area and pavilion at the back 
the service was excellent and the amenities were very nice and pretty 
with good bath facilities and very comfortable beds 
tasty food and real flowers were all very welcome touches that went a long way to easing the discomfort 
breakfast was plentiful & taken on a verandah overlooking the hotels lovely gardens 
the staff are extremely professional and accommodating 
the guests in room next to me kept me awake all night 
it is easy to get a taxi ( the hotel staff will help you ) and just a 10- 
the little snacks that are left in the room at night 
easy access to many shops 
as the hotel accepted the booking and charged for the extra bed i did n't stop to consider its 
with nice amenities 
modernly decorated 
it was a very good hotel experience 
very quiet area 
we were a short walk to the spanish steps and a longer walk to other desirable areas of r 
the rooftop patio was just glorious for a sunset cocktail - not cheap 
beautiful palace 
nmodern with minimalist decor and excellent service and attention 
it is centrally located with many fine restaurants within easy walking distance 
very good breakfast buffet and a wide choice of restaurants with prices to match 
beautifully restored and the staff went out of their way to help with everything 
the borghese area is fantastic 
the hotel staff was very nice and helpful 
yet just a short walk to the spanish steps 
this secluded hotel resort is a great place to getaway with either a partner 
the three pools ( one lagoon style ) and the beach access 
it is easily on a par with the best five star hotels i 've experienced in paris or 
being so close to sydney my in-laws came to visit for an overnight stay because there 
first class traditional hotel 
best quality 
if you want pure luxury in the centre of cusco this is he place to stay 
from the airport where you can choose to take its vehicle to the hotel ( booth is beside the official 
service is top quality and great care is taken to please 
this sets the standard for an inner city business hotel with excellent staff 
nice resort this resort is a little unusual in that it has a large footprint around a private golf course 
captains bar has a great atmosphere at night and the cigar bar is so decadent 
not briefed about the personalised butler services available 
just a short walk to plaza de armas but breakfast was rather ordinary prompting us to dine elsewhere 
the complimentary coffee and tea ( including coca ) available near the front desk 
the buffet breakfast was quite good and the service very attentive 
the staff great and very willing to help in any way 
rooms poor value for the money 
but the food is very good 
the pool onsite is an afterthought 
nthe executive room is big enough and still has bath up 
access to the airport express train is quite inconvenient 
there is some major construction going on at the building next door to the mandarin and there is heavy 
makes one having to take water from the minibar - admittedly small 
a big shout out to the guys by the pool - exemplary service and such a delight 
this hotel equipped with gym and a bit small swimming pool ( very crowded with kids during weekend ) the 
i did n't expect big pool for family as per i said 
you are greeted with cool towels and sandals and led into your private waiting area or a private suite 
excellent service and the spa is magnificent 
he told me that my room will be ready at 2 pm 
i was also awoken in the morning by a phone call from the reception to say that breakfast was about 
got to the hotel fairly late due to flight delay 
the wifi was good 
especially when wifi and breakfast are n't typically included in the room rate 
our bedroom was large 
the bathroom was huge and had a swiveling tv embedded in the mirror 
lovely staff and great food in the hotel 
super room service - whatever we asked for - it was deliverd immediately 
huge bathroom 
good spa ( but for the best spa - you still need to go to the four seasons ) 
with quality breakfast and great dinner- conference facilities are world class and well serviced- the views are 
one of the best hotel rooms i 've ever had 
from black marble to mirrored chandeliers mixed with chinese antiquities 
this one had a makeover a couple of years ago and still benefits from it . 
lobby lounge serves decent wines and cheese 
the hotel is very good in most areas 
after conference i had an easy 15minute walk to the wharf area and booked a twilight cruise - 
we spent four days there before a cruise and our corner room was spacious 
check in was very professional and fast and same receptionist the next 3 days remembered our names and that 
great gym but pool is very small 
large spacious rooms as you would expect from crowne plaza 
stayed at the mandarin oriental in hong kong during our recent visit and the promise 
also do n't be coax 'd to accepting a room on the club floor if you value your 
there are quite a few good restaurants across the street 
maybe i was lucky that day but i had the freshest of orange juices and it was lovely 
we only used the hotel restaurant for breakfast in the morning and it was quite a good spread 
comes regularly though from hotel to airport 
in an area that is a work in progress 
this hotels exudes old world charm from its preserved lobby ( post upgrading ) to its clubby rooms 
and brass ) but a bit dated and the low ceilings make it feel a bit cramped 
but it 's quiet enough and the free shuttle bus made getting there easy 
are pure luxury and quality 
-very close ( walking distance ) to a new shopping malll- nice gym 
room was a good size ( though i think we were upgraded ) and the housekeeping did a great 
one good thing was that the toilet was separated from the bath and the sink area by a door 
i tried churchill bar on the 3rd floor it is very good one of the server is euro 
the chef on the club floor also help the guests realize how wonderful the food are and request for people 
i was at the churchchill bar and i liked the idyllic setting and took photographs of 
i did a pre-paid booking directly with the hotel 's own website and paid about dkk 
the rooms were also very clean 
there is a good desk and plenty of electricity outlets 
sat at the bar and watched the us open tennis on tv 
there is a corridor leading to a hall with elevators getting you to the lobby level 
this hotel is out in a new area of copenhagen with excellent rail transport into the city 
nice touch 
rather than pay this ridiculous price i went out in the cold and brought one from the street for 5 
what i got however was 2 x single beds so not only not upgraded but effectively downgraded 
i have stayed in better hiltons 
this hotel is like an old friend and the views from high floors are lovely 
- the subway service is close by at orestad and the ride into the central station takes less 
rooms are of a reasonable size and have all amenities including wifi tea & coffee making facilities 
view over the lake from the balcony is fantastic 
but nicely decorated with contemporary ideas 
finally made it to the hotel a day late and helpful reception staff advised me as soon as it 
gardens and the snow capped mountains 
although there were renovations underway in the hotel this did not impact on us in the least 
i wo n't hesitate to return if the price is right in the future 
if you are on the lower floors ( 23 and under ) 
lounge on the top floor offer great view of the huangpu river and the surrounding high 
as well as a pool and hot tub 
location is ok next to the cheap and cheerful four points sister hotel and less expensive shopping mall which has 
and enjoyed the convenience of having a mall nearby 
the business lounge is also very pleasant and with a great view 
the lobby is on the 15th floor with a nice but small seating area with an assortment of tables 
the front desk staff were polite and professional 
it is the best location for sightseeing and business in nyc 
check in took a long time , conciege failed to book my airport transfer . 
pleasant large business hotel with very good facilities 
we hit a little traffic 
poor quality 
the gym is nice & the spa is great 
they are not always alert & their managers have to step in to help out . 
stayed for one night iro my quick visit to shanghai 
i was a guest of the toy fair in this hotel 
thankfully this room was purchased on points as we would not pay the standard rate to stay here 
the reception is large and there are sufficient f&b offerings available at the site 
just a 7 minute walk from paddington station do if the hilton there has no rooms 
the station is quite a walk from the airport entrance so if you have luggage i would recommend taking a 
nice fitness center ( which i rate it importantly ) 
i found cigarette ashes 
the exeuctive lounge is nice but nothing is complimentary 
another bonus is that green motion car rental is in the same building just in case like us you want 
karon beach right across the street was very nice and its just a short walk to local shops 
this is a nice hotel 
being a hilton honors gold member i always get good upgrades every time 
a very special visit 
lots of childrens activities and the breakfasts are great 
the swimming pool is nice but not for swimming lengths but great for relaxing 
n nthe grounds are very beautiful and are in a perfect setting 
beautiful sweeping resort 
very rarely do i leave a bad review on ta 
breakfast buffet was a good range of food and better than most 
very clean and nice hotel rooms 
staff is helpful as usual . 
probably one of the nicest meals i have ever had anywhere followed by a cake with 25 candles 
i visited hilton phuket only for 2 nights on my business trip last year and had a 
the staff very professional 
very close to the shopping mall 
lobby area is huge 
we booked a two night package including dinner on the first night and breakfast both mornings 
finding a free lounger by the pool was next to impossible during a busy time like this 
parked in the next door ncp at 17 - adds a lot to the room cost 
interior view room was fine since most of the time room was only used for sleeping 
stopped here for 1 night whilst in thailandhotel is very large and has a number of 
very nice bathroom as well 
good space 
the concierge was very helpful and were willing to give directions 
the morning and afternoon front desk staff are basically the check-in 
and being on the 28th floor i had a great view of the city to the west that i 
the hotel is located high up in the building - you catch an elevator to level 27- so it 
they opened up an area on a floor below the normal section you would have breakfast due to the number 
it was functional rather than luxury but that is fine and it was therefore much less expensive than the ( 
beautiful and great choice though for others who do n't mind a good walk whenever they head out 
the property was high end and everything was spot on 
booked the presidential suite ( 1318 ) 
fresh orange juice 
the price was high ( more than 200 usd ) 
quite nice and reasonably priced hotel on the seven top floors of the sapia tower 
and the big bed is comfortable 
the property is located a short drive from the town but would probably take about 30 minutes to walk 
had a first floor room overlooking lawn 
annoyances--we never could get the promised free wireless as it would not connect except in the 
room was spacious with a sitting area and large flat screen tv 
this hotel delivered really high quality at a very reasonable price 
rooms are have good sized bathroom and bed is comfortable 
the bed in particular deserves special mention with a firm but not hard mattress 
excellent value i recently stayed at the metropole and was impressed with the quality of the service 
the hotel was well situated for a walk along the lake or across the bridge to old town and the 
the hotel lobby and patio are beautiful 
which has a separate lounge room 
then you walk through to the main bedroom with floor to ceiling windows and great london views 
it just a short walk to the bus to alhambra or if you are fit a good walk 
i hate to give a marriott property less than 4 stars 
bathroom was big with a shower and tub and the hotel provided fantastic toiletries 
having stayed previously the check in quick & efficient lovely size rooms and good quality as well as top location 
the hotel offers complimentary canapes and wine at 6pm 
the hotel has an area in the old historic area where people can smoke outside your and their room 
the rooms were more like an apartment and equipped with a cd player and a spectacular bath with gorgeous tile 
nice roomswell air conditionedgood breakfastbar very noisy to point of feeling we had to leave after 
we did n't find this a problem - there 's a hedge to hide from people peeking 
good resort but large 
the room itself was adequate with beds too hard and pillows too soft 
the hotel is modern with a good bar and restaurant 
the room was really lovely & had everything we needed & the toiletries were really nice too ( some 
the conference room floor is big and airy 
the pool is gigantic with lotos of loungers and there is good service around the pool 
the hotel offers free shuttle ( a very comfortable van ) from airport to hotel ( hotel - airport ) 
sofa bed was good and provided a good quality sleep 
i soldiered on and managed to try the warm dishes but the effort of bending over a coffee 
but to compensate there is a free shuttle every hour to 4 drop off pick up points in the city 
frankly when i first encountered them i thought the emergency lighting had kicked in . 
we had breakfast boxes prepared due to an early flight and they were good 
i attended large conference there and even the banquet food for 2 
reception at the restaurant was non existent we just went outside and sat down 
we 've been visiting your hotel ever since you opened something like once a week but from here on 
first feeling at the lobby is already very good 
not to mention the pools and lazy river 
pool looked great as well 
a nice lobby 
but note the hotel provides a free regular shuttle service that stops at hung hom rail station and the luxurious 
as apartments go the fixtures and fittings were good 
you will be most likely treated better than at most other hotels--the staff really ca n't be 
high quality staff is still not a given 
location - very convenient as 2 mins walk takes you to the tram stop and its in the free ride 
upon my return i asked if there was any shops nearby it being isolated and with no obvious choice 
i believe its the closet hotel to the airport and they run a frequent shuttle to from the airport 
totally not worth the price i paid ( over 400 night ) 
breakfast is unexceptional ( there are numerous restaurants in the area ) 
we were naturally pleased with the upgrade although frankly we did n't use the pool at all since it 
it is a cozy place i would suggest to pick a villa nearby the main pool . 
within 5 mins from jr station and bus station for airport express 
things have changed a lot since those bad reviews 
wireless internet access is available in the room 
we spent first 2 nights in the villas which was great 
wifi was free 
the bar was a great spot to hang out at 
there is always a car avilable to take you into town if you miss the bi-hour 
refreshing lifestyle before go back to our own busy town 
which includes a very large bathroom with a separate shower and a deep bath 
the room was big 
spacious with huge king size very comfy beds 
harbour view from top floors 
it needs around 35-45min so it 's a min point stay in odaibab 
great value 
all the staff simply amazing 
very nice toiletries in the rooms 
the infinity pool was wonderful with great lounge chairs and surrounded by greenery 
we had room service for dinner and they brought everything with them 
connected to the main city by yurokamome line 
furniture worn and service is average 
this hotel has a shuttle service to all the local malls etc for freegym and pool is all 
the main lobby makes very negative impression 
large fridge 
the lobby did n't smell like smoke 
outdoor jacuzzi 
all of them on the higher floor and got a great view of odaiba 
the hotel is well located with the daiba station only 1 minute away & surrounded by aquacity & 
and a large outdoor jacuzzi at the back 
pillows on the bed was to soft for me and i wokeup with a neckache 
hotel shuttle is very handy for getting to the mtr and local area 
every time we left or returned to our villa we had a 5 minute or more wait for transportation 
it seems to be a lovely place with excellent food and helpful 
there is a nearby seafood restaurant by the riverside as well 
our villa had a private hot spring which i highly recommend as you can h use the hot springs 
the desk staff were efficient and helpful 
i do n't like the swedish massage but i do n't think its the fault of 
staff is exceptional and service is top notch 
for sin 200 it 's better value than the others i 've stayed in 
go for the premium pool villa alto you will not likely use the pool 
best massage ever 
the resort was ok but nothing like other bt resorts such as bt phuket 
the hotel lobby lounge is located in front of the reception which i feel is a bit too open 
and there have all the standards of the best hotels 
quick friendly check in and large spacious room greets you 
also the hotel is set back from the street so even the outside rooms may not be so bad for 
stayed here during a convention so the price was quite high 
the window only opens a few inch and the air-condition diid not have the power to cool 
on a high floor with a view of orchard road 
nice hotel with fabulous staff 
room service was like an hour 
the gym or fitness centre is small but definitely adequate 
however staying here you do n't pay the city center pricing or the crowds 
not to be confused with other hotels with similar names is located near the end of orchard road in 
close to many shops restaurants and public transport 
average ambience . 
but rude front desk staff 
or you want liquor at affordable prices 
there was n't a fridge and microwave like in a normal fours points 
the dinner was excellent too and very good value for money 
and a great upgrade offer ( optional - i declined 
fairly good food etc 
but the friendly front desk staff said they could assign me a room 
no complimentary toiletries 
chocolate and biscuits complimentary water 
typical big chain hotel --- nice beds --- good service --- clean --- fantastic breakfast --- central locationvery 
it 's a short walk to the city centre and a good 20-30 minute walk to the 
shower only bathrooms 
i like the hotel location beside more london riverside 
and many nearby restaurants 
the staff are all very attentive and genuinely friendly 
away from the hustle and bustle of too many tourists but with good links to train tube and 
club lounge very well stocked and a great ambience 
i would recommend simply to plan on taking the train if you need to go to fra 
we took an uber from heathrow and it cost 37 one way and 50 on the way back 
the set up was pretty good and the items in the hot breakfast were a step above normal although a 
we found the front reception staff at the crowne plaza to be very helpful and efficient 
will definitely be visiting this hotel on my next business trip back to this part of town 
internet is still to be paid at the hilton - many close by hotels and restaurants offer that for 
the bed is also very comfortable 
hope i will have my bathrobe with slippers next time 
the exit is about a 3 block walk to the hotel if you take the tooley street exit 
fabulous cocktails 
but i prefer the understated elegance and incredible service at the emiliano 
however the restaurant is always a let down due to the poor service 
the bar on the roof is great and has a real buzz to it 
dark carpeting and very low light 
the wardrobe had a piece of carpet at the bottom which did n't look like it had n't 
very good value 
restaurant full but staff recommendeed chip shop as better than their food ( correct ) 
not what is being advertised checkin just ok a little slow need to find a room room was tiny 
had to have windows open at night so mad it a little noisy 
interior is clean and well decorated 
big bath tub and rubber duck 
this is a good business hotel 
but high ceilings were nice 
even though the window was open and air set to 18 degrees 
as i started to complain at reception the supervisor scurried away out the back 
comfortable bar area 
basic toiletries were neatly available next to the sink 
this is a big room with tall ceiling with a great view overlooking the seafront 
thankfully there are numerous eating places in the area who welcomed our custom 
1st floor have highest ceilings 
we were on the gold floor ( 7th ) and had a dedicated check-in and complimentary afternoon 
big window 
and is a very good price 
the room was lovely with a huge bathroom 
breakfast was a good spread and a fabulous view to sit back and enjoy your morning sumptuous 
the food at the hotel was nice 
rooms are of a good size for ny standards 
free internet was fast 
rooms are good size and very comfortable 
the rooms are spacious with great showers and very comfortable beds 
18th floor breakfast was great too 
nice n helping staff and good breakfast spread on 18th floor 
we paid 7500inr each way to the office ( before tax ) and got free airport transfer 
the public areas were very modern and contemporary with funky furniture 
and it was essentially a large junior suite -- a ton of space for new york 
i was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a live risotto counter . 
plus a good breakfast selection and gym facilities 
walking distance to old town about 3-5 minutes 
wifi good 
malaga has a really vibrant city centre and is well worth exploring 
and decor modern and clean 
it feels like you have your own small apartment with all that space 
i would say the food was excellent 
great service 
sometime at these high hotels 
i think they could do with an upgrade to free wifi throughout if they want to attract more buis 
in central madrid 
the hotel is lovely and very well located 
the concierge was unhelpful and not friendly to provide any assistance when tried to get a 
or there is another chain of supermarkets call sainsbury about 10 minutes walk away where you can buy 
relatively good hotel location however there is way too much smoke in the lobby for it to be a 
the bed was very comfortable and location is fantastic 
the location is excellent as others have said with the tube and buses a block away and the brunswick 
and yes the drinks do seem expensive but you get great nibbles included and the location is worth the 
we ate in the main restaurant as there was a summer deal on 
the staff are very friendly and knowledgable - the concierge was particularly helpful 
stayed here for work for three nights i found the staff polite and courteous with good english 
hotels should really be upfront about charges and not be like low cost airlines with surprises 
there are some better located hotels 
and keen to do whatever they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible 
little touches always impress like the butler closet so u do n't even have to open your front 
breakfast a bit disappointing and bed linen is linen not cotton 
great service ( especially at the front desk ) 
i have stayed at most super luxury properties in rajasthan but this one belittles all 
one of the best hotels in which i have ever stayed 
the grounds and pool are beautiful we paid 1050 for 2 nights including food 
big windows and nice sofa in front of the window to allow us enjoy the view of osaka and 
one of the butlers delivered a refreshing welcome drink and sweets which i believe changes from season to season 
tv in the gym is also only in japanese and only offers 6 channels 
suite 36 has a very good view of the village and the mountains 
nowhere near the quality one would get in a premier inn - which was disappointing 
nice warm lobby 
close to the mrt and some really great restaurants 
would definitely stay here again 
the hotel is about a 5 minute walk from wan chai mtr station so really easy to 
) we were given a dirty room 
concierge staff are also very friendly 
i have been to multiple resorts ( cuba 
plus the one under the freeway ) that leads to a lot of great dining options plus cheap shopping 
take a local longboat tour to local islands to enjoy some snorkelling and more stunning scenery 
bread is horrible ( very industrial ) - shower floods full bathroom - a c is difficult to regulate will 
the rooms are light 
the bar is nice and cosy 
was clean and elegant with top-notch bedding 
and luxurious furnishings 
no information was provided on the facilities of the hotel and a myriad of questions asked without listening to the 
we looked for a hotel online and saw availability at blue indigo so we took a cab straight to 
having explained well the spg plat amenities and hotel facilities-rooms are extremely spacious and incredibly well appointed 
rue d or ( 1f ) has good food and an excellent ( if pricey ) wine 
the rooms are hip and the view from the pool on the top floor is simply stunning 
it is right in the luxury shopping district of milan 
the hotel has a discreet entrance on via ges that opens up onto the bar and lounge 
upper floors and away from courtyard bar noise 
avoid the not so good roof top bar 
as well as tables and chairs in a covered area to eat or read 
if you are visiting the convention centre this fabulous modern hotel is just 10 min walk and close to w 
the swimming pool looks great on the photos 
room was very small - containing a single bed 
right by the old city 
but my room on the 4th floor was clean 
large bathroom that i 'd take home with me if i could ( 
the toiletries are good 
also has a nice roof top bar 
. 
fantastic position next to the station 
the bar on the pool level was very nice although smoking is allowed outside and there were a couple of 
free internet of course etc 
the rain shower was powerful and good to use 
the air conditioning and soundproofing were excellent so we slept well 
self parking is a pain as it is always busy and had to circle for 20 minutes searching for a 
washing facilities and hot tub we wished we could have stayed in this hotel for longer 
beautiful lobby lounge 
the pool was closed due to thunderstorms but looked superb 
hope the quality of this hotel continues 
the bed was very comfortable 
cool hip design and nice roof top pool 
which was quarter past ten 
close to major department stores and the metro 
request a room on a high floor 
kind of lacks design for guest privacy like they could not afford to build out this space 
we feel the indigo is an excellent value with wonderful customer service 
a shame as the bed was one of the most comfortable i 've ever attempted to sleep in 
but very clean apartment in a nice neighborhood near st 
lounge chair and small table 
there 's nothing terrible about this place - but there are way too many better options to ever return 
the bathroom too was large 
its a 5-10 min walk to the sheung wan mtr station ( exit b ) 
the location is good and the historic building is nice 
the whole area is quiet but not dead 
if you are lucky enough to get the higher floors 
so the lady came in and shoved the bed together which is all she did 
the rooms are comfortable enough with basics provided . 
we took the first cruise in the morning and there is a shuttle bus from the lodge to the boats 
a good cafe and a shop that seems to serve the camping ground 
wait for the mini bus just outside reception - runs frequently throughout the day night and drops you off very 
the staff were very friendly 
a minor downside was that the hotel 's lobby was undergoing renovation and we had to check in at 
close to the famous lan kwai fong nightlife and restaurants and easy access to the mid 
it is no excuse that this is a remote area 
another great stay at the q station 
it is value for money and the staffs 
at least my room here had a window 
our only comments were that the bed was very hard but we were able to sleep fine 
the breakfast room is very small and crowded and if you 're not into chinese type of breakfast 
we got to that airport express station in good time 
rooms have safes and bathrooms clean 
i love the open area 
room was spotless and bathroom was super clean 
you get a canned drink when you check in 
but very good value 
the gym and spa were very good 
free wifi 
the swimmingpool was of good size but cold 
our private garden dinner was also well organised 
wow ! 
this small boutique hotel is on a little pedestrian street near zion square 
ask at the front desk for a luggage rack 
while checking in i was then advised we had 2 breakfasts included and the rollaway was at 
super bathroom 
the bathroom was massive with a fantastic shower - good heat and great water pressure 
food options are plenty although nothing stands out much 
the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning very effective ( unfortunately often left on by the housekeeping 
there are plenty of restaurants right near the hotel also 
the lobby and other public facilities were beautiful 
not so great location 
you can take the free blue h1 hotels shuttle bus 
i had a lunchtime snack of trio de empanadas de ternera which are 
stairs to sun lounge area which is outsideunlike brazil you cannot get english speaking tvgym 
low end to really high end shops available 
location is everything ! 
which was fairly sized & clean 
and a pretty good value 
a great value for money in hk for families 
it has nice swimming pool 
we had good views of the city and this hotel is located in a nice area 
the work area provided a decent space in which to function and the beds were sufficiently comfortable for us to 
and i rate this the best value for money 
the hotel has seen better days 
restaurants and public transport 
but the duvet felt like it was from the original set maybe from the 90s 
my free drinks at the bar ( basic complimentary entitlement as an accor member ) 
but advance reservation is needed as the price is reasonable 
a ready umbrella awaits guests should you need one 
free internet 
the pool was nice and the kids liked it but the breakfast was disappointing with poor quality bacon and powdered 
room - it was quite a walk down the hall to get to the room and the first thing i 
the hotel is situated in the heart of the city and is a short cab ride or subway ride away 
especially outside the shower as it appeared to be a smooth dark marble floor 
a wonderful swiming pool and a gym with a good size and a lot of equipment 
it can be a very good value for the money as well 
take bus k3 and it stops right at the doorstep of holiday inn golden mile 
hong kong island is a short trip away by the star ferry 
the bed slept soft and good 
nice new rooms 
plenty of options and local food all around 
wonderfull breakfast 
but i have stayed at this property for more than 60 times because it is always offers predictably consistent 
and within walking distance of the star ferry area and the very beautiful walkway of the stars along the 
with a separate sofa 
large clean bedroom and bathroom 
o hotel and fort cornwallis was a just short walk away 
the bathroom was small but had a great shower cubicle with super powerful shower 
room was rather huge with basic furniture and tolietries 
they did have some nice touches 
room is clean and bed is comfortable with selection of pillow types 
breakfast buffet is limited compared to asian hotel norms but more than adequate 
the older concierge staff are excellent but the advice you get varies with who you happen to ask 
the hotel is in a very good area and so close to the shopping area 
one is superior suite and one standard 
the hotel is comparable big to other similar price hotel in hong kong 
they offered me a free early check in plus club lounge benefits if i would accept a lower category of 
our room was on the 7th floor and we had a bit of a city view 
lots of restaurants nearby 
negatives were no bath in the room and very slow internet ( although free on my rate ) 
ironically the late arrival and early departure were to accommodate a stay at the intercontinental hong k 
great value here 
10 minute walking distance to wangfujing and all the shops and things there ( with a metro 
it 's just a matter of whether it is a good value for what you are paying 
the lounge is located on the 23rd floor 
walkable distance to mtr and many decent restaurants and massages 
when in hong kong is this hotel the best place to stay 
among the ultra luxurious amenities and oh-so-amazing spa 
the hospitality is great 
good sized rooms and always been my favourite hotel 
hi golden mile can be easily accessed from hk airport by airport express train 
ac hard to adjust to perfect temperature and bathroom needs some sprucing up along with new towels 
but it 's very clean and a great location for sightseeing 
however taxis are readily available 
tea and soft drinks 
and overall comfortable even if the aircon is a little cold 
there is a free shuttle service to and from the hotel provided by one of the airport transport companies and 
so was looking for some sort of shuttle bus as you see around the world ) 
fantastic value - great bed 
as a young woman travelling alone i felt perfectly safe walking back to the hotel from dinner and the night 
this was a special trip for my daughter and myself - a once in a life time opportunity to spend 
overall nice property 
there were chip tiles marble and the toilet doors etc were in bad condition with door laminates broken 
large bed with perfect location 
the room was wonderful but the service was excellent 
perfect airport hotel 
close to good restaurants and close to the mtr 
which was one of the lowest rates i have paid at the ritz ( the westin was 110 
there is also a hot tub for those who prefer to indluge 
the rooms are good and clean 
the lounge and service were good 
i know it is tempting to make a cash point out of a hotel in this busy city 
rooms and old and charmless 
plenty of dinning and shopping options close by 
the hotel staff were n't very friendly but really we enjoyed our stay 
comfortable size rooms 
suggest as high floor as possible other than the top two ( where the pool can get a bit noisy 
front desk and staff was not friendly 
a very noisy aircon heater unit 
mattress and pillows are lumpy and old so as most of the decorations in the room 
the lounge is big enough to be a kids bed and the other on a rollaway in hte 
only gripe would be that is was a longer than advertised walk to the bond street station ( and 
none . 
we heard loud noise from the room next door 
i 'm sure with the price paid for a club room 
the airport is about an hour from the motel 
the reception were very helpful my husband left his phone charger at the hotel when we left and they sent 
room was reasonably good size 
the rooms are great with decent sized rooms 
all amenities and the staff is very polite and helpful 
like most of oman wifi was poor and not able to support facetime or skype 
drink wise the old bar ( of plutonium fame ) is quite pleasant and has some friendly staff 
located in a relatively quiet square in mayfair 
i stayed in a club floor room and the room was fine 
the small refrigerator was quite cold i did n't need to use the ice bucket 
the location was near perfect 
nice and modern with decent bathroom 
but the novotel kl warrants an early evaluation for the appalling service it has offered to 
the main dining area had a 15 minute wait 
room was larger than average for new york and had all of the typical hilton amenities including a 
the towels were thin 
highly recommendedi got there from klia on the subway ( 35rm ) and then walked across the 
there 's underground public parking right in front of hotel and you get a discount if staying at the 
and i loved that the windows opened - if only a fraction - to allow fresh air into the room 
the bathroom was looking a little worn and the amenties are not as good as other hotel 
there are coffee shops nearby 
though a little small and not all that well laid out - they provide a good nights sleep though which 
excellent value for money 
good solid marriot quality 
decent bathroom 
will be the hotel i chose again when i next visit kl 
the room as with the hotel overall is clean and presentable 
whilst the staff is friendly and competent 
a further short walk is a very good shopping centre on jalan sultan ismal between jalan 
small room with little furniture 
breakfast buffet is very good with friendly service 
and staff is generally friendly and helpful 
a clean and fairly new gym 
yes the bathroom was a bit basic but it was clean with decent towels 
booked this hotel for an original 3 days and then ended up for 8 days the hotel location is 
well worth the few extra dollars for the exclusivity and you can go there at any time and get 
a little confusion at time of checking out due to one of the staff not understanding english very well but 
accidentally left my personal belongings in the room after checking out but the management till today ( 8 06 
rooms are old and need refurbishment 
i recommend to get a junior suite - it is very spacious and you get access to the executive lounge 
i was able to walk or subway everywhere i needed to go 
loved the special coffee and fruit juice 
the corridors are dark and unpleasant with paint peeling off the floor and the room was not much better 
the food is good 
the buffet breakfast is limited but adequate 
the suite was very generous in size with a very large bathroom 
it is a high quality city hotel with a touch of contemporary art 
the room ( 522 ) looked over lexington avenue -- it was bright and quiet with the windows 
however if you are flying from t5 as i was the following morning it takes 45 mins as 
it was primarily western cuisine 
the free internet is from prehistoric dial up age 
we stayed at this hotel as it was conveniently located at the airport for our early morning flight 
i found the bed a little hard for my liking but the bathroom had a great shower 
bond street and oxford street are almost at the end of the road and you have the fabulous 
the concierge is a winner 
the nearby cafe del amore is a better and more affordable choice 
you can enjoy free wifi in your rooms if you are ihg reward club members 
ordered room service and the selection 
it was ok but the food was bad and the bed was not great 
great breakfast and friendly staff 
the bed was huge but the pillows are not as normal in holiday inn 
the lobby atmosphere was like you were in africa 
transportation to the parks is not great because you have to take the buss instead of the mon 
i really liked staying in the african kingdom lodge mainly because of the african feel it has 
the corby trouser press was a real bonus . 
rooms have an adequate size 
uncomfortable furniture and disappointing 
stayed here for 3 nights in one of the new select rooms 
good for in-om working , close to underground to go to the city , westminster , 
looked at other pools and think marriot one of nicest 
we payed for a standard room and got a free upgrade to an executive room ( which has a 
( we did go up to the bar and the observation decks and the view from there was really nice 
the bathroom was good and the bed comfy 
there are a number of trendy restaurants within walking distance 
great location near the riverfront but quiet as well 
the only negative point that free wifi only availble at lobby hotel only 
the hotel is in a great location and is very well maintained with quiet and stylish rooms 
the staff were fantastic - could n't be more helpful or friendly 
but just an average hotel where you want to sleep and go the next day ( which did not bother 
the bar has great drink and the bartender super nice 
we were initially checked into a room which was right next to the swimming pool ( on the first floor 
but food is decently priced and great 
the handheld shower worked well but other andaz i have stayed at had much better showers 
i called reception and the took care of me by changing my room right away 
the rooms are clean and spacious - make sure you get a corner room or suite if you can 
the front desk staff were very helpful indeed and i had a large and comfortable room 
very good the guys on reception were in a charitable mood immediately offered us an upgrade as they weren t 
a very good airport hotel with a personal toiuch 
while in san jose i cannot think of a better hotel than the el presidente 
the beds were amazing which offered a terrific night 's rest 
the hotel room was of decent size and had nice contemporary decorations 
i was also downgraded from a king bed full harbour view room to a partial harbour view room because 
dayne at the spg desk looked at my status and upgraded me to a suite with a spectacular 
very friendly reception desk but when they check you in to a room below the grade you paid for you 
the queen queen room was fine with very comfortable beds although the bathroom lacks a bath and in its place 
the receptionist ( ms laveera ) found out about my friend 's birthday and she arranged 
close to madison sq garden . 
with floor to ceiling windows gave us great views over manhattan 
7 ) internet is not included in the rather expensive room rate 
my agent wrongly booked me for a day less than i required and the hotel was nice enough to extend 
cool lobby with a nice bar coffee shop and a portugese restaurant i did n't go to 
very nice hotel for people with style 
to start we were concerned as it was out of the city centre but the tram stops right outside the 
but the best thing was the mattress and the pillows 
the breakfast was a good one 
self parking lot is a pain to get to 
with up to 4 full-sized luggage open at the same time in different areas of the room and 
wi-fi is also not included in the standard room rates which is ridiculous in 2015 
the place is carefully decorated and designed and the curator clearly pays a lot of attention to the details 
small kitchenette and a well equipped bathroom 
we stayed here for 6 nights pre-tour with evergreen and to catch up with relatives in 
business suite is roomy and allows access to the club lounge 
the bed very comfortable and the shower bath very good 
we are talking about hong kong a bustling city 
the rooms are pretty basic 
easy walking distance to downtown 
however the bed is extremely firm and the carpet is very squashy which means it was either poorly 
and it was not possible to get consistent water temperature in the shower 
look on the net for cheaper value for money deals 
after climbing the first flight of stairs 
love the lobby vibe and the hidden burger joint just past the curtains was a great gimmick 
the lobby is beautiful and staff really try to be friendly and helpful 
) it does have free parking 
the restaurant was busy but the ma tre d' found us a nice table in a quiet area of 
we told the front desk and they said they would send someone up while we where out 
it is normally priced around 60 which makes it great for a shopping weekend stop as well as a good 
and the fact that the hotel can take you from 56th to 57th internally was great 
fantastic view of central park 
free shuttle bus services to down town places of interests and offices 
rollaways for the kids were fine . 
nyc hotels are expensive anyway and this is a luxury hotel just off central park south 
the coffee was great and the waitress delightful 
old junior suite very old with a huge hole in the wall under tv but room was big enough for 
so i told them i had no need for the gym or pool and the wifi i get for free 
this is the fourth time i stay here primarily because of its excellent location 
the room is spacious 
they provide a free shuttle service but not during the night 
my only complaint was that the windows in my room were very dirty which made the view tough to see 
00 is expensive for a coffee and two slices of toast 
this hotel is for guests who are looking for that 1980s-1990s high end elegant hotel 
close to good restaurants and shopping 
breakfast was really good and there 's a starbucks right in front of the hotel ( well 
the bed was really comfortable and the pillows were really fluffy 
high floors above 10 facing the sea to get a good sea view 
i really wanted to leave a good review as the staff throughout were fantastic 
but check your room 
i stayed one night here as it was the best deal during one of these frequent busy times in sing 
as we were on the top floor 
it is excellent value and great food 
look the groud transport counter who handels the hourly shuttle 
this hotel is located in a central place with easy access to buses 
lobby and the rooms first impression but the beds are comfy with brand new sheets and the towels 
the hotel is minutes away from buckingham palace and westminster and is in a beautiful building 
the lift is slow as well and during the peak hours eg morning or dinner time - be prepared to 
i always seem to be travelling to penang with extended family members and the gurney resort has 
so i decided to give gurney hotel another chance but ended up with greater disappointment 
have been to penang many times staying in different hotels and for sure will come again and probably stay 
as usual with hotels 
front desk and cleaning staff were friendly and efficient 
i was n't crazy about the way the bathroom is a bit open to the room 
this hotel has a nice long lobby and some good staff at checkin 
but pretty expensive for its facilities 
hence one of its strong points is the proximity to the airportthe hotel also offers a free airport 
10 minute walk to the beach with great running and walking tracks 
none of the amenities that i 've become accustomed to in hotels such as a fruit bowl and daily 
higher the better to avoid street noise 
basic but pleasant design room - big enough for an additional roll away and a small lounge chair 
breakfast in the bistro was nice however recommend that you order a la carte rather than 
the beautiful st james courtyard where you can have a drink or a snack and the quality of food 
decorated and very spacious 
there is a free shuttle bus to and from the airport around the clock 
directly opposite the hotel is an excellent huge shopping centre if you want a bit of retail therapy 
the mall next to the hotel had closed by the evening but there is a walkway over the road 
the reception staff were totally uninterested in helping us out so we had to make several trips up to 
the second one is a very nice sauna 
the property is a little quirky 
restricted window opening 
i used the spa club - great 
lovely crisp soft bedding blah blah 
a good sized writing desk 
great location and wonderful service 
stayed one night . 
we made use of the spa and while the facilities were excellent and the staff were trying their best 
the complete building was levelled to ground and certainly there will be something starting next door which can be 
good location right next to train station 
but the first room we checked into had an interconnecting door that had no sound proofing whatsoever 
i paid cash for the bus back to the airport not realising that a limo had been booked 
the lounge is located on the ground level with a starbucks next door that opens at 4 
in the midst of this traffic stuck city is the peaceful oasis shangri la 
this is definitely a great choice for an airport hotel 
and convenient airport shuttle the next day 
a little out of the way in hk terms being up in mong kok but this is 
this is a great hotel and my new favorite in bengalaru 
good ambience 
the shangri-la bangalore is a new glitzy property and having stiff competition from 
a large mall 
execellent hotel in great location 
the breakfast buffet is excellent 
rooms are small and not very functional - a cheap renovation left old wood furniture that does n't match 
terrific property and even better with renovation 
separate toilet although not private is somebody else is in bathroom due to glass door 
there was protesting by thousands of people in the main square not far from the hotel 
you have a nice walking path along the bay with good views 
the impressive service starts from the first minute with a no-fuss check in and then maps 
free shuttle bus service ( book your seats in advance at the hotel conceirge ) one of the 
rooms are modern with the conveniences you expect 
what we got was more akin to a days inn with a fancy lobby 
and if you want to order from the main restaurant menu you can ( at cost of course ) 
as is the well equipped gym 
it was pricey but worth it 
walking distance to several restaurants 
the menu is very limited as were the opening hours of some areas of the hotel where you could eat 
what was extra special were the blackout blinds and the double glazed windows 
the price was good 
yes the rooms are kinda oldyes you can hear the coming and going of the planes but facilities wise 
we should have stayed for 3 nights but ended up staying for 10 due to the flight disruption in euro 
which also had an excellent selection of good quality food - expensive ( and wasted on the kids really ) 
much more pleasant then city view 
the first night was great - nice table near a crackling fire 
the room was fine with no external noise evident 
definitely a nice touch 
the hotel is located in kowloon in mongkok which is famous with the street markets but 
i was not very happy as i had booked this hotel in june & i was less happy when 
needs an upgrade- the shower is a bit out of date and they could be replaced by newer units 
stayed at several hotels in hk before and this one beats all the other ones comparing their prices 
the only let down was the inconsistent wifi internet in the room and throughout the hotel 
i would recommend this place to people that are looking at staying a longer period and in need of an 
the food was very well prepared and has a good vegetarian section especially catering to the indians 
however the hotel is based in the grand century place shopping mall & is accessible by the mtr 
higher floor with all club benefits which was very nice 
good hotel in a nice location 
stayed on club floor with everything you could want 
bed and pillows are just nice for us 
it is a perfect hotel if you are not paying full price 
get rooms at the front and from the 4th floor up for views 
i need to say for me was nice for the experience but not even close to real chic and trendy 
one point to note is this is a family resort so it does not have quite the tranquility of 
we tried the restaurant for dinner on two occasions - and the service staff and bartender are very friendly 
the breakfast was okay 
large pillows 
the only objection i see is that you have to wait too long during check in and check out 
the welcome handwritten note from the general manager 
nice bedroom 
flower market and also the main shopping area in mong kok 
it 's right by a metro station ( n m st republiky ) and a ton 
very appealing hotel 
the location is great with access to the adjoining shopping plaza and the east mongkok kcr train 
3m pool filled with floating legos for the kiddos and another good sized 1 
a fantastic setting of legos in this hotel 
probably the best in the area 
the family room size is good 
this hotel is located in a beautiful setting but that is all 
my only complain is the free wifi is very slow 
there 's also an activity area further back to keep them occupied with colouring and games supervised by 
long queue at checkintook three goes to finally get hotel to accept that our room door would not 
the hotel also have some restaurants nearby so food should n't be an issue 
20 staff already clearing out most foods although they saw many guests are still comingbreakfast staff are not 
book a double room 
good hospitality 
is nicely decorated with many ornaments 
central park is a short taxi ride away 
the on site restaurants were good 
the room was good 
it still has the elegant old charm and the staff were great 
one of the downsides is the long waits at reception at check in and check out 
the swimming pool was small 
on the lowest floor looking directly at the car park and air con unit 
we had a very friendly check in staff who welcomed us well 
the lobby itself is a great place to keep kids entertained already 
this time we didnt have so much window space and the view was n't as great 
which was a nice touch 
the pool was the perfect place to be to cool off 
concierge floor was certainly worth the surcharge 
on the 12th floor and was clean though dated 
the bed is firm and the pillows are big and plush - had a great sleep there 
lounge and small dining table 
i complained about the cost of breakfast and they gave them vouchers for 10 off the price each morning 
but re-stocking was slow and the coffee was horrible 
fantastic pool and nice food 
there is a food hall next to the hotel 
the outdoor balcony was small with two outdoor chairs and a small table 
also enjoyed the high tea 
but the kind of service u get is worth 
very nice facility 
there is a lott better value and quality hotels there than this 
i got a room facing the swimming pool and the sea 
dinner at their new restaurant run by peter kuravita outstanding ( star card holders must 
the spread of food was amazing and the authentic indian breakfast dishes were very very nice 
it was n't bad with a pretty good selection especially the freshly cooked options 
i was sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with shared bathroom and living area which was comfortable and very spacious 
restaurants like masala bay serves authentic indian cuisine & was superb 
the lobby is very noisy due to the bar right next to it 
my room is always upgraded and the breakfast is one of the bestspecial thanks to executive chef nag 
with nice furniture and housekeeping does a nice job ( compared to some other nyc hotels ) 
the rooms were excellent - huge and a magnificent bathroom 
gawp at the ferraris outside and keep walking a few hundred yards 
however be warned that the restaurants are expensive - even by mumbai standards 
a special call out to brendan ( night manager ) on my check out who ensured i got 
high quality 
the staff is very friendly and competent 
take this advise from a very loyal customer 
the service is very much 'text-book-style' and quite robotic in nature 
its one of the best hotels in mumbai 
the car park is rather smelly due the fumes and the amount of dripping water 
there was some construction work at the beach side 
the only downside was storage space if you were travelling as a couple - very limited hanging space and only 
the fully stocked bathroom ( tooth paste 
no decent coffee in the hotel but great coffee shop and a coles across the road 
the limited time we spent in the lounge was great and the service exceptional 
taxi fare from the airport is approx 50 
cold cuts and cereals 
from first arriving at the hotel with the absolute traffic jam and total chaos in the front driveway area it 
you can get better value 
i loved the pool and the service at the pool 
it was around a 7-10 minute walk from the king 's cross tube station if you are 
b'fast was excellent with cold cereal 
very good quality food are served 
brand new renovation 
the wifi is great and the food and restaurant bar were excellent 
the bathroom had double basin facilities with a wet area and swimming pool sized bath which i did not use 
but travellers if you book direct to hotel and get my same experience 
reasonable price 
no pronblem whatsoever for a relatively reasonable price 
clean rooms 
a high end shopping mall 
the rooms where very spacious the staff where all very friendly and it is in a great location to all 
and modern bathroom 
you must also be aware that staying right in the midst of times square has its downsides 
good hotel restaurant 
the decor is modern and clean 
this new park hyatt in bangkok is just next to a shopping center with all the findet 
separate toilet 
separate toilet 
unmatched views of the times square skyline and a great place to unwind at the end of the 
newly refurbished 
very good value 
always really nice and they have a good breakfast and free internet 
as a member leading hotels group one expects good service and the hotel is to some extent no exception 
i would n't give it an excellent rating 
simple but elegant with luxury materials 
service by various staff are of high standards and generally friendly and helpful 
bathrooms on the lower levels tend to have better water pressure 
someone at the hotel needs to address the fact that making a loyal customer happy with an upgrade is much 
on the downside the car park get quite full and then you need to leave your car keys with the 
room was comfortable and front desk friendly and helpful 
the executive lounge was small and could be busy in the evening 
the bar downstairs had friendly staff and the morning breakfast buffet was niceis close to restruant so 
staff were friendly and checkout was easy 
ideal for regular business traveller whose company only funds 3 star accomm and only 5min walk to 
let alone european de lux hotels 
the roof top lounge and terrace is very nice and a lovely place to have a drink at the 
but not a subway friendly hotel 
great room service 
this was our first trip to spain 
room was spacious and clean 
separate shower and dual sinks 
i stayed here for two nights and rate this hotel average due to the small rooms 
again everything clean but the furniture 
only the window had a wooden blind and consequently was useless 
right next to a metro station 
the outside bar and swimming pool area is great 
with nice smellies 
first the front desk is extremely arrogant and unfriendly negatif-they provide only two mini 
it 's very spread out 
this hotel has beautiful grounds 
a gem of a hotel in central london 
lovely hotel 
the business center is also shared with the holiday inn and i used it for printing out documents 
high ceilings and large windows help give the rooms a spacious feel 
clean and spacious 
try and stay on a higher floor as the higher you go the less the traffic noise 
we never had dinner three times same place thanks to leroy who served us at grand cafe 
we stayed in one of the hotels' executive suites which has a huge bathroom -- separate shower 
spotlessley clean and internet is free 
the bed was firm enough 
- not enough lifts 
very gracious and helpful employees 
as well as a large wet bar 
the linens were of a very good quality and the bed was comfortable 
have been there several times and always get a different layout but all of them extremely comfortable 
room is of great size 
the audio videos system and most important for me the bed comfort and the noise proof so your night is 
the service was what you would expect from a trump property . 
if you want to use the gym you need to pass through the swimming pool ( small ) and then 
eventually we sent them away so they could have some privacy and i called the manager ( although the 
if you are a tourist you dont get the old city atmosphere but these old town hotels looked a mix 
the rooms are quiet 
with awesome views and great amenities 
indeed still one of the best value for money hotel in manila as compared to those in m 
spend a quick 2 days at this hotel and found it to be friendly staff 
brand new spectacular hotel in the central district 
next to a park 
usb charging outlets and the like 
not acceptable when you type 2 2 people during the reservation 
this is a good choice if you want to stay in this part of manila and the staff are 
worked out in the gym which is very spacious and nice 
the concierge lounge is excellent 
club lounge is good 
the usual marriott bed awaits and comfortable hotel bathroom and amenities recommend for business travelles 
we stayed here for 7 nights and the service was impeccable throughout our stay 
the comfiest bed in soho 
there was a dirty room service tray on the floor by the room across the hall from mine 
just not very effective resulting in long waiting times or a lack of service delivery 
they also have the weekend late-night buffet ( friday and saturday ) from 10 
i ordered room service one night here and it was quickly delivered 
mini bar and microwave 
bar and restaurant areas very open plan and with the use of wood and stone very eco friendly 
the side table was not cleaned so the tea cup stain and splash remained on the table top detracting 
extremely worth the price paid 
the pool area is always kept clean and the staff are always hovering around to make the stay memorable 
who helped me lots with the booking and the room 
and if you really need a rest the free shuttle minibus from to the fs is departing every hour 
the service was good 
amazing breakfast buffet at the hotel with great quality food and service 
pay extra and go for the higher floors 
even the rooms less than full suites are very nice 
then there was a shower and a toilet in separate cupboards 
they seems to shut down elevators over night as we needed to wait for a bit when coming home 
so i was left with my room not done and i had to ask new towels 
even better perhaps out of season when the city was pleasantly quiet 
the prices were higher than we had been paying on our for similar quality 
disappearing breakfast - if you got up to get another cup of coffee 
no request is too small or large your staff will be wonderful 
ours was very spacious with a balcony 
there is nothing else to say but this is one of the most perfect hotels i have travelled to 
the pool was open and staffed 
the downside was the pool is small and looked like a chemical bath with foam over the top 
internet costs 15 a day ( not wifi but ethernet plug in your room ) but there are kios 
however those who want to see the bustling city of firenze then retreat in an enchanting 
some excellent restaurants ( like cibreo ) are within a 10 minute walk and anything further is 
it does however let itself down on food quality consistency and the location is not ideal 
the room was fantastic and the pools were amazing - i loved the rum shack and the daily activities 
the worst aspect was the distance from town which added approx 300 aud to the costs due to the taxi 
thought they pour the drinks a little bit short 
the bed was firm and comfortable 
the bed was very comfortable as usual for a westin 
clean with all amenities 
but know that the location above a station at the crossroad of the two the main metro lines in 
a gym is available with relevant space 
modern amenities 
airier and decent decor 
service and breakfast just ok 
because it would be half the distance if you could ) from east india dlr station with good 
its perfect as a business hotel 
mayfair is such a lovely area 
most of rooms are small and dated 
i would recommend this hotel for tourists as well as for business 
it may not have the most luxurious room or setting 
but a nice hotel nonetheless 
the beds for me were very hard and so after the first night we had to change rooms as i 
the bar and restaurant area was nice but not that many people around 
all public areas - lobby 
arriving there a noted that the public areas are small and shabby and the overall ambiance 
with a strong smell of paint that made us dizzy and with a beautiful view at a wall 2 
the alda hotel is located in central reykjavik on a small quiet street but also 
deservedly proud of their unique city and country 
have various cheeses and conducts 
i thought the furnishings were quite good 
is definately very good value for money especially in sydney 
with helpful front desk staff and i would be happy to stay there again 
tastefully decorated and quite cosy 
i can provide booking numbers of my hotel stay if you do not believe me 
basic 24 hour room service where you go and pick up - fine considering price 
valet parking is expensive 
i had room 511 great view of sunrise and it was wonderful to sit out on the veranda 
the bar area and restaurant are very nice and the breakfast was excellent 
like the jd wetherspoons ( the gate clock ) next to the cutty sark 
still finding its way as a hilton it was a good stay not too many highlights however the staff 
the constituent parts of the full english were all top notch 
extra points for a very nice bathroom sliding door with a lot of text about greenwich history 
we stayed in a bow suite with an excellent view and a big balcony 
i arrived late flight at 01 
i also think that they should have higher quality bathroom amenities in their suites 
they charge on hourly packages and the rates are not cheap 
downsides are the absolute ridiculous amount of security checks you have to go thru to get there 
i recently stayed at the hilton for 2 nights and overall it is a good choice business hotel in 
it has an adequete work out room and a nice rooftop pool and spa 
one of the best airport transit hotels i have stayed at 
not nearly as friendly as check-in 
two different ships parked there on two different days 
the lobby is tiny and the breakfast for 14 dollars is served in awful plastic dinnerware 
pay the extra to upgrade to the deluxe plus to get a corner room with spectacular views 
the hilton in auckland sits right down on the harbour and looks like an old fashion ocean liner 
this is a hotel that is well located next to the wharf 
the walk in shower smelled especially bad 
reception is bright with harbour views and the adjacent bar area is very peasant both day time with great 
truly outstanding hilton hotel in a wonderful location 
quiet surrounding and free spa on the 8th floor 
10 for a black cab from airport 
i think there 's better options in the west london area and i will probably explore those on 
right outside your balcony window 
the wi-fi is a problem in some of the areas but other then that its a good value 
such a nice hotel 
lots of equipment and free weights 
our two single beds were more like doubles and we had a bath and separate shower which is unusual in 
attended an event at the o2 and chose this hotel for location 
bathroom was clean and great water pressure 
there are a lot of restaurants available to you 
my only complaint is that this being a marriot and an airport hotel 
with separate bath and shower 
what the hotel has done is put a single computer and printer into what is essentially a windowless closet 
great hotel this is a lovely new hotel . 
i stayed for 3 nights in late april and during that time the weather in london was awful 
the pool is amazing too 
housekeeping even have better customer service than them 
the hotel is quite posh - a historic building with many interesting features - centrally located close to shopping 
hotel is undergoing some development work adding new floors at top of building and it looks ugly 
the hotel is centrally located downtown and just a walking distance from the cbd and offices building 
the bellhop came to pick up the left luggage saying that it was a mistake because the room was 
the room was nice and everything we needed was there 
and there was a pretty good lobby bar 
no seperate shower in the bathroom 
the bed was large and cozy ( great nights sleep ) 
social spaces were fantastic and the breakfast very good 
the only negative i found the duvet quite thick so was hot during the night 
way overpriced i spent 1 night at the hotel and ended up staying in a old room on the 
the room is totally satisfactory--comfortable bed and clean 
the service is brilliant 
the hotel however was very convenient to shopping areas and the train station 
very quiet despite the hotel 's excellent location near one of the main downtown shopping areas 
has all the usual facilities you expect from the westin brand 
i brought this to the attention of the front desk 
nice art design pieces all around the public areas 
the royalton does n't have a traditional lobby 
you will have to find a nearby garage and walk to the hotel from there 
hoped to make this property my new home in chicago 
it 's okay for a short stay but if you 're not a fan of small spaces 
the staff are friendly however i would admit that the breakfast buffet is really not up to much and is 
location is actually quite good 
every day there is free bottles of water and even an afternoon snack on the first day 
the rooms are clean 
this hotel feels and behave like your average hotel in most of the small town in china 
fantastic westin shower and bulgari shampoo 
the location is perfect - within easy walking distance of many attractions and shops 
the room size is huge for european standard 
i was greeted with a friendly welcome by the front desk upon check in 
the swiss tel is a great property at a fantastic location in downtown chicago 
also a small coffee shop is next door 
nice room with nice bed and amenities 
it 's very good value 
convenient location , convenient rate central location , quiet room ( but those on the second floor facing the 
just location well located near hkcc and night clubs and plenty of restaurants around . 
where you can get a lot of nice restaurants and bars 
cipriani obviously has an awesome publicity machine selling this average property 
it 's far too small for a conference hotel and simply could n't cope with the volume 
direct booking at hotel gets extras 
and pillows- standard bathroom with good toiletries- big working desk with comfortable ergonomics chair 
the rooms are ok and clean although the bed a little hard but for the price and location this is 
i had excelent time in the property and the f&b was great 
i had to go to the front desk 
there is space to open two suitcases 
you can get free wifi at burger king 
good showers 
you can tell you 're in an old classic hotel as many of the older features are present ( 
for me the experience to sleep on the floor and the very lowdoors and room separations got quite 
breakfast was good selection of hot & cold dishes 
we also used the family onsen bath which was fun ( and free with the room ) 
it is all about comfort and great service 
it 's included in the price and is as good as you get in japan 
but very slow and poor service 
the bath is perfect in japanese style all made with cedar wood 
rooms ok and amenities are ok . 
what a blunder - so that 's why the price was incredible 
the hotels close proximity to various attractions and ease of access to the 3 main train stations made this an 
the hotel is located a block back from broad street ( the party street of b'ham ) close 
close to intercity tram . 
cheap toiletries 
a cool bar 
the rooms are decorated nicely with what feels like 60s furniture 
i actually had some very nice pasta with a pesto sauce along with some draft craft ale 
the concierge was very helpful and suggested some good places to eat near the hotel 
the lobby is non-existent and public spaces are minimal but it was the perfect place to sleep while 
with a secure car park next to hotel 
but as it was nye i did not stay for too long in the room 
all in light beech effect with glass tops 
there 's a bar and restaurant and the breakfast buffet is ok 
staff is accommodating and responsive and the facilities are in great condition 
large suitcase area ( space for 2 large suitcases ) 
given the internet deal i really think it was good value for money 
very clean with a good sized bathroom 
the staff at reception were so helpful that they let us check in that early and did not charge us 
both the room and the bathroom were large in size and clean 
it is not a convention type hotel with a lobby full of guests milling around 
the food is good and the facilities are excellent but 
2 bathrooms and a nice private garden with a small pool 
a lot of restuarents and club 's both club 's and rooms are weel 
you have to walk up steps to fourth floor and then you can take an elevator 
the infinity pool fronts the lobby at the 3rd floor 
this is a very nice hotel with very friendly people 
the kailash restaurant has a varied menu 
but worth visiting in nepal 
i contacted the front desk at 2am regarding the loud music and was told that the higher floor rooms 
and there are many great restaurants 
the service was good 
a short walk from the hotel puts you into the grand place with tons of cafes 
50 restaurants and a huge casino set by the river in a spectacular city centre location for tourists 
okay hotel at a reasonable price 
the room itself was a good size and the furniture was comfortable 
breakfast is in the cafe next door and so good to get fresh 
got the room a bit early 
free mini bar with a goody bag of snacks also free 
well managed with friendly helpful staff with a positive outlook about the brand the hotel the experience from the bell 
i could n't get the room heated during day 
but please clean the bathroom grouting 
it is the smallest i have ever seen despite having an ample sized bathroom 
and the tiny business lounge 
it was a good hotel but perhaps a little expensive for the quality ( 130 usd i think ) 
the lobby is really small when you enter and the hotel lobby is a floor 
the restaurants of lan kwai fong ( lkf ) are only a 5 minute walk 
exhausted at the end of the day we ate upstairs in the restuarant - 
the hotel offers good quality for the price 
good hotel near the times square area 
on the first floor 
the room is huge and has a big comfortable bed with nice pillows 
on a recent trip to melbourne i tried this hotel and whilst it was adequate vs other hotels i 
the hotel has no bar but you can have cocktails in the lobby lounge while listening to a good band 
overhead shower and large bathroom 
this is the best priced of the 3 crown hotels 
location is excellent minutes walk to time square and central park 
there is great shopping nearby 
its location was very near a big town square where there were lots of people dancing 
table-top-bbq is clearly an emphasis and portions were appropriately sized 
the only inconvenient is the stupid idea of merging the bathroom and the entrance 
staff is helpful 
another thing we love about the hotel is the location and also the very nice pool area ( infinity pool 
the only slight complain that the heated pool was still cold 
seemingly worn and with weaker water pressure ( similar to many nyc hotels ) 
the day bed couch near the window is nice 
i found the nearby shopping mall fun to browse as well as lower price food court options 
no space to put your luggage 
it was great to look out of the big window from high up 
with all the standard amenities and nespresso machine was in working order together with comfortable pillows 
i swim everyday and this hotel had a nice olympic sized lap pool which was one of the 
a short walk to central park 
wow wow wow this place may not be the shangrilla or pan pacific nor stan 
but the small room size did allow it to cool down to 67 f in no time 
rooms are a little dark but the beds were really comfy and large 
and the receptionist was not very accommodating when i requested for queen size bed instead of twins bed 
the bar area was n't great - either in size or cleanliness - which was very surprising for 
the staff were excellent and the breakfast was much much nicer than i was expecting 
is a bit uncomfortable to walk down to the toilet specially at night 
central park 
has a pool which i personally never used 
the wide reception area is always full of people hanging around waiting for flights 
it was a corner suite with a nice view of the area 
the view from our room was lovely as well 
bed is very comfortable and bathroom is very modern and beautifully presented the only issue i had is i was 
i had the nerve to move up the street a little and hail my own 
delicious and fairly priced for a hawaiian resort hotel 
you ca n't question the location with a few minutes walk to times square or central park with an 
beach is beautiful with ample chairs 
they did change the elevator system and i was surprised that upon checkin , nobody mentioned how to 
good shower pressure and consistent heat ( which you rarely find in thailand ) and the bed was comfortable 
room was quite spacious and had all the possible amenities 
facilities modern 
we did try the spa and it was vey good value 
room was reasonable size 
the room was nice and spacious 
the hotel is good but not perfect 
- rooms been renovated- wifi in the rooms for free- location of the hotel- best in town 
our room on the 4th floor overlooking the square was comfortable and well appointed 
rooms are comfortable with the necessary amenities 
a 5 minute walk and you arrive at new mall 
warwick has a couple of nice restaurants on the property 
i stayed here for two nights recently after a stay -- and probably a review -- last year 
the direct nile view room we had was large and very comfortable with a large balcony and fantastic views 
nice room 
with all the positive reviews 
way better in the area 
but a nice foyer 
a lovely pool area overlooking the nile so you could watch the boats sail past of an evening 
it had a great view of the nile and the pool though . 
breakfast buffet in the 'nubia' restaurant was good too - good quality ( it seemed 
great hotel in great location 
the pool at the 9th floor is a bit small and there are only a few sunbeds 
the taj savoy is without doubt the best property in ooty to stay atits a 
has a lovely fire place and has a modern yet rustic feel to it 
this will solve the issue of having too few choices of food items in the limited space 
i do like a soft bed so the bed was rather hard for me but this is more personal preference 
most of the staff are rude and arrogant coupled with the fact that the place is dirty 
an average property - good for families 
the property looks lovely on arrival and the large pool is fantastic 
i would suggest getting a cab back on an evening as some of the areas you navigate are not the 
we got a great 2 bed apartment for a one week stay here 
there was also a decent size work desk and an office-type chair 
but are comfortable with good facilities & the rooms overlooking the river have a great view 
00 as well as for extra charge for toiletries in the room 
the only minor criticisms are the lack of sun loungers at the lagoon pool and the lack 
the great facility was the free wifi 
a can of coke cost at worse wholesale 40 pence so it is annoying when hotels charge up 
ask for a river view on a high floor 
so take a tip - get in early for lounges and if you are without children take your 
easy parking 
this hotel is located in a area which is surrounded by decent restaurant and bar 
i was sceptical as we had to order our meals weeks in advance which is frequently a sign of 
the spa is also very nice and they have a new and decent gym as well 
we loved this funky hotel 
my husband and i have been firm followers of the knightsbridge for the past seven years and thought 
the staff are very helpful and friendly and the bar is great for a lovely cocktail or glass of champagne 
a decent gym and something for the kiddos 
i stayed at the grand hyatt jakarta for two nights on business last week 
the bath rooms a heaven and the interior design is perfectly balanced between classic and new 
there were numerous loungers available with sun umbrellas and the loungers were very comfortable 
safe with some very good restaurants and bars ( no need to eat in the hotel ) staff friendly 
the extra size 
the interior design is hipp and cool and the location can not be topped 
cool and fantastic value 
high floor 
there are several restaurants around which offer great food of all varieties 
room service was fast and friendly 
staff were amazing at every interaction and many recognised me from their sister hotel down the road . 
room stank of cigarettes shower actually did not work only a dribble down the side of the wall 
we booked using the hyatt gold members site at a price which was far higher than any other hotel 
decor is a tad of a tired side 
on every occasion we went to use the pools we had to wait 20 minutes for towels to be available 
the buffet breakfast is worth the pricewhat stands out for me is the efficient service in every area 
there was poor coordination between the hyatt staff and the silver bird staff which resulted in me and my 
so u need to walk at least 10 minutes then can find those shops or you can eat in hotel 
i highly recommend to my friends at least several days of relaxation here 
upon check-in i requested for a room in the top floors and the receptionist was kind enough 
i would certainly stay here when i come for an exhibition next time 
the bed was not too comfortable and the bathroom was really tiny 
what is very good is that the airport express train transfer has free shuttle bus to the exhibit and convention 
the club lounge had nice happy hour with rotating selection of food in the evening including some alcoholic beverages 
very good restaurants and impressive room service offering 
room was spacious and well laid out and shopping of all sorts plus great restaurants are all within minutes via 
in room dining was good with food arriving within 25 minutes and tasty 
very friendly staff 
pool area is very large and is the focal point of the hotel with a nice bar and the main 
we stayed in the concierge tower and had a pleasant stay 
grill is nice but small menu 
not only any old walls mind you 
and the regency club has a small infinity pool for those who are too lazy to go downhill to 
the spa was nice 
dated , faded second time in a month at a shangri-la and second deception . 
there are so many options within the hotel to meet and to eat that life will never be boring here 
in my room the carpet looked like it s been around since mao s days and it felt a 
but summer palace is also good and the cafe on the ground floor does a pretty good buffet 
old carpets and furniture 
the hotel is located on a cliff facing the ocean 
i cannot say it was too high in quality 
first of all it has to be said that the lobby is very beautiful 
it 's not good value for money 
the reception is quite nice and spacious 
even internet is free 
the hotel is very close to high street kensington and the tube so good central location 
one block from arbat st with all its eating and shopping choices 
the hotel is attached to a luxury mall with good options for casual to fine dining 
laxmi mittal stays very close to this hotel 
the hotel lobby is beautifully decorated in a traditional chinese style which gave a very grand first impression 
wonderful location 
the room itself was a decent size and other than the quirky washroom sink having separate &quot 
it smelled stale and slightly smoky as if it had been closed up for a while 
the rooms ( including bath ) and furniture are very small and worn down 
we had not seen the note and called the front desk to be told that there was a plumbing emergency 
same old china world with great service 
this was a nice touch but after a few times 
it 's attached to a mall filled with cheap to expensive eats 
the bathroom was spacious and excellent 
they also have free wireless 
i expected to be disappointed when i moved here after two wonderful days and nights at the aman at 
very good location 
this place had amazing decor 
average this hotel works well for short stays but i would not recommend staying for more than a couple of 
some good eateries around here 
the rooms are of good size for the city 
location is fabulous 
overall a very good family stay 
location was convenient and walking distance to everywhere we needed to go 
comfy bed and big bathtub 
and a huge bathroom with rainshower 
we did n't eat there in the evening as as we did n't think the restaurant itself was 
there probably better options in cape town 
the lobby terrace is beautiful especially in summer time where people can set-up meetings and sit by 
we spent a full day at the pool which was very relaxing 
if i was to make a suggestion is that a little extra lighting in rooms would be good and some 
with a powerful shower 
free wifi was pretty good speed 
the swimming pool looked lovely although i never saw anyone in it 
the price ( cheap ) and location suited my immediate needs and the write up on here was generally ok 
glossy and like any other large city hotel 
the room sizes are awfull , nicely fitted though , the bathrooms are tiny . 
with so much great food options available all over bangkok 
we had a tiny balcony as wide as the chairs and table on it 
overall - the hotel was very nice but very expensive for what it was and not great value for 
as the light in the bathroom was tipped with a red pull 
breakfast buffet was particularly good with a wide variety of nice food 
the two restaurants provide simple 
view and great value for money 
the above excluded a nice stay 
the fireplace for the cold nights makes the lobby a cosy space where to indulge after a walk on 
we had paid for a full ocean view room and were lucky enough to get one on the top ( 
bar cafe in the living room area is like the rest of this property and the city it is in 
the best feature of this hotel is the rooftop pool and the views both day and night over the sy 
and the bathroom was very big with a separate shower and bath 
full kitchen also a plus if you were planning to cook instead of eating out 
location is unbeatable - right next to fulham broadway tube station and in one of the hipp 
location just a few blocks either way to times square and central park we found this to be a great 
also a very large bathroom with toiletries 
on returning to reception and politely explaining the problem was upgraded to a large room in the east wing which 
the hotel rooms are very comfortable with great views 
surrounding area is quite nice 
i am used to 'nicer' hotels and the wellington does not meet any standard 
my single room was very small indeed -- fractionally wider than the length of my bed - and no 
our room on the 6th floor was commendably quiet 
they were able to turn the radiator down after i asked at the desk but it was still very hot 
all major attractions within minutes of walk 
it has staff that do not care for your privacy or rights 
we had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and we loved both ! 
would prefer 2 real beds in a twin 
the park across the street is a plus 
the highlight of the hotel is the small rooftop pool with amazing views over the opera house and city 
close to the old town and the museums and history of maxvorstadt 
all hotels are fairly expensive for what they offer but premier inn seems to offer good value for money 
its a small but clean space with well maintained equipment and if you are on a lengthy trip very handy 
bed very comfortable 
hotel is a short walk from old town 
good size room and king bed 
it is an easy walk into the cbd and very close to circular quay and the ferries 
i only stayed for one night and had nothing to complain about 
great food and coffee but very busy as most great cafes are 
when we were leaving for the train station to our next destination 
bedsheets are very comfortable 
unpretentious hotel in a fantastic location 
the room was very primitive and small 
however the hotel really did not have a soul and will not stay in the memory for long plus 
large lounge and kitchen 
excellent free internet with password for each room 
room was clean with good bed and pillows highlight beside the hotel is the location which makes it even 
staff were very friendly and charming 
this is a high security serviced apartment atop a commercial office centre 
the second reason i would n't come back here is that the street traffic outside the hotel is god 
big and nice apartments with kitchen facility 
badly decorated and noisy 
it is in a quiet street but within a 1 min walk your can reach the city market 
a single bed that is maybe less than a meter in wide 
no refund was offered but after a lot of arguing it was decided that i would be upgraded the next 
nice sized room 
fantastic for families looking for modern luxury close to hobart 
there are different venues for food & drink with a winery close by that you can visit as well 
00 for a single room which was tiny - no room to swing the proverbial catused the gym which 
the museum is fascinating . 
as a guest we had free access to mona itself , which is great as you can go 
good central location 
in special the guys on the bar of the main swimming pool ( i think his name is patrick 
breakfast in the adjoining restaurant was very nice 
the breakfast room was extremely noisy but a very nice waitress was quick to find us an outside on the 
large comfortable bed with great pillows 
the bar was a pleasant place for a nightcap 
and a restaurant at which i happily ate many meals and which has a nice outdoor deck to take advantage 
location is peaceful ( some ongoing building work at villa suite end of property ) 
location right on the lake so it was great to have the polynesian spa next door 
very friendly and cheerful staff 
the shower was large 
with a tiny sofa bed 
check-out also very easy and the free wifi worked perfectly throughout 
noi at the pool bar was fabulous 
clean and a good size 
besides the complimentary buffet breakfast 
there is a sitting area which a few friends and i were able to relax in to be outside of 
the pool is great and it was hard each day to pull our kids away - unless of course we 
safe plus ample space for an open suitcase 
which has good restaurants and a swim area 
highest floors the better of course 
its a great resort as well 
superb restaurants and excellent breakfast buffet 
i was just staying one night pre a trip on the ghan but chose the mantra partly because of 
as usual the service was except so was the quality and the choice of the food at the food gallery 
the check in and showing to our room by agnes is the best service we have experienced 
there are however two pc 's in reception that are free to use 
the feringgi grill has to be one of the top restaurants in south east asia 
there is a nice bar ( they serve good cocktails - would recommend the dirty martinis ) 
but could n't figure out why with recent renovations 
the dining venues and the accommodations 
the rasa wing swimming pool was lovely and much quieter than the other 
recommend a private half day tour booked through hotel with i-tour - ask for phill 
this heritage resort is absolutely one of the best places to see in this country 
good restaurants nearby but the hotel restaurants are excellent and should be tried 
if you want a resort where you can chill and enjoy the facilities 
perfect for building sand castles 
the last time i visited this hotel was in 2006 when i stayed here as cabin crew 
the bostonian in the basement which was excellent for steaks and the general dining room on the 
service impeccable and breakfast very good 
complimentary soft drinks and coffee thro'out the day 
either by people getting up early or the pool guys keeping them for repeat guests who have the same beds 
the bathroom was a good size although the separate shower was very small 
the rooms are spacious for hong kong at this level 
the hotel spa masseuse also provide pool and beach side services ( for a fee ) 
i have never had such a poor check in experience 
hong kong odyssey superb hotel at club and suite level . 
swimming pool is much better than the rasa swimming pool if you was at the rasa swimming 
but i do n't like to see such blatant evidence of the previous guest when i first enter the 
all in all i will use this hotel in the future when i have an early flight 
should be free in all hotels in my view 
the food and service was so good the first night we had to go back again 
internet though is not free of charge 
the rooms are fine and the evening meal good 
the room was very small & felt a little like a staff canteen 
a very good airport hotel with good food options 
with a 3-day stay recommended by friends we chose a club room with hot and cold running service 
if you like a quiet and not too noisy or busy hotel 
the room had been upgraded for our wedding anniversary and there was wine and a nice card from the management 
my daughter had two young kids with her which made it fairly tight squeeze since the two beds were both 
the al a carte lunch quality is better for the local fare 
fun and very attentive handing out food and topping up drinks non stop 
- friendly and helpful staff at the buffet breakfast- great landscaping- absolutely in love with the trees 
the shangri la hotels are always lovely and this one is no exception 
weekend retreat the visit to shangri-la 's rasa sayang resort was actually 
there 's a lovely spa called the chi 
and eva from lounge ) and also staff members from reception help full 
the location is good with plenty of shopping and a short stroll to the ferry but do n't think 
asian restuarant in hotel v good 
very clean room 
free shuttle bus and parking options 
at it was wonderful to sleep in as it was very dark with the blinds closed and quiet - 
the bed is comfortable and the bathroom well equipped with nice toiletries 
the person checking me in started to explain that they had a free shuttle to georgetown 
no extravagant duvets present but it had provided a generally comfortable ambiance 
beautiful bar area and amazing roof top pool 
the bathroom is also spacious and offers both shower area and a bath tub 
the swimming pool area is lovely and the guys at the pool bar are both keen and attentive 
i was escorted to my room after check-in and i was delighted when i walked in - the 
great welcome at reception 
excellent service - on the ball and no request left unattended it is the pinnacle of four seasons 
it was a typical business hotel buffet 
fairly priced 
beyond doubt the guest rooms are minuscule all the same hygienic and efficiently maintained 
my room was top quality and had a great full-size picture window with a flat screen tv and 
every element of the trip was as close to perfection as one could have hoped for 
the bathroom comes with separate shower and bath 
this hotel is in a beautiful spot so there was some compensation for the rude and surly service in 
no welcome drink provided 
most of the front desk staff are women - can they been any more important or snobby to guest 
front desk and concierge area is very beautiful and will maintained 
bus stand metro station nearby plus taxi round the clock at the hotel 
we had a 2 bedroom suite and the rooms were not evenly air conditioned while one got very hot the 
the hotel has air conditioning which was great for our trip as it was very hot in london that 
our first nights in azerbaijan were spent at the hilton baku which was not 
and the bathroom contained a separate bath and shower 
there are alot of good hotels in london 
very nice decorated and maintained very well 
has a view of the caspian sea and is worth a visit 
it 's the staff that make any property truly special and the staff here are amazing 
we tried the breakfast at the main restaurant and the other two restaurants ( the chinese and the steak 
the location is perfect 
with the location and professional service and staff 
excellent breakfast 
a high-quality spa 
very pleasant reception staff 
very bright decor 
good value for money and ideal if you have are transiting through zurich 
great windows that actually open 
that 's a sign of really good customer service 
for we used this as base to take short trip to cotswold and return to stayroom 
its a business hotel but suitable for tourist as location is very good 
breakfast spread was good and considerable japanese choices ( could be due to ex nikko 
paid for a 1 bedroom suite gave me upgrade to partial ocean view high floor front desk check in was 
which were each of a good size 
at the right price 
the spg recognition was greatly appreciated and i was given a room on the executive floor but as soon 
lights and good sized tvs 
the club lounge was good with plenty of food and drinks served 
and walkable to many restaurants too 
this is only a short walk away and the hotel game keeper is happy to help you see them on 
only 15mins scenic walk to the hustle & bustle of tst 
modern and comfy and the staff were very helpful as well 
spacious bathrooms 
we walked down to the boiling pot next to the zambezi river which was good to do 
tho our view was of the building next door 
much to see in this funky rebuild area like the shopping mall made from shipping containers 
very comfortable bed and pillows 
concierge was helpful and recommended a good local restaurant 
the rooms are always clean 
i was reading the previous reviews of this hotel and i note the manager has started to respond to them 
the wifi was slow but was much faster than borneo rainforest lodge 
botanical gardens and the quake museum 
comfortable and tastefully decorated 
the bathroom was clean with nice toiletries 
my wife and i have stayed at a few lodges and this is one of the best in terms 
food is totally acceptable and the bar area is a great place to relax and chat to other visitors about 
there should be more offered for the relatively high price that is charged 
the only fault i can find was the water pressure was very poor 
there is little if any cross ventilation so the rooms are very hot 
of reasonable size and had a nice bathroom 
even with the big party going on in the hotel they staid calm and helped us to get out 
what did concern me was that during the night of our next day departure i received a bill which included 
so i switched off - but even switched off the a c made a very loud noise and still cold 
modern and with quite some nice amenities 
it should of course be called hilton south quay since it is next to that station 
a great top quality modern hotel for comfortable stays when visiting london 
sound insulation is good except for some voices carrying through bathroom vents ) 
exec lounge is open longer than some others and is open for free drinks from 1800 to 2100 
parking is expensive 44 for valey parking for a dayservice is above averageprice is acceptable 
and there was a great coffee shop up the road that served fantastic beignets 
i had no choice but to completely close the blinds allowing no light whatsoever 
but the dining room was very busy and noisy and on one occasion we ate in the bar to escape 
as with my previous review this hotel has a great hard product 
but an interesting touch and makes morning coffee very easy 
the common areas are meticulously well attended to and the pool bar are perfect spots to lounge in 
there are waterways all over the area so if you desire that kind of feel a great stay location for 
very well laid out along the small beach 
service quality and staffs are great asset for this small resort and food too 
views from the rooftop bar was very nice 
excellent service 
the bathroom in my room was very small and the shower room was extremely small 
it was big for the size of the room 
-a small but fully equipped gym 
minor renovation done 
the beach is really nice and clean and not busy 
great rooftop bar 
the food and service is great 
this we had done by email but on arrival told to park outside in the street as the courtyard was 
the location is excellent 
beware it is pricey and there can be queues to get a table at certain times ( it was 
if you 're looking for a larger villa with several bedrooms 
the hotel was across the road from the train station and getting into venice was a quick 10 minute 
very nice touch 
the hotel has 2 restaurants 
lots of amenities and excellent reception staff 
to sum up it 's good value as a base for venice if you 're not too 
mestre is a run down town which is unpleasant to say the least but has the amazing advantage 
perfectly located in the beautiful old town with a variety of styles from classic to quirky and contemporary 
only reason this hotel did n't get 5 stars is that the shower was a little cool 
i am a frequent visitor to hk but this is the first time i have stayed at the park 
location is however perfect for everything . 
because kix airport is about an hour from central osaka by train ) 
the bathroom was a basic holiday inn sort of space and looked as though they forgot to include it in 
the gym is good 
the room was average and the staff used to volumes of people 
this hotel is very nicely located overseeing the bay and also some nice places in walking distance 
checking in here for a good night 's sleep after a long flight sure beats having to pay the 
there is a lot of positive energy in the air . 
even the housekeeping staff are friendly 
go into hot and cold baths 
views are a given , but you can enjoy a cigar if that is your thing or sit inside 
very strong wifi 
the rooms are modern 
the reception was very busy and with long queues ( perhaps because there was a concert of a popular k 
the food was all very good 
this hotel has small rooms 
the lobby however is like a train station and the usage of the lifts can become very annoying with so 
we stayed at the hampton inn & suites in miami due to a flight change forced on us 
undoubtedly this is the most convenient accommodation if you stopover at kansai airport 
there 's a well-equipped fitness center and a nice little pool too 
many shops and restaurants nearby 
almost ruined my night 's sleepthe bell boy girl will bring your luggage to your room and 
the more spacious lobby is on the 12th floor 
huge windows with great views of the area and blackout shades for privacy 
there is a blackout shade and the room got very dark and so i had good sleep quality in the 
the room was large and the bathroom very good 
there is a lounge and small restaurant on the 12th floor 
and there are plenty of restaurants nearby if you want a simple meal after a long day in the city 
great value for your money 
loom forward to the next trip there 
the breakfast room looks elegant and the service is kind and efficient 
the public rooms and accommodation rooms are a little kitschy for my taste- but clean and in good 
but unfortunately upon check in we were n't giving any information about where to have this breakfast and that 
great little bar & lake of dreams show was great 
in fact every interaction we had with the staff at this hotel was friendly 
then get woken up when i am exhausted saying we wanted to check in how you were doing 
i stayed at mercure nice in december it was being renovated and new tv 's put in 
the staff at this very well located hotel certainly are first rate and will do all they can to help 
great location near all the action 
the service from the hotel staff is exceptional 
at the large hotels connected to the sands i think trip advisor prohibits disclosing the names 
the airport bus drops you right at the doorstep and the concierge staff immediately came to help me 
it is also in a very convenient location 5 minutes walk from victoria 
thus i saw a foreigner complain at the front desk at that morning as he is not noticed for this 
the room service was great 
the lobby is filled with tasteful decorations and the grounds are beautiful 
the sofa bed was hard and uneven 
but for us coming from large city life it was n't anything we could not deal with 
buffet breakfast included for diamond members excellent 
translate the website in english and open the direct booking option on the website 
fast free wifi 
the actual property feels like one that hilton have forgotten a bit 
this place was adequate for the price but not great 
food at the restaurants are fantastic 
nice hotel with a nice shopping area & lovely christmas decorations 
the hotel 's beautiful lobby continues to lure me every single time 
our suite was luxurious and spacious ( way more than we needed ) 
was of a good size 
and it provided great value 
perhaps staying at a lower floor and climbing the stairs will be a good option 
with the combination of hotels like the wynn 
dinner in the restaurant was lovely 
rates were higher than what it is worth but city was full 
even so for the advertised price it 's a good hotel for those wanting a comfortable hotel whilst not 
the room has a decent size for nyc and is fully equiped with bathroom amenities and coffee 
unfortunately was supposed to stay 2 nights hotel was full only stayed one night then moved to a terrible 
which becomes a bit annoying when your trying to enjoy your dinner 
the pool was great 
i had a beautiful view of the pool and the golf course 
the fashion mall is just across the street - go there to get your discounted show tickets - some you 
location wise you are at the heart of mayfair shopping and short walks from both oxford street and 
the villas we stayed in were large with wonderful showers and hot tubs 
the underground is a couple of minues walk 
the wynn and encore gambling floor is the best ( not as crowded and beautiful decor ) 
entrance and lobby is beautiful 
lakeside complementary evening tea and the kids activities were the highlights 
room decent sized for london 
toiletries nice but towels have a not nice smell 
the room door however is not soundproofed , so some noise from doors opening closing in the 
with a particularly tiny bathroom 
the towel warmer is a welcome treat 
if possible get a floor above l20 the views from the floor to ceiling windows and spectacular 
the villa with private pool was a bit small for even a couple 
we especially liked the complimentary internet 
this hotel feels a lot like a cruise ship in aspect 
there are great restaurant choices 
on a quiet side street in tst ( quiet side street is a rare thing anywhere in hk 
self-parking in the hotel garage was very convenient 
i will definitely go back to stanford hillview again on my next trip to hk 
great dinning options 
gorgeous property 
i had faster service on a cruise line 
i found it 'over the top' but i suppose its all about individual taste . 
the room was a good size and the beds comfortable little bit dated but all very clean and tidy 
macy 's is within walking distance and there is a lot of historical stuff right around the hotel 
with good bathrooms 
nice toiletries and a good powerful shower 
and the hotel lobby smelled of mildew 
the rooms are very comfortable and clean 
there was a big bath and a separate walk-in shower 
it is a property made for business travellers with its location next to dubois world trade center and it 
the swimming pool area is not nicely set and there are far too little beds 
the gym and pool were fantastic 
rooms and bathrooms are nicely decorated with walk in showers and huge tubs 
but have nicer amenities 
beautiful rooms and very friendly staff 
very comfortable and clean and a great shower and bathroom 
bathroom was also a good size 
but too cramped to use shower due to sloping wall 
room very comfortable with nespresso machine and all other modern conveniences you could possibly need 
easy to walk into theater country 
they have very nice restaurant 
the room was well equipped and had great quality bed and pillows were excellent as i find this is 
everything is within easy walking distance 
comfortable hotel in great setting 
but lacks any personality or memorable features other than the small but adequate gym which offers great views across the 
rooms comfortable and free internet great 
just off the city circle but easily accessible the radisson is a good value 
the restaurant is good 
i do n't think i have ever been in a tinier room in a major hotel in the 
i really liked the impeccable and warm service at this courtyard 
i guess it met my expectations which of london hotels generally is mediocre at best 
cc hotels are generally good for this 
there was a faint odour of in the room - unsurprising as the windows did n't open 
room allocation and parking made it a great low key business hotel at a good price 
it looked like an earlier occupant had dropped something sticky on it and housekeeping had not cleaned it 
but be warned it is an uphill walk back 
but there are many public buses just outside the door and the trip to causeway bay is not more 
but the gracious staff more than make up for this 
breakfast was well below average and the staff again were terrible 
check in out quick and hassle free 
gym on the roof is very good & the adjoining hot tub is great at night when the city 
you can catch a free shuttle service to radisson flagstaff gardensradisson flagstaff gardens is located 
good buffet breakfast you can buy on a package deal 
my mum and i spent a night at chateau monfort for an overnight visit to la sc 
nice hotel 
just check yours is a little quieter or off otherwise you will have a scare at 3am 
it 's very large with 5 elevators but when full you will be waiting at all times 
the swimming pool and outside area was really nice although the weather was not hot enough for us to try 
elizabeth at check in was so helpful in making my stay perfect 
oh and did i mention there was no shampoo in the bathroom , tv only worked some of the 
a taxi realistically would cost only about 10 
helpful concierge as well 
it was in new york fashion week and the hotel was extremely busy 
filthy and dirty rooms ( the carpet 
and great to have a light breakfast in the garden courtyard of the hotel 
breakfast is pretty much what you 'd get in most budget and mid-range hotels in ind 
there is a nice big lobby area which i sat in while i waited 
please choose a better pricier resort 
i would not advise business trbelers to use this hotel surely not if you want a 
you can get all the extras for free somewhere else 
they also have good conference facilities 
very easy to get transportation and lots of restaurant options nearby 
room decor is modern with pleasing pastel colors 
bathroom was clean and roomy 
the room was also cleaned promptly each day ( as opposed to some hotels where you return at 2pm 
hotel has a small foyer and reception area 
welfare-office attitude at the front desk 
check in was very easy and the room was clean and comfortable 
this could be a disappointing property for some 
mu only suggestion is that the roof top bar should lift their game 
bed was firm and comfortable but the pillows were too soft and no pillow options where given 
you are again greeted by friendly smiles and a real welcome 
and include a built in desk with two chairs ( one a high tech swivel chair with mesh 
i enjoyed this urban fs which sits in a convenient downtown location a block or so from the public market 
the chandigarh baking co cafe deli on the ground floor does good coffee 
this was my second trip to london with immediate bookings 
the staff are uber helpful 
even though i had a late check out they did n't charge me extra 
this is a new hilton property ( formerly the sofitel ) near the stephens convention center 
and an outdoor swimming pool which we did not utilize 
the hotel lobby is shiny and nice looking with lots of hotel staff standing around with no visible purpose 
good amenities 
the smell coming from the beach is really strong and bad 
each staff member i met or witnessed had the upmost professionalism and kindness towards all their guests ( even 
but if you sit on the terrace for a drink in summertime you might find some exhaust fumes 
the palm trees and the ocean early morning are amazing 
rooms r small 
the bathroom had a nice big bath with proper old school taps that filled it up really quickly 
washroom fittings and amenities not modern & inadequate 
check in was top notch and efficient 
it 's a nice hotel 
the staff are outstanding and endeavour to meet your needs 
the main reason we stayed here is the excellent setting- overlooking the beach and palm trees 
also the resort is quite spread out and it is quite a hike to the main building if in one 
and we were upgraded to a nice suite 
get a high floor room to avoid bad smell and better view 
clean rooms 
which is a nice plus 
everything seemed perfect with friendly check in and the beautifully decorated lobby 
nice building 
good restaurants nearby 
and was disappointed by the service levels and quality of the hotel 
the raffles restaurant is noisy and chaotic 
the location is perfect and walking distance to central park 
- rooms are tiny ( and my room was on the elite members floor ) - the bedding was 
on the desk was a large tray with a stainless steel ice bucket and tongs but no drinking glasses 
rooms were spacious and clean but shower gel was not supplied 
restaurant at ground floor was good 
great gym & spa 
i complained 2 more times and after the 3rd time was switched to a room on the 28th 
convenient and pleasant stay 
the room was quite small as well as the bathroom 
wifi is a paid-for extra 
i have seen the complex on several previous visits to dubai but never had the opportunity to stay there 
nice amenities for marriott platinum members including welcome reception and complementary breakfast 
business center had five computers with free internet access and a printer 
busy lobby 
the room is spacious and luxurious like most hotels in this city 
the hotel is in a great location and staff are nice to me 
the service really made my stay at this property -- from friendly & efficient front desk 
river view but eccentric location on river is not really a plus , a bit remote from city centerabs 
the rooms need an urgent renovation and the beds mattress look like they should have been taken out of service 
1 ) this is a pet friendly property 
the bathroom was spacious and clean 
i may have found more things to pick at like a rather small lobby 
my room was typically marriott which means spacious by london standards 
the bathroom was roomy and had a large bathtub and shower 
everything that you ask for a marriott with tea making facilities and a good solid and comfortable bed 
which although not in the luxury category offers excellent value for money 
beds are very comfortable and rooms are spacious 
the nearby mall has everything 
and a slow internet connection cost an additional gbp9 
with good facilities mand helpful staff 
the bed was huge and super comfy 
this is one of the best hotels i have stayed at in new york and i highly recommend it 
two minor complaints 
huge desk table dominates the room but only one weird desk chair 
beautiful hotel in city centre with the most spacious room u can expect in scandinavia front 
i also like their environmentally friendly touches 
same as check out 
the main train station 
my suite was beautiful 
it is an old hotel but they have maintained it very well 
polite and professional staff you expect in this region 
separate shower and great beds 
the property is about to become a sofitel 
the bathroom is excellent 
though it is a high ceiling room 
although it is in lively area but it few step aways from noisy surroundings 
we ate dinner one night in the hotel as it was raining very heavy 
the chef michael was from burma and made authentic thai food 
there is free internet access in the lobby of the hotel 
a short walk from embankment charing cross and a single change ( kensington ) from 
it would be pretty easy to trip and fall in the middle of the night 
decent hotel in kowloon for us 100 per night rooms that face shanghai street i 
stayed one night there as usual hotel ( gate away marco polo ) was full and only 
firstly i must say that the resort is very beautiful 
the buffet food was hot and the choice was more than we expected 
the room are clean and tidy 
the hotel also has a large selection of books ( multiple languages ) and games in a annex just to 
it has good restaurants 
extreme end of luxury 
excellent hotel i read some bad reviews of this property , but booked it anyway as it was such 
there are better options including at better locations at the price point charged by the hotel for virtually no value 
it was a lovely large room with a king size and single bed 
beds and bedding is superb and so is sleep quality 
great location though 
the common areas are spectacular with 3 humongous infinity pools and a beautiful private beach 
we got a nice room on the seventh floor with a great view 
central - easy access to regent street 
i spent 4 nights in this hotel on a business trip and while i loved the posh surroundings and 
large resort on a stunning beach 
i lost my wedding ring in the south china sea while i was throwing a ball with my son 
it is well situated on the corner of bond street which means you can go shopping luxurious brands or walking 
this combined with charging guests for wifi just seems so petty to me 
it would also be good if the restaurant staff could get the breakfast charges correct - under what seems a 
great restaurants and maintained impeccably 
they accorded same level rooms for our friends who came in earlier 
check-in was easy and efficient and hotel staff was friendly 
would return as very good value for money 
the complimentary coffee on offer was nescafe - not acceptable 
the location is convenient without being right in the middle of the action 
we stayed one night at hi express 
the food is good and reasonably priced for the quality and the luxury of the hotel 
having the luxury of your own private huge pool and being able to walk down onto the beach was certainly 
the hotel was very quiet and the bathroom very clean 
very nicely decked out and has some basic gym equipment there which is a bonus as express properties would 
the receptionist felt bad himself and finally volunteered to leave the desk and take the luggage 
noise levels are lower and the crowd is significantly less 
the rooms is new and colours are fresh 
had room service one night which arrived promptly and was good quality 
other tourists and i were all complaining how slow and inefficient the staff is . 
nice property 
short walk to beach 
there is not much in the immediate area ( 3 blocks ) 
do go up to the 24th floor for the outdoor sky lounge 
the two slides are so much fun and having a pool access room is worth it to maximize your times 
ok it 's a hotel that 's a training facility but the rooms and facilities are first class 
we stayed there for 3 nights in late august 
we chose to stay at the t hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and although the reviews were an 
no proper attention paid to the cleanliness of sauna 
especially the extra bed for my daughterbig fish bar & grill 
but we enjoyed the wait as long as it for someone 's development 
this is a family friendly resort with a pool and play area for kids and an adult pool as well 
plus there is a shuttle bus provided 
the bathroom was clean 
it is very well located to the centre of the city and a short walk to old town 
i enjoyed a complimentary upgrade to a suite and enjoyed the high-floor view of the city along with 
nice average business hotel - needs air 
but pools were excellent 
but in our opinion it is n't anything else than your average hotel breakfast with different kinds of yo 
there are many cheaper and better alternatives outside hua hin center 
but aside from that it was just a typical hotel 
brilliant central location and nice terrace bar 
the toilet bowl had an unpleasant smell for the few days that we stayed 
so you should book one well in advance 
saying that london hotels are overpriced is a pleonasm 
if you are taking a superior room with pool view 
the hotel is very expensive 
higher floors less car noise from car-parkl 
my room was spacious 
this is a newer building 
almost no internet connection this is typical and very good hiexpress where we have stayed durin 
the wifi was great too 
service is excellent and the rooms are really nice - food in the hotel is exceptiona good and the 
extensive free breakfast including hot items - bacon 
it advertises high speed internet 
the exterior of the hotel and lobby are attractive but everything else is motel standard 
very warm rooms 
just near the beaches and park and the cappuccino strip and the weekend market 
spacious with a great bed 
the room has everything you require and was lovely and clean and the property must be quite new as the 
front bar is very comfortable and has a decent wine list to boot 
the lobby is awful and the walk to the room with bags toooooo far 
the property is close to restaurants 
the hotel 's location is very convenient for access to both darling harbour and chinatown 
check-in and check out were very easy and the staff were extremely friendly and polite 
great property in a great location 
the hotel has a modern and open reception and lobby 
ask if the building work next door has completed and whether your room is near the floor entry to your 
bathroom appointments were great 
but much of the immediate area abuts construction sites 
approachable and helpful while our room was spacious 
location is very central and the public car park is next to the hotel which is free of staying less 
the club floor is absolutely lovely 
decent hotel in central location 
they give you free access to a fitness club outside the hotel which was at best average 
the other thing they have is when you log onto the wi-fi you can access their online news 
breakfast a little pricey 
it costs less every night 
the front desk staff is extremely professional and happy to help with anything you need 
the staff are very helpful and friendly 
the business centre computer are dreadfully slow - over the 4 days i stayed every computer was the same 
the facility is nice and the rooms are more than adequate 
but these are small niggles 
the staff were very helpful and parking was easy to find nearby 
good a c and safe 
great location 
but is great value for money 
we enjoyed this property very much during a recent trip to bangkok 
it is positioned in a great spot in that it straddles the space between the darling harbour precinct 
and the entire soi 11 has more food options that you will ever need for a short holiday 
in the lobby the hotel offers several pcs with internet access for guest use 
incidentally we paid 90 per night for a family of three which i thought was very good value 
so taking my shirts and suit i went down to the basement to find a laundry and the said iron 
we did visit some of the tourists sites which were very busy but the hotel staff were great in recommending 
which was a nice soft sandy beach 
the amenities are nice and the gym provides enough equipment for a good workout 
we had requested a top floor room prior to arrival and were allocated a room on the top floor ( 
breakfast served with sparkling which is very good value 
mario is a real charmer and has made our stay extra special 
hotel is close to airport 
staff friendly and helpful when you got face to face with them - but long queues 
upon arrival you see this very interesting & modern building 
bathrooms ( well mine anyway ) are shower only 
the beach options are less private 
the walk to the metro station is less than 5 minutes 
the bed is hard 
we had trouble with our travel agent aot travel2 incorrectly booking the wrong hotel 
bella sky comwell is located somewhat far outside the city center on a vast open field 
we purchased the hotel & flight together and found it was excellent value for money 
so getting around to other parts of the city is fairly easy 
the centre hotels are extremely expensive so the bella sky is a good option even though a bit outside 
good location to stay if new to hong kong as very central and all manner of modes of 
i ordered room service twice and was very satisfied with what i received 
the bathroom is a decent size too 
the hotel and transfer to from airport worked fluently 
with seperate bathroom equally as small but a nice touch with bathrobes and slippers available 
very friendly staff 
free shuttle bus from and to airport 
the room is quite spacious 
i would n't stay here for more than a night or when travelling privately as the location is not 
and give personal service 
my advice is to plan ahead and find one of the many deals available in proper hotels 
the reception is friendly and helpful 
overrated , so expectations were too high although the brufani is a small leading hotel of the 
the rooms are clean and comfortable but the decor in our junior suite was very dated 
we were accommodated in an elegant recently refurbished room on the second floor with a stunning view overlooking 
having been let down by their sister hotel i was transferred to this hotel and am i glad they did 
there is a small fridge in the room that i can only describe as filthy - a couple bottles of 
coffee made for you 
the wine is priced to quality but beer is a little expensive 
the staff were very friendly though 
the motel is clean well maintained and the king sized bed comfy 
the carpet was heavily stained and the walls are exposed bricks . 
the room itself is clean 
in room 56 when lifted the toilet seat would not stay up . 
no carpark located on site but just across the road 
it should have its own facilities 
so what with the noisy and thin walls i did n't get much rest 
i chose this hotel because it is close to airport and also provides the free shuttle airport transfer 
the bar area is quite nice and prices more than attractive 
dining area at front of hotel overlooking north terrace which created a nice ambience 
in the standard room opposite 
decent value for london 
the facilities were excellent and view was great 
the hotel is very new and has very good hardware 
coffee table and a large plasma tv 
but the menu was different to the one in birmingham 
price and the brilliant staff 
and room 623 very welcoming 
defiantly an improvement with the front desk staff needed 
towels are fluffy 
thankyou hotel giraffe for a lovely stay 
the fridge and coffee tea-making facility are located outside 
you can see the temple from the terrace while you are having breakfast 
the bathroom and shower too were of an excellent quality 
facilities are top notch 
great hotel until you need something stayed 4 nights for a little get away with the wife to check out 
and plenty of places nearby for coffee groceries 
it also offers separate shower and tub 
stayed here for a large conference when the city is completely sold out 
close to main train station 
it 's practically opposite the train station 
we love the bathroom and the industrial look 
the train station is also right next to he hotel 
though if street noise bothers you then you might want to request a higher floor - i was on 11 
very central and convenient to commute into town 
the restaurant is above average and the bar is a local hot spot 
walking distance to old town 
there were hair on our new towels and some dirt 
there is no direct tube line 
i 've only stayed at one other 
we were upgraded to the next room category and the room was fine 
a particular thanks to the concierge who was very helpful in organising a bike tour through central park 
roof top lounge bar with a view of the park ( central park ) and 
the staff was great 
bar staff were lovely and the burger we shared at the bar was one of the best we 've 
the meeting rooms are nice and the buffet lunches well prepared 
but on weekends a lot of shops restaurants are close 
1307 has a soft king bed 
but poor soundproofing 
would definitely stay again 
conveniently located exactly next to mrt station 
there is even a free business lounge with nice snacks and drinks 
hotel is near the train station which is 2-3 min walk away and there is a star 
nice service at breakfast 
there is a subway station right outside and you are within walking distance to many shops 
my room on the 20th floor indeed had an excellent view of taipei 101 and this was 
this was first visit to tawain and it has so much to see i would certainly stay at 
higher floors are always better 
the bed was comfortable with good quality linen and fluffy towels in the bedroom 
modern and with one of the best beds available 
fantastic rooms with brilliant service right in the heart of hong kong 
the higher the floor - the better the view 
let me say the staff were always friendly and deserve a gold star for executing wishes to a very high 
the hotel is ideally situated in central hong kong 
what a great city 
the center ) nice bar ( with interesting bird-shaped drinks ) - no onsite gym- very 
a number of main sights within walking distance 
ideal for cigar smokers like i am 
rooms were modern business traveller equipped & certainly spacious unlike other close proximity to the hamburg hauptb 
the front desk could care less about your visit 
to the hotel 's front desk staff ) and the breakfast food choices were very good 
the first night one was n't available but was able to get one for the following nightsover 
there were chairs and bottled water so it was great to sit down and relax while the agent searched for 
excellent locationcomfortable high quality beddingfriendly staffclean and tidylarge ish room for 
very nice staff 
we had problems with hot water on the first 2 nights and the engineer fixed it for us super fast 
a noisy shower door was quickly taken care of with one phone call 
is quite a nice city 
while its not meant for people who want to be pampered like crazy or for a wonderful honey 
the beds are comfortable and the shower as strong as an american shower should be 
the breakfast buffet is good and has a broad variety of asian and western delicacies 
the swimming pool was child friendly and the kids club was decent but the water was a bit cold for 
reception staff very polite and just a great funky vide to the whole hotel 
that 's when we decided never ever to stay in this highly priced hotel 
big luxurious brands nearby etc 
we got a room an a high floor with a beautiful view of new york 
the rooms are well kept and the staff were very helpful 
my heavenly bed sagged badly around the back area 
breakfast on the 3rd floor was good also 
it 's the best value to come out of hk in a long time 
this makes moving around the city quite easy especially with the ace subway lines just next to the hotel 
service - i did n't experience westin service standards due to some lapses as mentioned above 
i would highly recommend this hotel to business travelers or families interested in staying close to the theater district 
there is a small 'business centre' with limited free internet access 
the side which has a window that opens is situated on the main street 
it 's convenient for time square as well as for getting to all parts of midtown . 
we had a 2 queen bed room which was great 
with natural stone floor 
many restaurants offering good variety of food can be found in the vicinity 
will stay again when i am back 
it was my first time staying here and i must say i was really impressed 
i am an accor member and i was welcomed on arrival with everything prepared and given a room on 
not only was the air conditioner noisy but the fridge was so noisy i had to turn that off 
it would be possible to walk but would be a bit much with luggage 
the doormen and police at the entrance are a nice addition to a stay in new york 
shower ok 
it 's good value for the price we paid 
tired basic type of hotel 
this is a really good budget hotel in a convenient area for people transiting or wanting to stay close 
i stay here every time i visit hong kong and the location is very good 
the staff are great and the rooms are clean and comfortable - typical ibis style 
large open plan breakfast area ( taman sari brasserie 
the wifi is super fast and the location is excellent for shopping and eating 
the hotel is located in the heart of the city 
near the airport - unusual bathroom 
the rooms are large by hk standards 
so used the hotel shuttle 
it had one small window which did open but you do n't want to open it as o' 
the staff were great 
though it is probably filling but one does miss a buffet when you are at hotels while travelling 
very helpful and friendly front desk staff 
arriving at 7pm after a long flight from sydney i was shocked to be told 
good priced hotel near sydney airport 
front desk staff are friendly most of the time and very efficient 
when we arrived at the hotel istana we were delighted with the personal service we received so late 
do go for the higher floors 
close to restaurants and most of the important sites 
there 's free wifi in the room and free breakfast 
loads of choice and top notch food 
and was really good value 
the quality was very good and the price was perfectly affordable considering the inflatinf prices of iceland 
with a comfortable bar and lounge off to one side 
i went to ask help from one gentleman at front desk about the chinese translation if it is correct 
outstanding value 
there was a long wait for lunch 
the people on reception were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay here 
the fitness room is ok and the food for breakfast is good 
our room was clean and comfortable and the food in the restaurant was good 
to compare this stay with last time 
the hotel is quiet old and even the front desk staff is trying to be friendly 
reasonably priced restaurant . 
a boutique feel and nice sized rooms - all very clean and comfortable 
as if they were hosting you in the own home- a relaxed bar to chill out- a real 
it seems to be an adequate size for new york 
there is a massive construction site next door and across the road 
not helped by black carpet 
gorgeous toiletries 
glass top tables not clean 
the pillows fabulous and the shower was great 
the hotel pool is nice but the pool bar does n't seem like it has been used in decades 
the free internet access worked well 
free internet was available in room and all common areas 
hardly any place to put your clothes and no separate toiletthe hotel is located right off the 
made so by the gracious hotel manager 
a service that most luxurious hotels have long since forgotten 
as with the public areas 
and it gives a very special touch to your stay 
separate shower and loo with attractive marble and quality toiletries 
however the staff were helpful 
my husband and i always go for the best located hotel as we like to walk to everywhere 
we could walk to many excellent restaurants and catch a taxi or walk to most of the attractions 
the bathroom was also great with la prarie ( love 
breakfast costs were very reasonable and the honey granola yogurt parfait was delicious 
the best warm , friendly and caring atmosphere . 
extremely spacious ( full 1-bedroom flat with large living room 
good size bathroom and kitchen 
would definitely stay here again 
i tried ordering room service and the reuben sandwich was yummy 
concierge and front desk staff could not have been more helpful3 
the staff are very friendly and attentive and the lack of casino is 
for those who want to be off the strip & avoid casino crowd this is a good place 
food for 50 for breakfasts and lunches with large groups is skimpy and over priced 
secondly the valet only parking is a real issue for many people with rental cars - you are 
but very nice hotel rooms 
with separate shower and tub 
another fine kimpton hotel 
it almost looks like mold 
great decor 
adequate rooms with comfy beds in ok location 
the pool is slightly smaller than expected 
there are some restaurants nearby and the italian restaurant at the lobby was pretty good 
lobby not very nice and breakfast not the best 
above floor 15 is actually level 16 where the gym is 
well decorated and have windows that open 
the 3pm late checkout however was excellent 
huge bathroom with separate large shower 
large jetted tub was a plus as was the large well stocked bathroom 
crawfish in nearby streets 
extremely friendly front desk 
rooms are like a pod with very limited space and amenities 
the staff are keener on talking to their friends than serving customers - not good 
breakfast was again standard buffet with something for everybody 
a good size bathroom and a very comfortable bed made for a happy stay 
but the room was great 
dry sauna 
the whole ambience is outdated and the service level is unpredictable 
kept hot and decanted bars good went to restaurant rose gardens one night sunday ok but probably worst 
i arrived early evening with a taxi paying 38 euros and was checked in quickly and then escorted to my 
the bride and groom scored a suite on the 62nd floor looking straight down the strip and the view 
i have not seen a complementary bar anywhere else which has 
the bathroom was also nice and the shower very powerful 
after a long flight i just wanted to get checked in and go to my room 
some decent restaurants in the area as well 
300 for the same nights on the hotel website ) 
rooms at the top floors ( i got a room on a 9th floor ) have less street noise 
the restaurant staff slowly warmed up a bit after initial snottiness but the food was not nearly good 
which stop me giving this the full 5 stars are that when we arrived on the first day at 5 
ibis is located in a central position and is a practical hotel 
our first visit to the city 
i used the little gym- which was ok 
mine on the 12th floor was very quiet 
the check in was quick and the bed comfortable 
there was a dressing alcove before the large bathroom with its usual comforts like safe 
the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful 
the concierge was able to secure us a fixed price taxi ( at higher cost of course ) 
all easy walks 
it is possible to walk to the small town area which has things like coles 
very good breakfast 
stylish cave with a large wet room instead of a bathroom where absolutely everything got soaked when you took 
i prefer staying closer to the area of siam as this is more industrial section of town 
the bathroom is one of these open plan bathrooms where you have no privacy if sharing a room 
fantastic location and great price 
only criticism is small size of shower gel not being adequate enough for two people two showers 
you ca n't beat staying next to a hotel if you are taking an early flight out 
for a very cheap price 
great location 
good lounge area and wet room shower bathroom area 
just stayed at this property on our last trip with my daughter 
this is clearly an historic building ( nearly a hundred years old ) 
but more expensive than in the restaurants on small streets between the hilton hotel and the centara 
with several pools 
we found the garden rooms overlooking the garden pool ( ground floor ) were in a great location 
clean and big rooms 
nice bar to relax in 
with 3 swimming pools all clean with plenty of sunbeds 
the bathroom was of good size and well laid-out 
the cocktails were excellent and the bar staff were quite friendly 
but without a good nights sleep and a decent shower in the morning 
hotel check-in is efficient and friendly and must mention the concierge team who were super 
the service by the hotel staff is excellent 
we had a good sized bathroom with a huge walk in shower and lots of good quality toiletries and 
the gym sleek and modern 
the lobby is grand and old-fashioned 
good hairdryer 
however for one night it was fine and the bed was very comfortable 
with sufficient sofas for you to wait or hang around if you wish to 
the shopping district is a short walk across the danube canal 
as the entrance is open to all to wander in from the side street it appeared many may not be 
especially if hotels closer to the centre or paddington are too expensive 
choose a higher floor 
their resturant is on 18th floor and is a gathering spot for the who 's who 
the pool is really nice with a bar snack area that serves the pool 
com and was very good value if i was to visit lisbon again i would stop there 
we were not smiled upon , we spend time flagging down waiters for tea , coffee , 
and had everything you could expect from a good quality hotel 
overall staff at reception were nice and responsive 
the front desk staff were either abundantly helpful and friendly 
the free hour of phone calls around the world is an amazing treat 
very comfortable and relaxing sofitel bed 
the view is great but it is a bit of a long ( pleasant ) walk to the city 
everything is quite convenient - free wifi 
room is very well appointed 
on of the best hotels i have ever stayed in 
the room was huge for europe with large windows and unobstructed views for miles around berlin 
this level of service carries through to the restaurant staff the front desk and housekeeping 
the bed was very comfortable 
it had an outside terrace 
front desk is attentive and willing to help 
the shoreditch area which is vibrant 
certainly a place i look froward to staying at the next time i am in melbourne 
the bed was in that really comfortable american style where your feet ca n't touch the floor when 
front desk staff were always friendly and helpful 
they can bring a portable ac unit to your room and exhaust out the window - noisy and open to 
a place to stay without breaking the bank clean , neat , very convenient from the airport and to central 
but front desk offers this service if you ask 
everyone from the cleaners to the go 's to the manager are very friendly and i will not hesitate 
however the hotel bar windows is nice and rooms are nice but they need service and i wont go 
the bathroom is especially lovely 
awesome adult pool 
i cannot speak highly enough of the bed 
club lounge have limited choices and few selection in general 
the free drinks snacking concept is great 
the duke of wellington 's house is very close and well worth a visit 
as a point to mention - i did try their gluten free bread on this trip 
the hotel staff were perfect with the check in and the concierge service was extremely efficient and friendly 
i travel a lot and normally stay in hilton 's 
an adult pool if you want some peace and quiet or head to the beach if you want to try 
the food is more luxury & better cooked 
rooms spacious and well decorated and the services were fab 
the hotel is somewhat showing a little age in decor however well maintained 
well worth a visit 
i usually walk down to the starbucks for an expensive cup of coffee and get some pastry near by 
was here for an event found the banquet team very efficient - since it was a small exhibition so most 
as were the comfy chairs and the views 
i had asked for a room with one big bed but they were only able to offer me one with 
the rooms are typical hotel rooms with a good work area and the lounge is not huge but is is 
breakfast hotel restaurant is good 
so overall you put up with a little scruffiness as it is a special place 
they did not tidy the tables or dispose of empty bottles of water which i found rather strange 
there is nothing that justifies a good rating in this hotel 
a good business hotel with clean room 
room was fresh and clean typical hilton good quality 
ritz carlton had done a good job for my family and left us an unforgettable memory for 
the bar is great and the suspended wine cellar is a feat of engineering 
it 's a lovely treat with facilities that relax you and provide the ultimate environment to unwind before 
the concierge was very helpful in giving directions on the best ways of getting to and best times 
carmen from the front desk was truly excellent 
uncomfortable beds and bedding is beyond me 
it was just unfortunate that there was a storm on our supposed to be arrival and our trip was cut 
i would say one the best spa i have ever been as the facilties are quite modern and 
unfortunately on a balmy saturday night the patrons of a nearby restaurant were loud and boister 
all too typical of hotels in australian cities 
ordered room service the one night and the food was delicious 
car parking was easy 
great gym facilities that were a bit busy 
our stay overnight was marred by a very poor dinner in the ordinary restaurant ( not the fine dining 
a 5 munite walk also takes you to the crown casino 
at one corner of the piazza in front of santa maria novella 
the only bad thing about all that was having to work with the stairway to get to and from 
there was a dfo outlet with many stores next door 
i was upgraded to a higher category without fuss to meet my requirement for a double room 
twice is enough to get a good or a bad vibe from a hotel and this one really didnt 
the city view is also better than the bay view 
almost too brisk ( at check-in ) lacking a bit of personal touch a weary traveller would like 
they were trying to be super modern and achieved that but at the cost of functionality 
afrenoon tea is supposed to be a feature but the pricing was a turn-off 
if you get a good value here 
and the bathroom included a separate tub and shower 
a high floor 
apart from the check-in area cum lounge bar cum 5pm friday nightclub there seemed to 
worth splurging a bit on the small suite 
car park is attached 
dirty bed-side tables 
otherwise the hotel is nice 
the major shopping gear of the city is a gentle 10 minute walk away and the hotels large underground car 
the worst hotel that i stayed at while on business 
still listen very often to several cd bought thererooms little small but liked the bath window connectedlast visit 
i had a cool corner room and really enjoyed the view of nyc 
note that the traffic in quito is awful and it can take 40-60 minutes to get to 
close to a number of excellent restaurants and not too far away from the famous old town 
the staff are your typical new yorkers and that 's normally bad but they all have the 
nice executive lounge with good breakfast 
a little bit pricey 
a well stocked mini bar and beautiful robes 
the towering lobby bar with unique light show and stacked wine bar reaching ridiculous heights 
glass elevators are located across the spacious lobby 
lovely modern decor and stylish bathroom with a very cool shelf tap combo and fab bliss toiletries 
shopping at the airport is less than a two minute walk away and the hotel has a great bar 
nicely appointed and impeccably clean roomsgreat location if you want to be in the heart on the 
food in the cafe and executive lounge was very good 
i was heading to the gal pagos islands for a cruise and the booking included a 2 night stay 
it is not worth staying here even if you arrive late into zurich ( like we did ) 
the hotel taxis can take you to old town and wait while you walk around 
quite convenient as everything is walkable and the action is at times square 
nice to be able to walk to and from terminal and railway station 
has 4 very nice pools and generally top notch facilitiesthe not so good 
the rooms are very modern and comfortable - 5 star 
very quick and friendly and rooms were large and decent appointed 
the shower is an over bath affair - ok but again would expect a separate shower at this price 
i stayed here for one night as i had an early morning flight the next day 
decent amenities 
my room was extra large 
4 nights at this great hotel 
excellent free wifi 
really top notch spot in the heart of quieter kensington 
the food in the restaurant and room service are both very good 
eating and shopping 
clean and all the amenities you would expect from a hyatt 
very high ceilings 
we also had to ask for more tea . 
perfectly located in the city centre 
very expensive room rates 
the hotel is attached to the airport very convenient with train station below and with lots of food options a 
considering i could have had a similar room in any of several nearby 5-star hotels at half 
the olympus club has a nice swimming pool and jacuzzi 
for an airport hotel its all fairly typical 
two downsides - we were on the street side on the 6th floor and it was still rather 
big nice bed 
you 'll enjoy great hospitality 
with numerous amenities 
the rooms appear to have been recently renovated so the decor was updated and the furnishings were in great 
the park hyatt was amongst the handful of hotel options available 
the bathrooms was large 
the hotel is housed near the main train station in a middle-end shopping centre ( next to c 
considering its location and what you pay for a room and this hotel is really good value especially if 
hoped to give them a higher rating 
relatively quiet street 
but it is not in a very nice street and there is better in new york for the same 
shabby carpet 
the haymarket for me is the original version of the crosby street hotel in new 
other than the main pool there was a spa area which i did n't get a chance to visit 
the rooms are very nice and well maintain 
the breakfasts were delicious and plentiful and the other meals were top class 
the room came with english breakfast which basically was all items on the a la carte breakfast menu and 
the catered food and the conference rooms are great 
convenient hotel located at the airport 
having stayed at other hotels in this small boutique chain 
our best stay in london 
hotel may be ok but access is a disaster 
the first surprise was that we got upgraded to a suite ( when you are staying with your mother for 
we really feel that we got our money 's worth in staying at the haymarket 
the views are spectacular and it is the type of place you could spend hours just sitting on the 
nice canapes in the evening could only be improved by bottle of sparkling wine as well as the red 
i have to say i stayed at the hyatt regency at dallas fort worth airport due to 
it had a nice bed and good toiletries 
there were dirt marks on the white floor and wall 
the hotel is overall very good 
only 15 min easy walk 
the breakfast has a wide selection of items 
coffee and tea selection not good in room for this quality hotel 
executive lounge was nice 
the lobby was great for our large group to hang out and socialize 
the spacious bedroom and car parking 
pool area very nice but quite small 
very nice front desk staff are quite helpful 
as well as a big gym and nice pool it made for a great stay 
flat pillows and carpets that were a little less fastidiously clean than i like them 
while at night there 's a nice view from the top . 
my expectations of central london hotels is somewhat tempered by knowledge of how difficult it can be to find 
being in central london you expect a bit of noise outside which there was but nothing that impacted on 
large bathroom with bathtub and shower too 
the bar is amazing and you can bump into any world class celebrities here from karl lagerfeld 
breakfast was a little more disappointing in the sense of buffet but the hot meals ( ordered ) were 
the location is great as well 
the bathroom was very nice - two sinks were separate from the toilet and shower which is always good 
we were here for almost a week and i have to say that this is one of my best hotels 
we stayed for two nights and had a great experience 
a very poor experience overall 
the hotel also has a nice terrace with a small pool 
with a michelin 3 star dining at your disposal 
i revisited the website and saw the wonderful pool and beach photo but interestingly there was not a crow 
beneath the surface is a somewhat different side 
i went in for a late lunch and was going to skip buffet dinner that was included 
nice enough pool 
in a nice area 
and the statement that they come with a sofa bed is completely untrue 
i had a brief stay in a grand deluxe suite which included a lounge area and full bath on 
chalets are right on the beautiful beach but rooms a bit too small for a family 
very nice pool with an absolutely amazing beach on your doorstep 
would go back as the beach is lovely and overall we had an enjoyable time for a couple of nights 
the lobby with beautiful decorations around its fireplace was very attractive 
several areas dusty and marked 
ca n't comment on food as we ate out all the time though coffee and wine in the lounge 
with a good bathroom and large bed 
roomy and great lobby area for meetings 
rooms are spacious . 
there were 2 areas which were disappointing 
tesco express and waitrose near by and great shopping at westfields london at 
impressive large foyer 
bed is heavenly perfect and the butler is so helpful especially for a first timer in florence 
the kitchenette is a plus and i really liked the breakfast 
great business hotel 
nice breakfast buffet is available 
30pm drinks and snacks as well as free internet 
a big fridge and washing machine 
if quality of accomodation and service are high on your list of importance 
location is great just next to the tube station 
there is no separate shower- you have to shower in the tub 
the continental breakfast was really good compared to a lot of included breakfasts we have had in the 
a good alternative for a moderately priced hotel 
room is not a bad size and the bathroom was great with a nice big shower and strong hot water 
rooms are quite nice and spacious and located centrally in the city 
the breakfast was modest as it 's an ibis but good enough if you 're not too 
i found the room 's price too expensive for the value of what you get 
it is also on the side where within easy walking distance to the restaurants in east terrace and north 
a reasonable size 
fitness centre and pool on top floor very nice 
the front desk 's answer was maybe they were busy and it was a big day 
you can have the buffet which looked good 
the staff were friendly and efficient 
only at the lobby . 
friendly and nice staff 
so the parking place on the same building is also quite convenient 
steam room and sauna were all good and these made the difference between this hotel and the nov 
bathroom had seperate tub and shower 
they all seemed to recognize us by name after our first visit 
last year the a la carte menu was very good 
decent location but on busy road so fair amount of traffic noise 
but food pricing is absurdly inflated to rip-off levels 
well located in mendoza with the restaurants close by 
bed was good but the room looked as if it could do with a good re-decoration 
this hotel has nothing to do with the park hyatt characteristics besides good location in mendoza 
would love to stay here again . 
very nice swimming pool 
to the reception and the concierge 
the rooms are very small and the bathroom was not upto standard 
fairly close to the beach ( 5 min walk ) 
the rooms are great and perhaps a little larger than the average london hotel room 
wifi was fast and lounge had quality offerings on hand 
washroom was large and nice amenities but showing its age 
the pool was not completed and i missed out 
food was fantastic but a little on the pricey side 
very consistent and quality 2 ) 
an excellent hotel at a pretty reasonable price for central london 
plus you have great restaurants around the hotel 
with a refreshing mint drink and smile 
for our next visit to honolulu 
after basically being kicked out of the adult pool 
we stay in partial ocean view and loved the experience beautiful pools and the morimoto resturant was 
the pool and bars have a great vibe 
excellent swimming pool with heated water allows swimming in winter 
i think this is a basic business hotel and less suitable for tourists 
soft fluffy towels - free sunscreen 
the gentleman receptionist i turned to was not helpful or sympathetic 
and my husband and i had very cold showers to the point where i was freezing cold and struggling to 
which are to die for if you 're looking for a relaxing day- and the wait staff are 
i was at this hotel for 3 nights it left me with a sour taste in the mouth 
thanks modern crew we take away warm feelings about our stay with you 
the original room allocated was awful - facing a parking lot 
great people but rooms & bathrooms very small for a renovated 4 star hotel 
and worth the price although a tad old 
i have stayed often in the other in-terminal hotel in terminal 1 
the hotel lobby is small and noisy 
detracted from the overall good experience 
easy to find and fast checkin 
with superb little buildings and excellent rooms which are large and comfortable 
prices were a little high but not still reasonable- and they threw in a good continental breakfast and 
there room also smelled stale and smokey 
full range of elemis toiletries provided breakfast was great with very good quality ingredients usedservice excellent throughout 
tea & hot chocolate is replaced daily & there is a small refrigerator 
caesars is the granddaddy of the big vegas casino and not until bellagio 
drinks reasonable 
there are much nicer and cheaper hotels in vegas 
45 am could n't check out due to police situation by front deskmachines in casino old 
the breakfast buffet was excellent 
the hot tubs are nice 
comfortable spacious room 
the minus - expensive underground parking 
the bed was large ( the size of two singles ) and pleasantly firm 
furniture is dated and the decor is unattractive 
the hotel is very centrally located in the cbd with a wide choice of dining and sightseeing options 
the breakfast buffet was one of the very best i have experienced anywhere 
good restaurants nearby at st katherines dock 
the business class rate includes one drink from the mini bar ( which was locked ) so we went to 
having arrived early in the morning after a long flight 
definitely the right spot for a good nights sleep 
check in was top notch 
that fits the extra bed 
shuttle bus often full and does n't seem to stick to their published timetable 
we stayed two nights and the lobby is gorgeous 
it is in an older building--but one that has personality and style 
the room was small but cozy and clean 
they also have a micro brewery with exotic cherry beer and the likes 
hotel was n't full and front desk gave us a view of the parking lot 
restaurants and supermarket is within walking distance 
its in a very local area of hong kong so you have to travel a distance to get 
close to tube stations and the park 
which one of two main hotels in the village 
the fit-out of the place was very grand with high ceilings and classic royal colours and marble throughout 
it was n't high luxury and i would n't recommend it as a romantic gettaway but 
what an amazing hotel the beautiful building it is and the wonderful location 
you can do better then this one for the same price 
at the second dinner 
my wife loved the classical furniture and i appreciated the space for my business things 
all the tv channels and a comfy bed plus a decent bathroom make the radisson blu plaza hotel 
sometimes on wotif as a secret deal and therefore at a fantastic price 
the concierge makes you feel welcome and taken care of 
very good standard accommodation - f&b too pricey for what it is 
i was offered complementary newspaper and there is free wifi in the room 
booked the hotel through last minute 
yet it is a pleasant 10 min walk to the south mall and is right over the road from the 
wonderful large bathrooms 
special pillows 
if you are looking for a quiet stay with nice amenities and a centralized location 
it was a reasonable value with a nice selection of items to choose from and a relatively reasonable price 
coffee or light snack was perfect and there is a reading room up higher although we didnt have time 
the location ensures that you can visit a lot of places in a simple short walk else public transport is 
the street is a little noisy but we could n't hear any noise from other rooms 
and the bar on the top floor is also worth a visit ( or two ) 
furnished classically with a particularly nice bathroom with white marble and a separate tub 
it was quite expensive but i believe sydney in general is very expensive and the location was 
close to good restaurant nearby and close to miraflores city center 
the service and the experience are worth it 
the room is amply sized and comfortable and the view wonderful 
close to the worlds best hotel shower 
the restaurants are also expensive and the food is of very poor quality 
the small pool area is adjacent sharing the terrific view 
who said that someone had put the wrong menu on display and the cost was u00a322 
standard quality of service and convenience with no complaints and a good breakfast 
on the 11th floor ( outdoors if you wish ) with the great view supporting really excellent food 
wifi is terrible and expensive and the phone system is terrible 
harbour bridge and the opera house 
highlighted the efforts the staff go to ensuring guests are treated exceptionally well 
the area around the hotel was safe and the park immediately in front of the hotel was good for a 
our room on the fifth floor was very clean 
but very good value for money 
would i stay again yes if i got the same rate . 
considering the frequent traffic snarls closer to the metro terminus - which is a short r 
but the room was gorgeous and the wait staff was excellent and everyone was extremely nice and helpful 
) room rather dull and single beds not great 
i am trying to lose some weight and i 'm keeping quantities down so i do n't want 
they looked after our bags while we did some more sightseeing and then picked them up later 
experienced 2 nights at the hotel on an upper floor with the most fantastic view of the pacific 
and a large bathroom 
leisure facilities are better than average and there 's a reasonable club lounge available for qualifying guests 
the tower hill tube station is a 5-8 minutes stroll away 
the first room we stayed in had a movable dividing wall with the room next door and at night 
the room was quiet with a good desk area and nice sitting area the front desk staff was friendly and 
i think it is the best hotel - it has a wonderful swimming pool 
on a positive note the location is very good and the breakfast was excellent 
we had to wait for the menus and then had to wait to order and then had to wait for 
large marble bathrooms 
they charge you 20 pounds per hour 
represents excellent value for money for london 
at the front desk reception 
the toilet had fully given up the ghost and the mainetnance man called down to organize a change 
more examples of personal touches 
clean property and polite & helpful staff 
and lovely spa were wonderful 
the restaurants are great 
pool and jacuzzi are great after a long walk in nyc 
room was of a nice size 
the resort is an easy 30 minute transfer from the airport ( rm230 for a standard four seasons car 
i was attending an event in battersea park and this hotel is almost opposite 
massive personal spaces to enjoy 
very pleasant with great staff 
we 've always liked staying at the hyatt regency over at exchange place 
with a large room with great facilities and very comfortable 
however we could hardly drag ourselves away from the pool areas and the kids were so happy in the 
one very attractive thing in that hotel is the adult swimming pool 
the beach is nice 
things did n't start well when one of the front desk clerks had a screaming fit at some poor 
lunch in the main restaurant was elegant and pleasant but nothing exceptional and pricey as to be expected 
the beach is perfect 
the outdoor shower gets a particular mention for its stunning vista 
as an spg gold member and entitled to a 4pm late checkout my request was n't noted 
hotel room was good - for relaxing - poor if you have work to do ( desk was inconvenient 
very small and poor quality 
no care and attention to making up a nice cocktail and it tasted like 
and hot items available to order 
i understand the hotel is on the ocean ( i was told to open the windows ) 
- hotel is clean and has good basic amenities 
this meant that we had to open to window to cool the room down 
i always get upgraded to their lifestyle suite which is absolutely beautiful 
- they say that the tap water has to be boiled but provide no free drinking water ( closest shop 
as was the complimentary shuttle bus we took one day as we were simply too lazy to walk 
the bathroom was very clean and staff we helpful at check in 
but it was a very nice pool area to be in 
this is a very nice property in an ok location in beverly hills 
virtual infinity bed which made you feel as if you were suspended over the cityscape 
the lobby although spacious is very dark and in fact much of the hotel is very dark inside 
walk out the front door jump on bus 109 , takes you to the train . 
if you have a small carry on suitcase that would be fine 
room size was pretty small 
the front desk was great 
but happened on two different nights 
our room was very cold 
great rooms 
room was spacious , neat and had a great view . 
overall the menu is varied and prices are average 
milk goes in and it 's just limp and pathetic and cool light coloured tea 
very good buffet clean rooms and extremely courteous and helpful staff 
conditioner etc so finding really nice toiletries is a huge bonus 
already stepping out of the taxi you get that very special feeling of welcome 
checkout was much more efficient than checkin ( different member of staff ) 
it is a long walk to the center of town 
are rather bare and very basic and i was pleased that we were only here for one night 
if you 're arriving by train you need to exit from the left side of the station in to 
this is a good upmarket chain hotel -- but i 'm not sure that it 's worth 
not keen on the interiors of the rooms - they are trying too hard - the air con only 
i enjoyed my stay at this hotel with nice rooms that were well appointed 
however there are many restaurants at nearby shopping area and the basement of train station 
the location is perfect and we had a wonderful time 
sleep quality - pretty good 
the bar was fun and the location is undergoing a lot of construction so i imagine it will only get 
the bed is fantastic and the lounge area extremely roomy 
nice city hotel 
very nice walk 
charges are exorbitant and the hotel does not provide sufficient shuttles at all 
a good gym 
ideally located near jonkey street and a new shopping mall 
luxurious and high quality 
room safes were removed for maintenance but kleenex and the ubiquitous tea pot and a large s 
nice cozy bar 
the reservation desk stated that you should never call the reservation line as they do promise a lot of things 
affordable prices 
one of the better options for a quick london trip 
on arrival the front desk told us they did not have king rooms 
i am not overly familiar with the boston area but i 'm sure there are better options 
good thing they decided the bathtub is a frill and did without it 
i let the front desk know 
and is worth staying at 
the pool area is crowded and there is just not a lot of space to lay down and relax 
we got a two nights for one deal and 
who took us on a roundabout drive to the airport and then charged us way more than a standard 
magnificent swimming pool 
the staff is very kind 
the hotel is new with bright 
breakfast at level 5 as average due to the crowd and food was not replenish fast enough 
the area around the hotel has an open feel 
do n't expect any service to take your baggage to your room 
overall a great stay but room for improvement 
rooms themselves were larger than average and light ( big plus point ) 
but not worth what it costs 
areas where tourist might like to spend time 
this is a huge hotel 
a walk away from centre of this small city and the trendier hotels there 
there were ongoing renovations 
as a kimpton member i get free internet -- definitely an incentive 
it 's also just a 15 minute walk to the port where there is a range of restaurants and 
the rooms are feasable spacious and quite even though it is located in the downtown area 
the etro toiletries were a nice touch 
fantastic new resort hotel 
the shower cubicle was large and in common with the rest of the room perfectly clean 
sleep quality was fine in the large double bed and the air conditioning was effective and quiet 
there 's a small lobby - it 's not fancy 
you 'd understand how to run a good airport hotel 
very up to date facilities and good service 
i communicated in advance with the reservation desk to book a car for the next morning for shuttle to k 
linens and towels all of good quality 
the voucher system for meals is archaic 
the service and amenities are first class with very well presented rooms with excellent checking in and concierge 
we chose the one on the top floor the first day we were there 
traffic crazy 
the service is also quite good 
great location but small poky rooms 
choose the front building 
really good gym in the basement 
showy boutiques if you fancy spending 2 
wonderful hotel staff with japanese hospitality 
the room is not very clean and does n't have an ac in addition the ventilation from windows could 
beats leaving central kl two hours early 
gives you courage for the next long flight 
the breakfast buffet was delicious and the staff was very friendly 
if you can get a good price 
00 pm the base made my bed vibrate 
try to avoid this hotel if you can 
but was offered a free upgrade upon checkin ( be sure to ask ) 
their popular rooftop bar that gets crazily crowded during the weekends ( and no 
overall a great base to explore this beautiful city 
there was always enough space in the breakfast room and the breakfast staff were friendly 
sama sama was so close to klia and her services were so friendly and neat 
but for any sort of tourism or urban experience 
the public areas are jumping 
as ihg gold ambassador members checkin was swift and efficient and we were allocated a spacious spot 
super comfortable mattress 
complete with teapot and cups and saucers 
huge bed was very comfortable to sleep in 
a great bed 
front desk staff charming 
you can easily walk to get almost all cuisines you could think of 
in the morning we were very impressed with the complimentary shuttle to klia2 
it makes up for it by offering all sort of complimentary drinks and snacks in the room 
good bed and decent shower 
frustratingly slow wifi 
in my last stay 
there is a small little gym on the first floor 
and the cold drinks in the fridge are free ( as are the snacks that most hotels put out to 
comes with a small kitchenette with stove and microwave oven 
double check which terminal you are coming into 
bed was very comfortable and a goods night sleep after a long flight 
this was ideal . 
hip hotel with excellent customer service 
fridge and hot water pot 
the hotel is well located just near elizabeth st and a short walk from major attractions like federation square 
what a great airport hotel 
breakfast a very basic continental job - no hot optionsoverall 
room was large and spacious and of course had the incredible four seasons bed which cannot be beat 
a 5-10 min walk will take you to bourke st mall 
nice bathroom with a big walk-in shower 
i do agree with other reviwers though in that my feet hung over the bottom of the bed 
the area is nice 
at least here the hotel looks decent on the inside and staff were friendly 
bath towel had a hole in it 
the postage stamp foyer has daily newspapers and the lifts require room cards to access the guest room floors 
after a few hiccups the manager olga sorted out the problems and we were upgraded and got 
in all restaurants same menu with few choices available 
leaving half of the table with food and the other half watching 
great staff and great accommodations 
which can transport you across the breadth of mannhatten 
the train station is only about a 7-8 minute walk away 
lovely hotel very dangerous area hotel web site this hotel i have stayed in before - and so on 
the bed is large and comfortable with nice pillows and easy access to controls 
all nearby hotels were very expensive during my stay 
it has a nice pool 
we had several mid-evening swims in the lovely inifinity pool and on the last 
colleagues complained about the dangerous lip stepping out of the shower and one colleague hurt his toe so 
i 'm such a fan of the holiday inn brand so staying here is always a pleasure 
the front desk staff 
clean rooms with a great blend of old charm & modern amenities 
nothing less than what you 'd expect lives up to the ritz carlton name in terms 
approach only the smiling lady at the front desk 
well worth a visit 
i stayed there for one night in conjunction with a meeting 
30am so great for early flights 
the restaurant staff was nice but the buffet breakfast was pretty sad for the 18 
stayed for 5 nights late january and was given a room on the 33 rd floor 
go to that building and look for the signs that says 'lifts' then take the liftt 
but there are several nice restaurants just outside the hotel 
it is considered one of the nicer hotels 
opt for the higher floor for the view 
inside the airport with a short walk to terminals and the train station just one level below 
bathroom vent disgusting with dust and coffee for 2 ppl with 2 milks and a coffee machine 
modern and perfectly located if you need to catch a flight next morning 
the breakfast area looked like it was designed in the 1970 's and has n't been touched since 
there may be some fine prints or statements printed on the invoice that you will never expected 
smelling really fresh and all the basic functions like lights 
i stayed in the hampton inn on pearl street after this one and it was cheaper and 1000x 
meals are more expensive at the resort than the dozens of local places but quality is good 
there is only one single bathroom on this level which also includes the hotel restaurant jams which has a somewhat 
everything for sale in the hotel 's pantry can be bought from the airport terminal supermarket for 1 
proslocated right on my the boardwalklocated on beachbreakfast area lovely on beachinf 
dinner was superb and enjoyed by all . 
beds big 
there are also some a few minutes out of town that looked much better value for money 
had dinner at the hotel coffee house and was content with the steak i had . 
n nwe 're accor loyalty club members and the upgrade provided to us was fabulous 
the bed is amazing 
nearby train station and some restaurants and super market 
the bar and restaurant are wonderful as well 
and i must say one of the best fresh fruit salad plates i have ever had 
the walk to the airport terminal and the city train station is longer than i thought it would be 
ticks the boxes for business now lets be real with each other , your not checking out this hotel 
our suite was beautifully appointed with luxurious furnishings- large comfy sofa and 2 club chairs placed in 
the facilities are good - sufficient outlets 
i decided to head to one of the cafe to enjoy some nice coffee and warm croissant before 
not as wide a choice as similar hotels in vietnam we stayed in 
it is a little pricey but the food and atmosphere is wonderful 
however there was only one bar soap for both the wash basin and the shower 
the hotel staff is very kind and helpful although you might face some communication problems 
ask for the upper floors - they should be quieter 
i think this hotel is a really good value for your buck 
when i was waiting to check-in i heard a couple complaining about the air conditioning not working 
if you just need somewher to sleep , shower and rest a bit this is the place to 
but the beach was among the cleanest i have visited in asia 
liked that it was close to the metro and various trams that could take you into the city 
and refreshing welcome drink 
modern hotel in prague 
the staff are absolutely outstanding in every department 
saw a colleague 's room which was completely different from ours but also in the suite category and enjoyed 
the fortress hotel is one of the best hotels in sri lanka 
the best part was whiling your time away ib front of the pool and watch the sea splashing 
jumeirah carton towers is close to hospitality perfection 
two good fresh pizzas 
it is also conveniently located near the airport and the old town 
i also found walking barefoot on the wooden floor made my feet turn black with dirt - better cleaning 
fancied a drink at 3pm and the bar was not open 
5 hours from colombo airport with the new highway ( and shorter time by end 2012 when the highway 
the price was extremely good value 
the hotel will charge you and not care about your satisfaction 
everything was very high standard and the buffet breakfast was fantastic 
the lobby very stark and because of the club when i returned from dinner the guys manning the door 
pricey & not very good wifi 
two double beds with pristinely white frette sheets and comfortable pillows 
all combined with a fair price 
there is major construction in progress on 3 sides of the property and a very noisy 6 lane road on 
i also like their pool and gym 
the decor is very tasteful 
though the lounge was very quiet and peaceful on christmas eve and christmas day 
but nice big airy reception 
there was also a large gym and pool available 
it 's well located and a very short drive from the old city 
the only drawbacks were the slow and tiny elevators and the even slower bell service 
staff very friendly and efficient and very close to southbank so great location 
room very comfortable with amble choice of english language tv channels ( which is not a given 
the standard of this hotel is very high and it is without any doubt one of the cleanest hotels 
worn-out bathroom with dirty shower curtain and head shower that 's nearly falling apart 
staff are all super good looking and friendly but they do n't make up for the over-designed 
great bath accessories 
there is also a nice pool even i could not use it because of heavy business program 
a very good business hotel 
with some odd noise 
the best part of miami ) offers the greatest pool an hotel can have 
they have a huge gym and equally large pool 
for me this is the best area of manhattan 
the lobby is beautiful and there are many pictures with stories about the presidents who stayed there 
the wifi was free 
the largest swimming pool ever 
we were quite shocked as we stood in front of the reception and were only with three persons so well 
nice having a separate shower and bath 
there is a great gym 
breakfast buffet was excellent and had an omelette station 
staff is friendly and the breakfast pretty nice 
bathroom was big with separate shower and toilet cubicles but with a bath in the middle of the 
the bar staff are great and will advise you if you need help 
it was a bit pricey but nice ambience and nice service 
the main lobby is trendy with desing furnitures and minimalist 
they have underground parking which is good because your car does n't get hot with the sun 
close to so many good restaurants like spice market and the standard grill it is close to cielo 
a convenient boutique hotel if visiting chelsea or the meatpacking district 
nice decor 
usual very high standards that you expect from the intercontinental with lovely pool and location on the beach 
there is a strip of restaurants opposite that had good dining options 
the restaurants served excellent food for breakfast and brunch where i can enjoy sweeping beach view 
a large jacuzzi and a swim up bar adds to the overall atmosphere 
and bar restaurant opening hours reflect this 
the beach in front of the resort is average 
rooms are spacious and nicely appointed 
and i was rather rudely informed by an african american male staff at reception that even though 
its conveniently located in sanlitans area and easy access from the airport 
the service is very good -- interacted with front-desk 
rooms a good size with spacious shower 
they only had one person working the front desk and several people in line 
we were place on the third floor 
i thought great value for the location and solid experience 
in the past the front desk staff was excellent 
wonderful swimming pool and comfortable environment 
the location is excellent with many subway stations nearby 
many eateries and theaters 
functional and good value 
location is clearly goo if you like times square 
staff was generally friendly although restaurant staff were inefficient 
stunning common areas and excellent amenities 
the club lounge made our stay special 
food spread was not great though 
very comfortable and good size 
the cavalieri remains one of the best-run grand european hotels with a style and commitment 
one of the top 5 hotels i 've stayed in ( and i 've stayed in a lot 
rooms are very spacious and with a balcony that can open up 
so many better options 
so you need public transportation to get around 
the setting and the food were fantastic 
very good service and serene atmosphere 
non alcoholic drinks 
the hk 60 is quite expensive when you can find as low as hk 4 at a local 
the upside of the scenic location is potentially beautiful views and calmness wonderful sleep quality 
wonderful location the location is everything , the rooms are ok but a bit small and the service 
within easy walking distance of the restaurants on the other side of the tiber and the city center 
it 's a decent hotel for a place to sleep 
dirty pool 
the mattress was very hardthe bathroom was so small that there was no room to put the bathmat 
it is the only place in town to stay 
the quiet pool is quiet there is no music 
good business hotel if you need the location 
i would return at the right price 
really comfy bed and bedding and bathroom were all good 
we took advantage of the free shuttle into sausalito 
is located in a quiet area away from the bustle that is rome 
the hotel is a large waldorf property 
we had free access to the pool and spa 
we cooked a fair bit in the fully functional kitchen 
food at restaurant was fine - however expensive and service not to standard expect 
food and beverage prices are indeed high 
one can build a hotel that is perfect 
nearby are several restaurants and pubs 
the lobby of the hotel is both breathtaking and imposing and it is great to see a hotel with a 
the bed and room were exceptionally comfortable 
even gave me free drink voucher as had to wait a few minutes due to others checking in 
we did the wine pairing and the price for the dinner was surprisingly reasonable at a venue like this 
it might well be the fact that paris hotels are different but we did not feel well-att 
the second floor room has a side view of the lock and it can be noisy if there are many 
their 3 star la pergola restaurant on top was an unbelievable experience 
come on holiday inn - even modest hotels have flat screens these days 
very elegant interior inside the room and within the hotel 
good free internet speed 
superbly comfortable and spacious rooms 
when on business in a foreign country it is always so good to be able to stay at a 
very good fitness centre and indoor pool area 
good spa 
ours ( 611 ) having a large bathroom 
the best about the novotel is central location and the 5 min walk to the tube 
although it might be the closest thing available in this area of iceland 
the restaurant on the ground floor was nice and the buffet breakfast was pretty damn good too 
had breakfast at the restaurant but unfortunately barista coffee is not available in the price 
service and breakfast was pretty good and design of room was n't bad 
n nperth is compact enough that any city hotel is going to be well located for most things 
roof top pool was good n wish i had time to try the restaurant as it look very popular 
near to several mtr stations and a longer 15-20 minute walk ( depending on how thick the 
post a short trip to macau 
we skipped the touristy blue lagoon and only bathed at the hotel pool 
the overall feel is an efficient business hotel 
- if staying more than one night let reception know your preferred time for room servicing 
on the weekends you will get an amazing price 
rooms are very trendy and comfortable with i pad stands and very large flat screen televisions being the 
breakfast buffet is large and varied 
modern hotel in commercial area walking distance to all you may need to do 
concierge was prepared and handed me a brolly - nice touch 
the rooms are quite small but really showing their age 
the food was excellent and i believe that the lunch time menu is quite reasonable where the evening meals are 
there are a number of restaurants on the property and they are offering hotel guests 15 discounts 
was convenient and easy to access from the hotel 
the eggs were really badly done and gluten free toast bread is not offered 
i think this hotel makes out to be more than it is 
we asked the front desk for information on the festival and their answer was that they did n't know 
then the disappointing thing was the noise that came in during the night forced me to close it again 
another great property of starwood worth the stay 
its an old building and the bathroom is tights 
i looked in the lobby and my luggage was unattended in the corner 
new ones on top floor are fab 
a nice touch and something unique was a complimentary smartphone which allows you to not only browse the internet but 
room choice is pretty important here as a low street facing room can be very noisy to late in the 
vibrant bar restaurant and happy staff 
there is so much better in nyc at the same price 
we used the complimentary shuttle exclusively to queenstown and found it more than adequate 
new modern apartments with paper thin walls 
the location is convenient for travelers 
it remains a comfortable 5 star property conveniently situated near to the business district and the convention center 
bed ok - pillows a bit lumpy 
a perfect place to stay 
but the rooms are still big 
the hotel it self made relatively new modern impression as known from the courtyard brand 
on the top floor ( the views from there are spectacular but only if eating as the bar area was 
washroom was clean and spacious 
the pool and gym was a long walk away and you have to past the barber 
well located this is one of bangkoks most established hotelsall facilities are to hand and the staff 
after day 3 i decided to do all my meals outside of hotelsorry guys 
the heart of santa monica ( for me ) is the collection of streets just back from the 
great service prior to stay and on arrival at hotel a very professional and friendly approach - room on top 
pool is nicer and less noisy from the traffic nearby 
quietness and privacy 
the bath is well equipped with a separate shower and bathtub 
location was superb and staff except the first girl at reception were very friendly 
the hotel is nice and modern with large rooms ( by london standards ) with a large modern bathroom 
the bed was very comfortable and lighting very good 
the hotel is in a safe area and there are a few nice restaurants close by 
easy to travel from as train next door - as is a supermarket if needed 
despite its unprepossessing location the hotel is surprisingly convenient for tourist spots like covent garden ( 
it was ok for the price 
the water pressure is too low which makes the shower rather unpleasant 
but - they are making up for it by its friendliness and general good service 
the 10 buffet breakfast was also very good value 
also the breakfast in the hotel restaurant is very poor - the selection of dishes is very limited and the 
the noise level is not too bad because of thick window and there are strict restriction on types of airplanes 
some would see location as far out but for us it was 10 mins on the dlr into central 
limited parking lots available 
comfortable bed and lovely breakfast 
i came from the dlr and found teh route quite difficult with a small suitcase - it is 
the bts sky train and the underground network have stops at the front gate 
dusit has been maintained well over the years and begins to play a classic character from no 
the hotel is near an exhibition centre but you can get to the financial district on the light rail system 
dusit thani is in a convenient location 
the staff are perfect 
very well taken care of and rooms are extremely comfortable 
one of the leads in the front desk 
beautiful breakfast room and nice buffet 
services is standard thai hospitality - which is very good 
either for a long morning walk 
we received excellent service from all the staff 
my bed was really comfortable and the internet was very speedy 
it would be the first choice on our next trip to bangkok 
i like to try independent boutique hotels now and then and this one did not disappoint 
it was also an ideal location right next to hyde park 
although the lobby and main restaurant are nice 
room is a bit small but it has all the amenities you can need 
otherwise there are better options 
large public areas and great location downtown location although not next to all the new shopping complexes 
the choice of restaurants is good 
great resort for young kids 
the decor is upscale and modern 
they have a nice business center with several pc 's near the restaurant with printers and a conference room 
great lobby bar great location 
an okay hotel 
overall a good hotel and i would stay again if i needed to 
the main desk is very helpful in terms of directions and recommendations 
the amenities provided were first class 
rooms are very nicely designed and furnished -- comfortable to sum it up 
the hotel is an ideal setting near the river avon and close to all amenities including the hop on 
the bathroom had a walk in shower but no bath 
and not much better on the higher floors 
restaurant staffs were nice and polite 
but the best is the lobby 
and great bar 
a suite king size bed ) room with crowded guests on the ground floor 
we ate in the bar one night 
shower was small and cramped 
the shower had amazing water pressure in both the rainfall head and the handheld 
great location ask for an executive room . 
and had wonderful cocktails 
oh well its a lessoned learned to pay more attention when checking out and there are many other hotels 
the bed is good quality and the linens are nice 
great historical hotel in west hollywood 
dirty area 
so make sure you ask for a room with a nice view and high floor as the street can be 
i told her about the alarm and she said it had disturbed guests and a guest was smoking in the 
three large drawers 
from checkin to checkout this is a really nice hotel 
facilities were also good 
try for a room on a higher floor for quiet 
a very good stay 
then choose a resort in patong or karon---if your looking for a romantic destination without the 
the second room had one double bed - whereas we had booked two singles 
quite public unless you close the curtains which then defeats the purpose of the over sized veranda 3 
pool villa is very nice 
the interior lobby is bright white and modern as are the rooms 
the bed felt decent quality 
the pool was clean ( cleaned every morning ) and the water temperature perfect 
the hotel is very lovely and has comfortable rooms and amenities similar to any western style hotel 
definitely best in town 
especially the indoor out door bathrooms and your own little lap pool 
excecutive lounge oklunch not available in the restaurant but only in the bar 
the front desk staff were superb and accommodated all our needs 
still offering free bottles of water ( but not sure it 's in every room since i 'm 
good meals 
definitely among some of the best value in singapore 
start off with the main entrance under construction leads to confusion with cab drivers in dropping you off and bell 
late check out and access to a 'club room' which was in fact a small room with some 
wheelchair friendly 
tried to go to the bar on the 2nd floor and it did n't look very comfortable 
only 3 counters open for check in at around 17 
i did n't get a chance to try it out but it seemed to be quite popular when i 
room on second floor 
it was a bit noisy . 
great value for money 
we spoke to jantima she went out of her way to help and vicky in the restaurant 
the club lounge is pathetically small and there was no where to sit for breakfast ( so do n 
from the front desk to concierge desk all the staffers were very helpful 
the staff were generally friendly and helpful 
in gym only sauna and if you want to use the steam room you have to pay for the 
a very good mattress in ( my number one requirement ) in a bright 
i checked in late so that was quick and front desk staff had a small computer problem but she kept 
seems to be mainly used by locals and attendees at the massive sporting event centre attached to the hotel 
extremely attractive pool area surrounded by mature plantings 
any worries for later about noise did not occur as we had a great nights sleep with absolutely no disturbances 
we booked a small double room at 178 . 
it was well appointed and the in room wifi worked fine 
bottled water ( everyday ) and a stocked up mini bar for the first day 
special dinners with fresh imported normandy oysters and seafood are a highlight 
not only was the room suffocatingly hot 
the resort is an hr drive from the airport so plan your commute accordingly 
the staff is first class 
rooms facing the street may be noisy 
so we ventured outside the resort which was lined by restaurants like pizza company 
old cheap brown furniture 
reception welcome was friendly but it got quite busy and the receptionist could have done with some help 
hannah from the reception helped mrs east find a great spa off site that was amazing value for 
the hotel public spaces and rooms are sparkling clean 
fresh orange juice and lavazza coffee gave us every day a good start 
so maybe i expected better quality 
high floor 
we enjoyed some delicious meals in the area 
is really great for those who wishes to explore tokyo easily from the main station 
rooms quite spacious but old and beds way too small 
room is large and well appointed and breakfast is acceptable 
location ca n't be faulted . 
the hotel 's bar was a friendly place with great staff and the entire hotel had fast wi- 
the pool has a great vibe 
would definitely consider going back to this hotel but will not pay extra for the plaza luxe with lounge 
new and old wings connected at a large lobby 
there are hotels closer to central london 
the main tower is nearest to main lobby 
there is walking paths that hug the river thames in both directions making it a pleasant walk down to 
a pretty large room for tokyo 
had a very good stay 
we were on 22nd floor and great room 
interior is very stylish and furniture is custom-designed and glamorous 
most hotels around the world have it in the rooms may be slow and you can upgrade but none at 
all in all a great stay 
this hotel provides view of the city the hollywood hills and the pool area at the same time 
good value for money - i can recommend it mainly due to location 
the location is central to all things l 
rooms are as well very different in size 
the hotel management run a club at the rooftop starting early evenings . 
the hotel is clean and has good amenities ( pool 
hopping a ferry to sausalito is a breeze 
i thought the bathroom was a bit underwhelming for the price that you paid 
shinjuku nightlife is a nice walk from the hotel 
the new lounge was just opened on december 2016 
very central but as i was on a lower floor facing a busy street so did get a bit of 
it is quite a large hotel with many speciality restaurants that mean not having to walk too far to 
separate shower and great cosmetic products 
exploring-and this property makes a great base to experience the best of san francisco 
working ( in the financial district ) 
the management said i could move but that check in is at 3pm 
the good thing about the hotel is there is english translations to go with what you are about to eat 
lots of eateries outside 
yes the decor is nice and the library bar and restaurants are lovely 
you will get the bridge and the square views while you are relaxing reading a book in your in room 
a tv in the bathroom was a real surprise . 
communal areas all have great views of the surrounding countryside and are both nicely furnished and well equipped and 
lovely hotel in an amazing location 
very busy front desk 
breakfast was good value and a great selection of quality food - cold buffet and hot table service in 
the manager left a nice greeting in our room 
it 's top floor but there 's no brilliant view 
there are so many better hotels and more centrally located 
which i only do if the facility is so outstanding that i want to share it with others 
in room wifi was fast and easy to connect to 
knowledgeable concierge and great breakfasts 
but has the facilities you 'd expect for the price 
thanks for the room upgrade - spacious luxury king with very comfortable beds and very clean 
bath amenities are better than average 
has several restaurants including a sushi place ( kamehachi ) 
if room size is an issue 
stayed on a high floor looking towards lake michigan 
love the location of this spg property as a lot of tourist spots are within walking distance and there 
meeting space quiet and functional 
local eateries are also nearby 
when i checked in i asked if any upgrades were available and without even pressing a key i was told 
stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for 3 nights in early april 2007 
the check in staff were friendly and efficient 
one more thing i loved was the business center where you can print your documents ( hop-on- 
it is a quick walk to st patricks 
great service 
i was on the 6th floor in a superior room and it certainly was that 
certainly one of the better hotels in this area once you go south from bristol 
breakfast next day was good quality and hot 
the rooms could have had better sound proofing ( banging doors in the corridor being the biggest complaint ) 
very cumbersome to get to using public transport and in the evenings it almost feels like you 're trapped 
peaceful breakaway hotel with good facilities 
which is indeed nice with superb bedding and sleep quality 
outstanding value for a high quality hotel 
smart move as the whole area was extremely busy as one would imagine 
found a free car parking space that was a bonus due to some building work round the rear of the 
wifi was available via a code at the front desk but details in-room were vague 
there is a gym and limited free internet 
the bar at the front of the hotel has a friendly buzz and the food is quite decent 
an unexpected treat was some live music in the garden area 
and the quality of the accomodation remarkable 
while mtr stations and the airport express station are not too far away 
green carpets and light colored furnishings that are chipped 
originally hubby was worried the ground floor room was too close to the street entrance & so a 
with a comfortable bed and nice bathroom 
black furniture & black carpet which made it really gloomy & not a room we wanted to linger in 
the front desk staff were very friendly and proficient 
and other unnecessary fluff that justifies other hotels exorbitant rates 
superb bathrooms 
nice lounge & kitchen area 
staff are terrific and this place is worth a visit 
the hotel offers free parking in front of the houses and free wireless internet as well 
i had booked a mini suite which was a bedroom with a separate sitting area which is kinda nice 
the property is spanking new and has a modern look 
with tour groups and large parties of indians celebrating weddings 
this is a nice hotel with really nice rooms 
although i do n't really have a specific complaint about this hotel 
i made the reservation on the phone and the procedure is smooth and quick with a very clear confirmation email 
excuse - festive rush and completely booked hotelyou arrive after dinner around 10pm and the 
extra towel and extra mug in the room 
very clean and wifi 
pool and fitness centre are excellent 
i am from chicago and used to seeing the spectacular skyline so the lack of view was not a 
the executive lounge is large but lacked atmosphere 
harrod 's and the fancy shops are right there 
the cafe bar is slow with serving you all the time 
typical poor quality london hotel 
the lobby was n't large and cavernous 
nice hotel to stay but not lob nger than 1 week 
the room was comfortable enough for my family of 3 
the rooms are a very nice standard and outfitted with all you need ( in fact 
a very comfortable overnight visit 
but overall it is a very good hotel 
the fish restaurant was excellent although the waiter forgot about our main courses that resulted in my wife 's 
heavy furniture and drapes in the rooms 
the bed itself was incredibly small for a double room 
first class spa 
so this is right in an area of good connection 
i particually enjoyed the public areas which reflect a palace 
reception staff were friendly 
a great lunch 
rooms are fair size and modern 
having said this the marble tiled bathroom is also spacious with good water pressure and a shower that is 
when i arrived they gave me they key for someone elses room 
after so many years living and working in china i kind of lost the believe in 5 star service 
unassuming hotel with great room and location 
but that includes a lovely pot of properly prepared tea and a large selection of small cake and sandwiches on 
we had an executive room which was extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean . 
well worth a visit 
west brompton station is about 5-minute walk from the hotel 
service at the reception was pretty efficient although we did have to pay up front rather than at the end 
valet parking is available but prices are pretty expensive as expected in the city central 
the hotel rooms are nice and the bathrooms modern 
a wedding night working in the industry sometime has some benefit so i called and arrange with the hotel for 
great building and nice staff but 
lodhi team your are simply amazing and if we return to delhi you will be where we 
beyond the inflated pricing due to the holiday season 
a nice touch was the iron and table 
you have the option to agree to accept an upgrade if available 
the heardryer was a high quality hair dryer ( much better than those found in most other 
it is the front of house team that really need a lift - it is not alright to sigh or 
very limited opportunity for suite upgrade - understandable 
the bed was comfortable and the wifi free 
navigator gave me the directions and hints which made transport easy 
free wifi which is a major plus in australia where it is normally eye wateringly expensive 
there is a roof top bar with an outside terrace which makes a good stop for a drink and 
overall it 's a decent hotel for business stay 
we had the bathtub overlooking the city and direct views to the bosphorus and the bridge 
the staff were wonderfully helpful and courteous and the view was divine 
be nice to the receptionist and you may be upgraded 
crowded city of dhaka ( with right mindset 
reception and concierge very attentive and helpful 
the hotels are comfortable with great views of toronto 
ca n't believe that in this day and age that you pay huge money for a night or two 
but overall the location was not that bad 
the beds were excellent 
we found the hotel to be exactly as we would expect for a high quality london hotel 
the westin is like a an oasis of civilisation in an otherwise crowded and busy city 
rather noisy ( facing airco and ventilation system of several buildings in the inner yard ) 
and being on a high floor insulates you from the noise of dhaka 
it was in fact just a standard room in my eyes 
it is in a great location in the financial district walking distance to king st west and queen st west 
what i liked most was the room service which you ca n't get after 11pm at night being 
i was unhappy the lounge was open only for breakfast 
what does not allow me to give 5 stars to this property is exorbitant prices for room service 
it took up too much space and if two of you were sitting on the bed you could not face 
stayed for 4 nights mid week in early june 
i 've never experienced that in a major metropolitan hotel before 
but perfectly adequate and the bed was very comfortable 
the rooms are fair sized and outfit well for business with a great desk with electrical outlets built in -- 
the welcome from the doormen was okay if a little laissez-faire and the 
the executive lounge offered a great view 
minibar and the bathroom 
hard to imagine any person getting a good nights sleep 
there is a grocery store next door and very close to the park 
they wanted to charge one complete night only for late check out 
my room was clean 
what a lousy hotel 
easy check in and out . 
typical courtyard but the lounge area was busier than ones i 've stayed at previously 
but it has a small bistro open for breakfast and dinner 
clean bathrooms 
the pool area is average and the internet photo of the pool is a bit deceiving - the pool 
quiet and the bed was comfortable 
very close to airport 
a number of rooms have weak air-conditioners that have trouble keeping the temperature down on hot days 
the decor is exactly as shown on the ( -- ) website which we booked through at a rate of 
bed was very comfortable . 
this neighborhood is an unfortunate trip back in time 
check in was easy assisted by pleasant staff 
( 10 mins walk ) just opposite the hotel is a convino shop ( 7 eleven ) for all 
i have to say the team really tried to accommodate everything they can do 
the bathroom is huge 
giving the hotel a very desolated feel 
we requested an extra pillow from the front desk 
with also a great outdoor terrace and great views to the dessert 
but this was readily corrected with a free upgrade 
fast free wifi too 
hotel is good 
with high ceilings and fine murals on the walls 
as others have said - the long review two or three below this being spot on - this is a 
infinity pool is quite nice 
our room was very spacious with big living room and work space 
cheap and great food with excellent service 
no free soft drinks from the mini bar 
the breakfast is pedestrian and the service perfunctory 
no apologies from the front desk or any letter of apology from the managment regarding this blackout 
a small infinity pool 
pool is small as it is a city hotel 
the facilities were excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful and charming 
still fairly easy access to the hot spots 
this is a very busy hotel catering mainly for mainlanders 
family sized rooms are very old and their management are claiming that they are undergoing refurbishments 
lots of green spaces around the hotel 
slightly disappointed that they only had olives as a complimentary snack 
the hotel is located a short distance from the main train station and near the edge of the old town 
nearby the hotel are various small restaurants providing local dimsum 
it was a pleasant hotel with a great location for exploring prague 
i am aware that if you book a hotel in a touristic area you may get a bit less 
recommend this hotel especially for families 
the breakfast buffet is also of high quality with something for everyone 
amidst the busy city sounds 
rooms very clean and well maintained 
as the very high service standards among all its staff more than made up for them 
the rooms are large 
it 's about 10 min walk away . 
the air con is a bit old and makes loud noises 
not a huge or resort type pool 
drink prices were reasonable for a london hotel ( 3 beer 
you have to request it from the front desk 
we stayed three nights in early january 
the building itself is beautiful and colonial in style and the pool area is a well maintained and a relaxing 
this hotel is a faded gem from yesteryear 
the wi-fi is only in the lobby and you have to buy cards to make it work at 
the lobby area was crowded and lobby restrooms were located on the mezzanine level 
with clean linens and towels and comfy bed 
the premier inn london blackfriars is a good option in london if you are looking 
the bed sheets smell terribly moldy and the hairs we found on it were not quite reassuring us of 
typical continental style breakfast 
both in choice and in quality- the bathroom design is poor 
but checked with reception and they assured me that the guests were checking out that morning so did n't 
clean and very spacious 
looked like a nice pool as well although we did not use that 
cheap restaurants around -- check out sagar for vegetarian south indian cuisine across the road from the 
the bathroom spacious and clean and the location to the airport once again was excellent 
upper floor one bedroom apartments are quite spacious and offer great lake views 
avoid the north side of the hotel a busy road runs alongside 
the midnight menu is limited 
pan asia is by far the best asian restaurant in the city 
2 kids pool and one more large common pool 
we went for a walk outside the hotel and there is not a great deal to see but there were 
there are so many wide open spaces and grandness to the hotel and its furnishings that 
if not then with thick plush carpetsthis is probably the most grandiose hotel that i have 
sleep quality that you get is good 
so i suppose i ca n't complain - just wish the price had matched the quality of the hotel 
swimming pools are good 
the prices are better compare to the ones at skycity 
it had a big bed 
the pool area is tropical and with a choice of 5 outdoor pool areas 
which i found slow and buggy 
the nearest mtr station - olympic 
western cuisine 
great bathroom with marble and great walk-in shower 
no wine for us then ! 
especially if you have looked at a picture of the discreet entrance pre-arrival 
while the massive size 
booking a room online on the hotels website entitles you to an upgrade to a higher category on 
trendy modern hotel 
the first floor had a very comfortable layout 
there are small motion sensor lights that light your way to the toilet in case you have to visit in 
really superb customer service 
coffee and fresh orange juice 
overall i will return to this resort again for its very child friendly facilities and great compound 
with very efficient elevators 
as an ihg property you would only expect this to be the case 
and we were greeted immediately by the front desk 
plus next door to the gym in the basement there is a laundry room where you can do your own 
was across the hall from the laundry so you could keep fit while you waited 
breakfast was buffet with good choice 
i spent most of my time in phuket in patong ( unfortunately ) and stayed one night 
the pastry was delicious and the service was outstanding 
it 's located in the city centre and has very limited underground car parking that operates on a first 
when we got tired of the pool 
all the room amenities are first class and bed and pillows as we like them 
incredibly cool bartender took such good care of me 
the public areas are extremely attractive 
nice chic rooms & i particularly loved their bathroom though sliding door was n't working smoothly 
as an elite member you get discounts on massage and the spa as well 
facilities and amenities are top-notch - plenty of space for kids to run around 
a wide open and spacious suite with all the comforts you could every wish for 
food and ambiance at the club lounge and restaurant were of good quality 
fri & sat have different time table sets 
the front desk staff were all excellent 
a nice lounge open to all guests that substitutes for the lack of a real lobby 
we had organized a late checkout when we checked in 
the hotel is a pretty standard marriott 
come early for breakfast 
the bath room was very good too 
there is a 2nd floor that has a light breakfast then cheese and crackers and wine at night 
i very much liked the shower but did not have hot water every morning 
we had requested extra pillows and they had been placed on the bed prior to arrival 
and the price was reasonable 
this is a solid hyatt property that exemplifies what hyatt does really well 
metro - while judiciary sq is closer ( either left from the entrance to left on e st and 
will definitely stay here longer in our next seattle run 
the room was fine ( see pictures ) and was adequate 
there is nothing luxurious abt the hotel or rooms but they are fine 
the gym was good and clean 
the hotel rooms are well appointed and the bathroom is very spacious with nice bath products 
there is no safe and no minibar 
great facilities 
they refused and the main reason is that the booking is at a special price 
lobby smells like an old vegas casino 
and no magnifying mirror ( even very basic hotels have these these days 
but getting to the city center was easy and quick 
the hotel arranged for a taxi to get us back to the train station the next morning and we slept 
for a quality otel like this it is a small investment to replace it with a contactless reader 
convenient indoor access to massive shopping complex is a real plus 
the bedding was luxurious and extremely comfortable 
comfortable bed and the junior suite also had a sitting area 
this hotel is closer to the airport than most of the other hotels in doha so if you need 
) but of course it was a good addition - no taxi is available in front of the hotel 
and right next to a subway station - easy access to all parts of taipei 
the front desk staff are particularly welcoming and helpful 
free open bar ( although we did not drink one single thing ) 5 
stylish and comfortable failing to find a good connection for my qatar flights , i decided to make 
it has the elegance and customer service you should expect from sheraton 
the buffet spread is also awesome 
we witnessed someone else sending their cooked breakfast back because it was cold 
with nice bathrooms 
the bed is quite firm so be warned if you prefer really soft beds but i liked it 
nice room and good breakfast ( although crowded ) 
we had a good room with the usual bathroom and room accoutrements we expect from soho 
this hotel is designed to accommodate large group of people or business traveller from the large ( sometimes noisy ) 
i had a renovated room with nice large bathroom with separate shower and the bed was huge ( and comfortable 
an enormous bed with lots of pillows and a large screen tv with lounge chairs 
our room was tastefully decorated and pretty good size from london standard 
they brag about having very fast wifi but i only clocked 6-8 mbps download speeds 
welcoming and lovely front desk staff 
i called customer service and then went out for dinner and when we came back the room was nice and 
being that it 's an old building that was renovated to be a hotel 
also the club lounge offering is one of the best in taipei 
room was very clean and bathroom as well even if small 
best club lounge breakfast 
floor lower down have less noise from rooftop bar although sacrifice the views 
bed was comfortable and had 4 large size pillows and a soft duvet 
hotel is located next to metro station which makes it very convenient to travel around the city 
the gym and swimming pool were great with extra really ins for the ladies 
this is a solid business hotel with good service 
great location and interesting historical hotel 
cat on the front desk 
we used the concierge service and the lady in the counter ( katie ) made her 
but the little touches- the new yorker wallpaper 
there is also a small room on the 2nd floor with few treadmills if you ca n 
i have always found the service on the club floors excellent 
can be a little pricey so check out the special deals before booking 
i would evaluate the price you pay and the hotel itself against other four star hotels 
nor did the hotel have a room service offering 
stayed here for two nights in an executive double with harbour view 
and cuba street less than 5 mins on your right 
best suite ( on 15 f ) we have stayed in 
the bar staff was very helpful and solved the hot water request perfectly 
so i had to find a nearby gym to do my workouts 
free wifi and hot showers 
should you wish to take a tuk tuk to the old city we were charged 80bht 
really nice patio area outside to eat breakfast by the pool in the morning 
the bed a little hard but a request at reception soon solved that 
oppressively tiny bedroom and bathroom 
the shower stall had a regular shower head as well as rainforest outlet 
not very deep but a perfect temperature 
- noisy children in the pool area ( not the hotels fault ) - a lot of flies at breakfast 
night clubs and restaurants-room is pretty ok and in good condition-good service at front deskthe 
we took the airport express to the kowloon station where we then took the k5 free shuttle 
great value 
nice & comfort room metropark club floor offer nice and convenience accommodation and and room facilities . 
location is ideal not only for business but experiencing the city old & new 
all tastefully decorated 
stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in a twin room 
the buffet lunch mediocre 
menu items are expensive and wine prices are ridiculously high 
but a lot of great amenities 
only big concern is next door guest climbing in to our balcony or room as climbing over between each room 
the airport bus stopped right in front of the hotel and made it so convenient to go to and from 
very luxurious rooms 
good value 
the location is good for business meetings in the city centre and there is a substantial shopping mall beneath the 
there are 4 hotels next to each other on the 39th 
soft towels and a lovely large bed 
airport bus stops right in front of the hotelnegatives - far away from the city center 
getting checked-in and onwards to your room takes about as much time to hail a cab in 
choose the upper floors ( club floors ) they are much better 
used a very reasonable park-n-fly rate to stay for one night 
the bathroom had a soaking tub and shower complete with hand held nozzle and rain head 
average - not more . 
one thing we really did n't like was the bathroom door - which was a large sliding door that 
usual fare at breakfast and the chef was pleasant and happy to make your omelette etc 
the rooms is amazing but not facing to the river ( should request next time ) 
if this is indicative of the standard and quality of other properties in the chain 
try an accessible room if you are having trouble with room odors 
it 's located on a quiet street just east of vauxhall pleasure gardens and about 5 minutes 
there is some sort of mall attached to the hotel but did n't seem busy ( downscale ) 
bagels available and a great touch 
she immediately upgraded both of our rooms to executive floors as honors gold diamond 
modern building 
the service was very nice and the dining room cheerful and beautifully eclectic 
the sauna an pool was crowded even on weekdays because they have classes held there 
the whole staff is speaking good english 
the facilities are first class with a master bedroom that overlooks the pacific and the swimming pools 
and the lack of a good fitness center was a bummer 
excessive upgade charges 
mindy you i had booked our stay only in november 2011 and i suspect that all of 
even suites only have 1 actual bed 
there are also great swimming pools to keep everyone entertained 
we did like the provision of a quiet area swimming pool which was perfect 
not so good is the small pool 
visit love this complexfood at its restaurants is over top and no need to go elsewherestaff very 
free internet but it was down for a whole morning 
the lounge was large and had excellent offerings and service 
with a huge lobby that in the evening includes a string quartet 
we stayed here for 5 nights and had a wonderful time 
if you spend the entire night calling front desk to get heating running 
frankly i think charging for internet in this day and age is disgraceful and if the e 
room service fast and efficient 
good size 
the bath products were a nice touch - especially liked the peach conditioner 
a personal butler ( which is a novel concept but we found a little weird and unnecessary ) 
it 's hypocritical to claim you are protecting the environment when you serving shark 's fin . 
a huge hotel 
there are a also number of excellent bars and restaurants within walking distance 
so you can only come in bed since the side free 
breakfast was good although there was less options for veg lovers 
breakfast is good spread but no extensive 
two big floor-to-ceiling windows over look the bund and the river 
i definitely will be back once i made my next trip to jakarta 
the bathroom was excellent 
the room is so clean and functionable 
one of the closest and best restaurants in shanghai called lost forrest ( yunnan style 
but you get quite a view when you are in one of the upper floors 
tv had a decent selection of stations and the stereo ipod player was nice 
on the 62nd floor you think that there 's nobody around who can see you 
when i checked in i realized i forgot all my toiletries and the staff brought me up everything i 
we met maria the pr manager on our first night and she kindly informed us of the free alcoholic 
very close to union station where we were able to get the subway and also travel back to pearson 
pleasantly decorated 
this is a large hotel attached to the convention center which makes if very convenient if you are attending a 
the bed and pillows were comfortable 
breakfast is very weak as the options are very limited and if yo are vegetarian you can just about 
acceptable wireless internet etc 
we checked out the rooftop and the gym though we did not take advantage of them 
a good business hotel 
found very difficult to find decent hotel from internet 
the hotel gives guests a very quiet place to rest after a long tiring day out 
maybe head for the higher up floors 
location was also near major attractions via the tube ( natural history museum 
prices in cafe dongtxi were very reasonable as we had dinner in there one evening 
not centrally located but accessible by taxi and tube 
only negative is a long elevator wait at busy times and recall same from last visit 
but then have to go up to level 3 for the reception which was fine when we got there because 
situated right by a busy road 
this is a great hotel 
the airport express bus stops right in front of the hotel 
the bathroom was very clean and well appointed 
a complementary upgrade ( thank you front desk staff ) was very large 
there was a large gap under the mirror between the sink allowing a tossed item ( box of 
all rooms are extremely clean and tidy 
les suites has a great location on the bund and the shanghai deluxe rooms have a spectacular 
standard rooms not very large 
the hotel is located in tokyo midtown 
tokyo is an amazing property 
i have stayed several times at the rembrandt over the years and this i would have to say 
but as i said overall good value and i would stay here again 
the bathroom was so large it almost seemed silly 
this is a very good hotel and especially the views from the room and the lobby bar area are impressive 
and very nice bathroom 
the room was small and the facilities were average and in need of refurbishment 
overall i would choose another hotel next visit to the area 
there are also different levels of dining casual 
then you take the elevator up to the first floor 
cheaper parking is available around the area but i preferred to avail the convenience of letting the hotel care 
their customer service is excellent and you absolutely cannot beat the location 
the marriot times square conceirge lounge is massive but the food offerings are very bland 
the staff was rude 
hotel common areas were modern and clean 
the room was small but functional and that is fine although the mattress was as hard as a board 
the area is very convenient for shopping and there are several metros in close proximity 
one of the nicest hotels in nyc for its price range 
good shopping and eating too are close at hand ( the pizza and hot chocolate from the place next door 
especially when compared to the spacious club lounge at the ritz carlton hong kong 
a huge starbucks for your morning coffee and a couple of metros close by 
we had found its price quality ratio very high 
so easily accessible to anywhere you need to go in new york 
plenty more storage space and huge full bathroom with spa inspired shower 
the staff were fantastic - they could n't do enough to help and were so friendly 
perhaps due to the age of the building and the rather flimsy window frames 
there is no better place to stay in rome 
bed is very comfortable and large bathroom 
the hotel is quite grand and has a lot of extra 
the fresh orange juice in the lounge is the best i 've had in 2 weeks 
very old original property 
reviewer who found the furnishings less than superb 
the staff were really helpful and professional 
a very special and inspiring interior with old recordplayers 
no cooling aircon 
a proper gym - complete with olympic bars 
i received a complimentary upgrade to the gold floor 
great location if working in east london city with loads of restaurants and bars nearby 
not sure why it has four stars as facilities are no better than a travelodge or premier inn 
disgusting old elevators can see out what is left of a once useful life 
or else its a long walk 
loads of great bars and cool places to hangs out 
its undergone a renovation and the room was new 
spacious and renovated and the bathroom was clean and updated 
london is a huge city with major crows verywhere you go 
on check in staff couldnt find my room but was sorted within 5 minutes 
modern rooms is a gorgeous old building 
the staff at the hotel were fantastic and helpful and it was a real pleasure staying at this hotel which 
the quintessential little moorish palace 
sorry to hear that . 
stayed here for 3 nights in mid april as i was running the london marathon 
yes it used to be a palacesuperb serviceits just grand and majestic when you enter the 
the staff at reception were excellent and very welcoming- couldnt do enough for us 
very cost effectively as well 
a nice touch 
the hotel desperately needs a referb and a redesign 
able to walk every where 
spacious room with a fridge and microwave in tribeca 
the club room has small balconies that look out toward park city and the mountains and the view is 
the staff is just fantastic 
you could walk down to main street and enjoy some nightlife 
there 's a starbucks at the lobby and restaurants are 2 blocks away ( but really big blocks 
what 's not to recommend - perfect business hotel 
very nice touch 
it has standard 5 stars facilities 
do not forget to enjoy superb cantonese food in the seventh son restaurant , which is not 
the food options modest 
look forward for my next trip to shenzhen 
particularly from the top floors 
london hotels are expensive 
good free tv channels included sky sports 1 2 3 on large flat screen tv 
bit less than average 
public areas and rooms are well maintained 
we got an early checkin too which was an added bonus and just 5 min walk from bond street 
the last time i was in cardiff i stayed at the hilton which is pretty much on par 
very clean and fresh and was good value for the price 
nice restaurant . 
business rooms good 
indoor and outdoor heated swimming pools and fitness centre for the comfort and rejuvenation of the guests 
overall this property was great for a one night stop with family 
comfortable room and helpful staff 
yes location wise you could n't ask for something better and all staff were quite friendly but i still 
wonderful artisan breads 
ask for a high floor so you can see the delhi skyline over the canopy of trees 
overall though the oberoi has an excellent gym and better pool facilities and breakfast spread than both 
parking is good but can be full 
however although i have always found berlin a friendly city 
especially we enjoyed the broad selection of their breakfast ( european , indian , asian 
when booking a hotel with the marriott name i expect a little more . 
the small exercise floor could n't be used because a trainer was there working with a couple of women 
very nice spa 
we arrived early from a red eye flight from la and the room was not yet available 
did not use the microwave or the fridge , but can imagine it could be useful . 
the rooms are dated and not extremely well maintained 
the bathroom was also clean and tidy 
had a large walk in shower 
not enough front desk staff especially during peak check-in times 
computers and printers are available in the hotel 
there was good lighting service was excellent throughout the hotel 
30am to a speedy checkin and our room available at 7 
rooms are comfortable and airy and staff generally friendly 
v good location for business 
public areas are expansive and impressive 
i can say that it is not a brand new hotel but it is perfectly maintained and the spa and 
want to be treated like royalty 
the bathroom had nice amenities and had everything you need 
good pool 
a beautiful and modern lobby with a choice of several dining options 
location is fantastic and the make over is high quality but understated 
there have to be better options 
princess is very well located in the new area of barcelona with easy access to the beautiful 
the beach is also close 
a lovely bathroom with shower area and a decent sized bathtub 
i have stayed in some hotels where do n't open till that time 
decent food and great bar 
pillows were the worst i have seen in awhile and the comforter for a king bed was 
vanessa the concierge is super efficient and extremely helpful to organize things 
prompt and friendly service - in the dining area 
i went down to tell the other front desk guy 
the front desk staff again was very cold about it 
the bathroom was nearly as big as the bedroom with a nice shower and strong water pressure 
my only complaint would be that my room had a super noisy a c 
the resort is very definition of customer service 
after having a massage it is nice if one can relax for about 10-15 minutes 
super fab toiletries and so many towels 
all guests have individually commented on the event and this has certainly left a lasting impression for all 
this cafe is a perfect place to just sit back chill and perhaps read write a book or so 
large rooms lobby smell like the bulgari perfume 
the staff at the airport welcomed us 
called the reception from my cell phone , but no reply , went to voice mail . 
the resort is beautiful and the room including a large balcony was just a dream come true 
our room was clean and comfortable 
this is by far one of the best resorts and ics i have ever stayed at 
since the resort had been open only two months at the time of our visit it is understandable it was 
this boutique hotel is perfectly located in knightsbridge ( just a block away from harvey nichols 
also the location is just perfect 
i cannot emphasize how incredibly beautiful this resort is 
would suggest to give danang sun peninsula resort a one try 
well worth a visit - stay a week if you can - you wo n't regret it 
the hotel is only 5 minutes away from the airport and has a free shuttle service that runs every ten 
we arrived 10 minutes before check in time and the receptionist was less than friendly or accommodating 
you wo n't be tripping over each other or your luggage and personal items 
the staff were really friendly and the room was fantastic 
award winning hunter 486 with its secluded booths and open fire kitchen set up is equally great 
very pleasant stay 
the pool noise and the staff 
get the rooms closer to the main lobby 
with minor maintenance needed for the curtain 
with its own private beach 
free soft drinks and bottled water in mini bar 
the hotel will charge any extra service 
very helpful staff 
the bathroom is actually generously sized and similarly luxurious 
and the hotel staff is very poor when talking english as only a few people speak it well 
3 and 4after complaining to the front desk 
- the high table that the bath amenities are located can be quite shaky - be careful not to tip 
the room was modest in size and the bathroom was a good size 
top floor can overlook mountain , downtown and ocean in a breathtaking panoramic view . 
clean and well located close to he centre of bath and the free parking is a real benefit 
the adult only pool was appreciated 
the bar is really nice but quite expensive for drinks 
perfect location - close to malls 
i walked down the street to a diner for a burger instead 
completely private beach 
the last couple visits i 've noticed ripped window shades 
separate shower and complimentary molton brown toiletries 
clean and tidy lobby of reasonable size 
it is a very basic hotel provided by free by emirates when you have more then an 8 
and i can certainly sympathize with the previous reviewer who was bumped off her flight to singapore and 
-the lobby is incredibly small and is not a place to hangout or wait for someone 
it does offer pretty good value - clean accommodation with modern comfort and friendly hospitality 
the room was decent with carpeted floor and small window 
when you check in you realise that most people at the hotel are in the same situation 
i asked the front desk for directions and they gave completely different directions so i was lost on both occasions 
getting around the city by bus from taichung station was very easy 
the bed was very comfortable and the a c was cold and constant 
super location - very good apartments 
microwave full kitchen really 
so i will just mention the good points are the pool which apparently is the biggest in sarawak 
however the outdoor swings were average and you have so much open land to really build a kids maze 
located in a very quiet area of town 
was safe and had plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance 
the rooms are tiny but that 's what you expect in nycthe price is competitive and 
the food options are good and staff helpful and attentive without being over the top 
in fact the area is very vibrant and there are lots of bars within staggering distance 
i asked at the front desk if i could buy water and was directed to the local store down the 
the city centre is a short drive away and the botanic gardens are easily accessed by foot - one 
we were overwhelmed with the choices of hotels available 
and a very nice bathroom 
that 's her name ) i 'll definitely stay at the fairmont given the opportunity 
no gym but you have free access to a local gymgreat value for money 
breakfast too was well organised and area was spotless - breakfast was full english and or continental ( 
maintenance came in quickly and resolved the issue . 
the front desk staff are very nice 
only wish is that gym was open later than 10pm ( it does reopen at 5am though ) 
this hotel is setting the bar high in terms of everything for manila 
we used the long bar in the next hotel as well as the buffet restaurant and both were excellent 
this is a 3 star hotel by international standard with uplifted decors for the corridor and facade 
the hotel cars are expensive to the point of ridiculousness ( 2 
the rooms at the hotel are good and the facilities to a very high order but it is the location 
the hotel is well located 
good bathroom 
we stayed in the club floor and the lounge was very large and comfortable 
one city view and one completely construction site view ( meaning no view at all ) 
my first trip to greece was enhanced by a 3 night stay at this beautiful hotel 
rustic hotel in the centre of the cities key shopping 
also the welcome amenity ( some liquor and chocolates ) was nice 
wifi is a problem 
the snacks were great 
the rooms are new 
the swimming pool area is a bit small now as it is shared with the apart- hotel ( r 
service was exemplary and decor classical 
i loved the quality of the hotel and room 
which is located on the first floor 
close to a lot of the major attractions 
there is a nice outdoor seating area by the bar but they ought to have a few mosquito coils there 
the hotel is well situated next to 5 of the biggest shopping centres and so it 's also has 
excellent quality 
but it 's a good size room for new york that allows you to open your suitcases 
the building is modern and everything functions as you 'd expectservice was super efficient 
the room was cozy and having a kitchenette allowed us to put together our own breakfast and keep our 
the location is good and there is a convenience store and bottle shop a couple of shops down for supplies 
not much benefits unless you are royal ambassador ( spire means nothing much except more points ) in my 
the supposedly rustic look of the lobby didnt give one a good feel on the cleanliness of the 
the room is clean and has all amenities including a microwave and little kitchenette with a fridgefreezer 
taxi from the hotel to the international airport cost us nzd 55 
ok inner city hotel 
club lounge access is a must 
they looked to be newly refurbished 
this is probably by far the best shower ive had in all my hotel stays 
i would stay here anytime it is priced right ( not often ) 
the bathroom was also small but the shower was large and the towels and everything was fine 
and as a person that have about 80 nights at hotels a year and also have worked in the industry 
the bed was quite large and comfortable 
the staff were very helpful 
landmark crowne plaza is nice hotel but old 
also easy access to hyde park for a bit of walk 
the lobby is rather small and having an army of people standing around does n't make the place feel 
i stayed on a club floor and the room was sensational 
even the lifts are small and the hallways narrow 
good choice of international menu with vegetarian options as welllocated conveniently in the louhu commercial district 
had an issue with my wireless and called the front desk 
the free wifi worked ok and there was a safe 
was lucky to be assigned the newly refurbished room 
i have enough space 
lobby bar is serving great drinks 
the room services has a limited choices and they charge an extra 5 pounds on the tray 
my room is located on the 12th floor - while it is called a suite with full open space 
i was surprised that the breakfast buffet did not offer any cooked to order eggs or omelettes 
though rushed ( i had an early flight to catch ) 
appetizers and main course as well as desert were delicious and the restaurant comes highly recomend 
perfect for business or tourists - large lobby for hanging out 
did n't like that smoking was allowed in restaurants and the lobby but that 's serbia rather 
it was superbly equipped and housekeeping was top notch 
good drinks 
amazing amenities including the spa 
except for an unfortunate experience with their victoria bar where we walked out due to poor service 
food and service are impeccable 
the lobby is impressive and the staff very attentive and service-oriented 
we got an early checkin and late checkout 
room was spacious and clean with good amenities 
wow -- amazing hotel 
over the road from the royal palace and old town with shopping within a couple of minutes walk 
the evening canapes change daily so it was interesting to see what would be on offer each evening 
clean and modern bedroom and bathroom 
as the building is one of the sights of stockholm itself 
the old town ( gamla stan ) is a short walk and also enjoyed moderna museet 
we found it difficult to get to the car park but phoned reception and they guided us in 
it has been a pleasant stay 
restaurants and easy access to the airport bus stop 
it is just expensive overall 
the gym and spa were very good compared to many hotel gyms 
great restaurants 
the rendezvous grand in melbourne is a beautiful old building that has so much character 
get the high floors 
the ceiling was black from the air conditioning and the bathroom was old and worn 
but the noise and trembling from tram and train especially at night was quite disturbing - not hotel 's 
rooms are good and spacious as we took business rooms restaurants are also good and pleasing 
a good location for food down the street but mostly korean bbq though the american restaurant 
the front desk seems to have difficulties in recognizing club carlson loyalty cards and the privileges the cards 
5 mn from a metro station and close to scores of restaurants and shops 
victoria style lobby - small modern room 
well managed hotel - great gym and wonderful breakfast 
friendly barman 
a walk down the hill to the left of the hotel takes you to the stations 
the wifi in the hotel is free as i am a silver member 
my 10th floor room was quiet all the time i was there 
i made this booking for easter weekend in hopes that renovations will be completed by mid-april 
a short walk to plaza lo yat ( computer gear heaven ) bb plaza 
though slightly dated furnishings 
it was not clear where reception was either 
a bit disappointed with the hotel 
we had a nice lunch at the deli and we also loved the welcome drink at the bar with 
the location is great 
i would recommend this hotel only if somebody have to stay in that area while no other hotels are available 
the connected lounge is a happening place with a united nations-like array of foreigners sitting around 
definitely not comfortable heavenly bed 
the breakfast buffet was excellent 
a wonderful deal and superb value for money 
warm-coloured nice nn chain hotel 
the bathroom is huge with 2 sinks 
with advice on nearby restaurants 
breakfast is super nice - and great juice - and i 'm sure you will get what you 
free internet 
beds and linens not that comfortable as expected 
free wifi throughout the hotel and room service is n't that expensive if you so choose 
but taking a bike ride to the outskirt of town is a must-do 
two big shopping malls are minutes away 
the pool is also warm 
perhaps we go a better room because it was our honeymoon and we also got a lovely surprise of 
the hotel is situated next to shangrila mall 
airport transfers and private local tours were reasonably priced and efficient 
and is situated in a lively neighborhood that does n't make you feel like you 're confined to 
awesome bathrooms 
the breakfast buffet was fabulous - so many choices - the vietnamese omelette made fresh was 
everything is scaled down in size- rooms are small 
free wifi is also an added bonus 
their rooms are spacious 
which was same size as superior but without a view 
i had a few really good meals here 
the pool was great esp for the kids 
but well maintained and rooms charming 
it is next to a mall and also the nelson mandella museum 
jose rizal park and the bay area 
they gym is new 
i was disappointed they do n't have a gym but they give you a pass to an excellent independent 
the pool attendants 
i loved the decoration and the view is brilliant 
be sure to ask which elevators you need to take to get to your room as the layout is 
being adjacent to a big mall with plenty food options and convenient for grocery 
the lounge has very nice skyline view of seoul 
nice business hotel - great service 
nice and huge hotel 
most nights we ate on the street at fast food cafes after the price shock at the hotels restaurant and 
new renovated rooms are stylish 
and a very small casino 
but a lower floor can help ( heat rises ) 
same price you get a suite 
whilst the lobby is spacious and grand 
housekeeping was n't aware of my late checkout ( which i arranged for at checkin ) and 
the lobby is very nice and clean 
the staff at the executive lounge are very nice and helpful 
this one was top notch 
very limited food choices 
however you will need to pay for internet access if you are in your room 
and there is an hourly shuttle bus to itaewon but you have to accept you are not 
it is very close to the train station and the forbidden city 
even the lobby is great 
the edges are yukkie3 ) expensive internet access us 20 
vacuum cleaning under furniture as well 
i will definitely be staying at this property on my next trip to beijing 
the nearest subway stop is a five minute walk north 
we were greeted with a cold drink whisked off to our accomodations 
the hotel rooms are ok and the staff and service is friendly 
the classic car ride around the city is great fun 
we got strip-view side and the view was great 
i was upgraded to a junior suite and the room was quite comfortable 
the only issue was the lack of hot water in the shower on a very cold morning but was quickly 
the staff was very pleasant and went out of their way as our room upon entering smelled of smoke 
they hotel offers free drinks and munchies in the evenings from 5 
the room rates are expensive but it certainly is worth staying here for even one night 
limited options and the food is below average 
n nthe room was extremely comfortable with very responsive air conditioning and a fabulous view of bristol 
breakfast was busy but the quality was really good 
the spa is amazing especially the jiva boat spa experience is a truly unique way of experiencing uda 
lobby bar was never open 
the shower head was so low anyone over 5 foot 6 could not take a proper shower 
we ate breakfast in the remaining dining room which had a good choice of cold buffet together with hot euro 
welcome on our first ever visit to the city 's was just the ticket 
this is a modern contemporary hotel with car parking ( 10 night ) ideally located within 10-15 minutes 
the concierge was very helpful in the lobby and recommended some pretty good hotels 
good hotel but needs to sort its parking well run clean hotel but parking can be a nightmare at peak 
well worth staying like royalty 
the underground station is a 10 minute walk away 
some of the best indian food we have eaten and a pleasant pool in which to cool off after 
the staff were all friendly & helpful 
any restaurant you walk into your guaranteed outstanding service & food 
despite what i normally would consider comfortable bedding 
and the concierge is especially helpful with transportation and sightseeing arrangements 
intercontinental sao paulo is one of the nicest hotels i have come across in my 
then on arriving at the hotel they treat you like maharajah and maharani by throwing 
we generally stay at taj hotels when in india -- the mumbai property is absolutely fantastic -- 
this is a beautiful and stunning hotel with a tranquility inside the courtyard by the pool that is like 
only a showerlarge swimming pool 
we had a wonderful day relaxing around the pool and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this oasis of a 
stayed in a luxury grande palace room in the heritage palace wing 
visited for business for 3 nights and the rooms 
a breakfast one can only imagine and a bed that dreams are made of 
i was treated like visiting royalty 
a short cab ride to the port at sunset is a good thing to do and there is a seafood 
well located for sights 
and on the second day the hotel staff were kind enough to change it for us 
prompt food and room service and easy check out 
the staff in the executive lounge are friendly and efficient and this is a better choice for breakfast than the 
2 daily free soft drinks from the mini-bar 
an amazing palace of a hotel in mumbai 
with an enclosed court yard and verandahs 
great pool area and great staff 
check in was smooth with usual warm thai hospitality 
from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty 
for the price we paid i would say this hotel represent a very good value for money 
about 3 minutes' walk is great - very good food 
over friendly warm staffvalue for moneyi did n't like the fresh orange juice so they did n 
either phaya thai or victory monument with a stiff walk if you have luggage along crowded and broken 
it is a truly beautiful building and still earns its iconic status 
with the spacious lobby and huge swimming pool 
the food spread is amazing 
the executive rooms are obviously nicer and larger than the normal room and give you access to the executive lounge 
enjoyed our time here- great pool 
breakfast was available in two restaurants - the nicest was the sealounge which has a lovely view 
service staff was very attentive and restaurants were great 
like the small pool 
is vey close to victory monument bts with a very frequent tuk tuk shuttle to and 
it is one of the best taj property 
this is my first time staying at this hotel but not my first time at the pullman chain 
a brilliant pool and great staff 
deluxe room provide 2 complimentary drinks ( non alcohol ) from the mini bar 
good restaurants ( 1x international 
there is a great small massage shop right opposite the hotel ( white color front door ) 
with comfy beds and a great bath 
on every level this hotel is excellent 
was top notch 
we all tried the spa which was good but being underground ( where the spa is located ) during the 
this was our first visit to innsbruck ( a family of four with 2 kids ) 
a few nice boutiques in the hotel if you want to avoid the hustle and bustle 
the hotel is very centrally located and right next to shopping and eating joints 
standard room with basic amenities 
and the front desk needs to be more efficient 
i just loved it and intend going back to see more of these wonderful hotels 
this hotel is with out doubt the best hotels in bombay and one of the best in all of 
the rooms are very well appointed and although modern 
the rooms are just fabulous and really luxurious 
from what i can see many chain mumbai hotels are near the airport that is a long way from 
we have stayed in at least 3 other hotels on this trip that have been just as good if 
we had been in hotel for pre-match drinks and food and had contributed well to the takings 
free wifi was fast 
in fact the place is very luxury 
the hotel has an impressive rectangular block design with a lobby showing old olive trees 
very nice buffet breakfast 
low lighting 
top notch five star hotel with great rooms and excellent service from a great team 
alternatively there is subway station just next to the hotel 
dinner very nice and great cocktail bar 
close to main shopping area and 5 mins walk to transport hub 
the rooms above the restaurants outdoor terrace can also hear people 's talking & other noise late into 
we were told the staff was fully aware that the rooms with carpeting had a nasty 
plus the building itself is an architectural masterpiece and the location extremely convenient 
do n't expect big luxury 
fun and not expensive . 
even when picking a low temperature ) 
always opt for a palace room- sea-facing if possible 
sea facing rooms have amazing views 
the main issue at the moment is the large construction site next door 
particularly the bookstore ( why do not all hotels have good bookstores ? 
they had limited options in the indian section and the masala dosa was not that great 
right in the heart of miraflores with plenty of restaurants and stores all around it 
rooms are a little on the small size 
everything about the hotel is entirely adequate 
the concierge staff was very helpful-arranging dinner reservations and such 
comfortable and lounge was excellent 
this hilton has all of the trimmings of any international hilton property 
the restaurant talverna is great ( sit on the terrace at sunset ) 
room is perfect size 
on our return we had some of the best breakfasts that we have had in the states something 
bed and hotel are in great condition and very comfortable 
choose a room with a balcony - small but perfectly formed 
keep up the high standards of welcome and hospitality 
executive lounge is rather small and offer limited food 
good location on kensington high street although a bit of a hike to the nearest tube station 
so we ate quickly and quickly headed back to the main hotel 
everything in this hotel is perfect - the service is flawless 
it 's definitely not the regular standard novotel hotel that i had stayed before 
with pretty wall paper and classic furniture 
basic amenities ( including slippers ) are absent from room by default 
with free internet 
very pleasantly decorated in the style of a beach house 
the wallpaper was peeling and there was blood on the comforter 
and interesting building 
nice clean bathroom 
a truly magnificent property ( as in the actual building 
where i have hardly enough space to walk around the bed as the ceiling is low and you are right 
this means that most major sights and attractions are within easy walking distance or if you are not so inclined 
good sleep quality 
close to airport but nothing special , we are members and were told we should go up to the 
nice workout facility 
many nice restaurants around 
amazingly helpful staff 
the hotel is around 20-30 minutes away from the airport depending on the traffic and they provide free 
big and comfortable ( with free wireless in the room for marriott members ) 
2 blocks and you have access to everything in the athens area 
fourth the service is highly impressive for concierge to help you anything you need 
if you are in manila for some nice shopping and cheap and good spa 
and as an owner of a large apartment with all the whistles and bells this fell down on some 
the room again a nice upgrade to a higher category on the 5th floor facing the eiffel 
chose the cafe everyday - choices aplenty and coconut ( when in season and available ) is 
however this hotel is an absolute gem and i think my search for a place to stay in par 
perfect for attending the conference and various meetings 
very nice for the price 
the tea room is nicely decorated and service is excellent 
great open area for drinks and meeting people 
but weights are limited to dumbbells ranging up to 50 lbs 
the price was very reasonable also 
the lobby is beautiful and the rooms are a nice size for a paris hotel 
housekeeping do a good job and hotel staff are helpful 
those with access to the intercontinental club lounge are truly spoilt throughout the day with multiple offerings that 
make sure to check with the front desk about times 
we would love to return to stay at ic le grand as my parents said the rooms were beautiful 
the service was a1 and the food was some of the best food we have had since being here 
it is a nice hotel but as one would expect 
a single roll-in bed 
japanese or mix and match dishes as you walk along the serving line 
the hotel has very small rooms 
they have a nice pool and bar to enjoy the day as well as an excellent lobby bar for evenings 
the coffee bad 
the higher floors have better views 
the property is located very close to the reagan airport with shuttle services to the airport and the nearby 
room was large with a balcony on the 3rd floor with a great street view 
the better options 
very expensive service ( roomservice' cocacola 12 euro ) ) ) ) 
we opted for a deluxe room for the extra space ( it also seems to get you a better 
it is also next to an entrance to the skyway so getting into makati is quite easy 
one thing that would be an improvement would be better ironing boards as the one in my room was 
as it is only a short walk from most tourist sights in central vienna 
a really central and high quality accomodation for oxford 
staff in the lounge were friendly and attentive 
slow drain shower 
just a small clothes cupboard 
and very nice facilities 
it also had a large marble tub and it was all separated from the bedroom by a glass wall that 
i believe it is one of the best hotels in kiev 
they have an excellent wine list and wonderful food 
from the hotel you can enter the shopping mall next door that offers shops 
great food options 
rooms are old but facilities are all good 
elegantly decorated and quiet 
the only thing is that there price is higher than average 
this was n't the best i could review 
good alternative to the airport hotels on premise 
the suite is very bright with a good view of the city and sizable for a family 
the nearest train station is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel 
mini fridge and good size bathroom 
it is very close to the markets and on the outer edge of the free tram zone 
this review may read like a rant 
although ibis is a budget hotel it is well located close to most things in melbourne including many 
the bed was hard as a rock and the bathroom to be avoided but for the most urgent matters 
set at the warmest setting ( 26c ) it was still uncomfortably cold 
i had some problems with the free wifi offered 
quality amenities were made available as well 
jasper town is only 5 mins away by car but the escape to patricia lake was very welcome 
then this property is a sure bet 
the people at checkout were great and the room was as well 
who provided wonderfully warm customer service with an eye for details 
very well equipped room 
on the first day our room was n't cleaned yet at 4pm and when i asked to have 
i was impressed with how quiet the overall property was 
and spacious bathroom 
outstanding i booked the hotel with my points and was extremely happy . 
the good thing is how close everything is and how easy you can access the parks and the village 
hotel is very big and it requires space for breakfast twice bigger that existing 
had to wait some time for my room to be ready - even though it was within the check in 
the contrast with this property and the renaissance arc de triomphe around the corner was dramatic 
slow bar service in atrium and exorbitant prices ( euro 50 for shrimp and chips ) 
super breakfast spread and the california grill is amazingca n't wait to be back 
big wardrobe 
felt like we received a great value and got exactly what we were expecting 
an extremely wonderful hotel in a great setting 
the property has a number of restaurants that serve excellent dishes 
had a great afternoon tea at the table bay hotel 's lobby lounge 
outstanding service with ones own butler 
our family room was very spacious ( other hotels would actually call it a junior suite ) and perfect for 
good size rooms butif you want an early call do check it has been processed 
coffee is the worst i have tasted but that seems the same island wide 
the outdoor swimming pool area is compact but i think it is better than most of the other hotels in 
but once inside it is a really beautiful hotel with excellent facilities and service 
if you have children and in need to extra bed 
but if you are not looking for a big pool - this is the place to be 
limited veg selections which became quite boring after 5 days 
tried buffet breakfast it was nice 
the check in are is amazing ( really flash ) and people at reception were really nice 
having said that the staff in this hotel were very friendly 
great massage and then a 15 minute couples bath in the open air which was a very enlightening experience 
good value 
sauna center roof top bar and sitting area and a swimming pool too 
great buffet breakfast 
for an overnight business trip this was more than adequate 
the pool is a bit all over the place and has a cold feel to it 
the coffee is freshly brewed unlike the instant coffee you get elsewhere 
they told me cost effective ways around denmark 
was upgraded to an exec room with my ambassador membership and the first no smoking room i was given st 
a bit disappointing stayed here for the last night of our honeymoon after being on royal davui 
was surprised at check-in with an upgrade to a fabulous room 
the room was spacious 
- my bed did n't feel as heavenly as in other hotels in this chain . 
generally the best service is in south east asia 
convenient location and very good wifi 
not enough towels 
required a hotel for a night 's stay before catching an early flight the next morning to zur 
very beautiful and relaxing 
the only improvement i would appreciate would be more comfortable mattress as after one night i got a pain in 
friendly staff , well maintained - nothing over the top . 
we shared a hamburge rand a salad one night and they were awesome 
so it was a very good value 
close to a metro station but everything else is really bad 
obtained a great price through accor website 
a great transit hotel located about 5 minutes away from heathrow 
from the time you check in - where they serve you cava champagne while waiting for your room keys 
with great restaurants 
the in-room safe looked like a bank vault and the couch at the foot of the bed just 
correct but pricy wifi extremely expensive 
our room was a good size and very clean 
conference facilities are also good 
the food in the bar was very good which you would expect but the other restaurant was fully booked 
a short business trip to seoul 
it is on a retail park with cinema opposite so great for since travellers as well 
the gym was excellent 
i was tired and just let it go since i was leaving in the morning and there were other clean 
if this was good value we 'd stay here again 
looks good on surface 
double the size of any other room we have had whilst staying in japan 
which provides easy access to the main train and subway lines 
my only slight complaint is that the pool is a bit soulless and the gym a little small 
maybe not the nicest pool we saw but good enough to swim and enjoy being out 
as was the heated toilet seat 
coombe abbey sits on a public park where all sorts of 
the only downside is the location is a bit out of town but the hotel does offer a free shuttle 
was very good value 
very convenient location 
room is spacious and clean 
the suite is a decrepit 
from all the hustle and bustle on the street as soon as you pull into the driveway you 
but its a short 3 taxi ride away 
great services and good stay 
great shops 
room was what you would expect and ok priced 
staff is great and location perfect 
would stay there for sure 
the concierge lounge was very good with an excellent selection of comp drinks and snacks during the evening 
great cocktails and good cappuccinos 
the facilities and the hotel was as expected - nice and clean 
get a high floor to have the nice views 
the hotel is a bit out of the way for the central business district but worth the travel time and 
the lobby and public areas of the hotel are extravagant on par of not better than other world class 5 
the dinner was less imaginative than the food served in the spa 
one of the nicer shopping centres located right next door to the hotel and plenty of bars 
the hotel has all the facilities you need 
breakfast is excellent but the restaurants could be disappointing 
the lobby was beautiful 
we did n't do alot of tge activities because it was hot but the pool and golf was 
absolutely wonderful stay 
had a work outing here at the top floor and boy were the views incredible 
the rooms are mediocre and the restaurants are mediocre - the pool is definitely mediocre and beware 
they look after their guests very well and the front desk is accommodating with regard to guests concerns 
the rooms are excellent and the staff are personable and helpful 
literally walk outside at 11 
great hotel in a great city 
the building is beautiful and historic and it is right in the heart of mexico city center 
the only thing that could be a bit better is the gym 
i spent one night there and have been provided a complimentary upgrade to a fabulous corner room 
no good pastries 
we were promptly taken care of by the friendly front desk personnel on arrival 
used glasses were not cleaned and cleared away ) and amenities in the bathroom were not replenished 
great hotel amazing staff 
the room was small 
cheap towels and bring your own amenities 
spa treatment was very good and ambiance very relaxing ( but modern ) - pool looked really great 
from start to finish this was an amazing four days punctuated by a great choice of activities and the 
there were incredible floor-to-ceiling windows with great views 
everything was good and we had a great dinner at the chinese restaurant on level 1 
the weil will definitely on our top list in our next visit to ipoh 
adjacent to the hotel is a small village square with useful shops 
the service was professional and i believe many of the people here will agree 
our experience at front desk was pleasant although a little slow 
the swimming pool is small 
it is as expensive as your own bedroom 
the hotel is situated right smack in the middle of town so moving around was also a breeze 
there was a fridge with complimentary cans of coke and sprite 
the rock and the park are amazing and the sounds of silence dinner a memory forever 
location is prime and convenience just above the subway station 
the restaurants are amazingly good too 
( very good review ) the negative 
the toilet had a separate shower and bath and a fully automated toilet bowl from toto 
a nice property but messy check in process 
especially the housekeeping and room service 
room was spacious and clean 
the resort was not cleaned - the ground whilst we were there 
too high priced when compared to our stay at mandarin oriental in the same trip to tai 
two front desk employees that are of exceptional merit are federico and vladislav 
the room was tired 
chinese restaurant on top floor also so do 
otherwise catch the citiair 1960 bus at the city hall bus station right next to the hotel 
the hotel reception was located at a different level 
ask for quiet room 
lazing at the side bed with coffee at one hand and enjoying that view is just heavenly 
the hotel has also a nicely designed small swimming pool 
at 10pm the area from hotel to the rooms was full of beatles and some got into the 
amazing restaurants & bars clubs 
bed is indeed hard ( for my taste ) 
tidbits were tastefully decorated in little test-tubes and it is the oriental influence 
still not cheap - but a better price 
the hotel called this smaller room a complimentary 'upgrade' 
they give free room upgrades if you book on their website directly 
with an extremely long wait between courses - probably not the best choice if you have an early start the 
the bathroom is a bit dated 
staff looks very stylish and fashionable 
separate bath 
floor at bottom of pool was dirty ( although water was clean ) the hotel has been recently refurbished 
and i 've seen a lot better showers in lower category hotels 
it 's very close to the airport and the rock 
very luxe and comfortable hotel with service to match 
great dining options along with a great top floor view 
these are the typical standard hotels you expect in uk europe unless you pay huge money 
this hotel has a fantastic view and an amazing poole area 
so the noise can be pretty loud off the balcony even with the door closed 
breakfast was included into our package and the spread is international and quality good 
) -- try the excellent spa-- the breakfast buffet on the lobby level is quite good 
a short walk away from 101 
but something else that guests should bear in mind is that all d sseldorf taxis already have 
in the same building is also a rental car where you can rent a car at reasonable rates 
i got an access to the executive lounge and they provide you with complimentary dinner there 
chaotic front desk 
huge bed 
bangkok chic stylish thai hospitality ! 
the hotels gym is small but effective 
the staffs are helpful 
all elevators are in order so there was no queue . 
not worth the hassle you can find better 
i stumbled into this restaurant when i was in a business meeting last month 
and i did not bother trying the free internet 
one of the best in a city of great hotels 
the bed and the pillows were extremely comfortable 
friendly staffs and le club member much appreciated here 
i do not intend to reuse a wet bath towel in the evening if i used it in the morning 
breakfast was plentiful and the cafe downstairs serves up excellent meals if you 're not in the mood 
obviously not recommended for sharing with others unless you are ok with the shower situation 
this is where you 'll find more authentic okinawan food at very reasonablle prices - 
i stayed a sofitel so for four nights a water themed club roomthe hotel is in a 
as always plenty of toiletries and fantastic free mini bar 
i wish i had had a few more days here i will stay at this hotel again on my next 
the location is right next to the monorail station 
the bungalows are spacious with a small garden facing the living area 
wonderful oasis 
some minor glitches 
needed to learn how to enchant the customer like sofitel so staff in bangkok 
the hotel is in a charmingly rustic residential neighbourhood just outside of town 
i hope that all the staffs and facilities get better 
i think the rooms are soundproofed well 
excellent service really helpful staff 
this property is adjacent to big convention center 
banky makes the guest welcome and connects with them almost immediately 
quirky great sized rooms 
- the room service was not great and very expensive 
we actually quite like the smart tv where internet access is also possible 
i like it because it is near to the mall and some good eateries named brown bag which 
it was a beautiful pool 
the room was of a generous size with all the modern gadgets 
i found this hotel a useful base during a recent visit to dc 
no double beds available and it goes downhill from there 
booked into mercure ( same reception ) and offered upgrade to pulman king room for 30 
our room was spacious 
smiling staff and modern stylish design 
mini bar free 
with a huge bathroom including a separate shower and a tub with a spectacular view 
i always recommend high floors because of the view 
you can also leave 2 garmets a day for dry cleaning free of charge 
the buffet overall was disappointing but most evident was the undercooked meats - most of which we had returned 
the hotel is wonderful and the staff is amazing 
rooms - be sure to check the different room types 
i would look for something less pricey 
the staff were efficient and friendly and the room was spacious and clean 
the lobby and open areas are still beautiful 
the rooms were beautiful and the bathroom and spa bath were huge 
the venetian is well situated close to the main vegas sights 
the waiting staff were 100 and the meal was high-quality 
excellent . 
it is a very large hotel but worth going in to visit for a couple of hours 
i then called a third time but to reception instead of room service and the man there answered after a 
45pm but still offered me the house special meal package 
walking into the spacious lobby the hotel is polished and relativley spartan 
it has good amenities ( canyon ranch 
denver 's best shopping within 2 mins walk and tons of great restaurants just around the corner 
the fitness center had a number of machines 
but things are close in taxis ) 
lovely hotel all the way around with excellent service 
on first view the hotel is not an architectural masterpiece 
i had to request the supervisor twice ( granted i 'm scottish so maybe my accent is 
ugly building but great modern room 
there are many other properties on strip that cost less and are still very clean 
not your usual bland hotel room 
unusually for rooms in this area there are plenty of powerpoints and very good internet connections 
the only thing i did n't like was the bar next to check in 
excellent size with seperate sunken lounge however the lighting is minimal 
we had the concerige package where you can go to the 12th floor ( from memory ) 
housekeeping services were amazing 
the hotel was decorated with huge american flags and special flowers for their arrival ceremony ( which we missed 
arrival experience was good and the check in was swift 
we stayed here for 4 nights and very contented about it 
i had a hard time pulling myself away for a couple of nights on my last trip to bangkok 
so during the day there are general conveniences ( though the closest laundromat took 5 days to 
this is a very quiet area but there are a number of western restaurants and fast food joints in the 
beautiful bathroom 
the location is near fuchengmen tube station 
considering the options available in the city as well as the particular area 
well equipped gym and spa 
the house of sathorn restaurant next door is also awesome 
a very memorable hotel stay 
did not stay but had to write accidentally booked a smoking room got to the hotel staff at the front 
however i found that the conditioner had gone off and smelled bad 
the bar was great as usual 
my friends and i stayed two nights last weekend in w bangkok 
overall a good business hotel 
we would 've reported these concerns personally but reception staff did n'tactually ask if we enjoyed our 
to handle several thousand rooms 
quirky decor and a great view of bangkok will revive the spirit greatly 
this hotel seems to be an amalgam of several buildings 
and more tranquility in popular brand hotels better sticking with st regis or ritz carlton 
breakfast buffet has a great selection but can be quite busy at times 
and will definitely come back here again should i visit bangkok the next time 
check in and check out if a bit of a nightmare due to the size of the property and the 
great range of restaurants and shops ( restaurants are not cheap but fairly standard for vegas resorts ) 
strong perfume smell pervasive throughout property 
the location is also a good start to explore the strip or even beyond 
one of the best rib eye steaks ever 
it was a breakfast experience not worth having and not worth paying for 
the bathroom is a good size but not quite as large as the wynn 
food was decent though and the lobby bar had some good drinks and lots of evening action 
rooms were large and very spacious 
there were some nice restaurants but we only managed to eat at 3 
it had no resemblance to an upscale w property 
we stayed in this wonderful hotel for three nights last week 
being such a large hotel the distance one has to walk tends to be much greater than other hotels 
very modern furniture 
the bed was comfy and the oversize boxing gloves are way too cute 
one of the best bars in bkk 
this is a charming hotel located just a few blocks from the main mosque on one side 
being a strictly muslim country , food is not consumed between sunrise and sunset so breakfast was served 
a cool touch in the room is that fact that you can control it all via an ipad that 
the one thing that impressed me about this property was the beautiful elevator lobby on each floor and the very 
we were on the 29th floor and the view was great across the city to the distant mountains 
right around the corner from cafes and the overground 
dining table and work desk -- enough seating to fit 9 people 
nice decorations and big rooms 
you could barely move with the 2 double beds made up 
double bed very comfortable 
room a good size but very small bed 
light foods and drinks 
they run an exceptional property and their staff really understand and deliver the five star experience 
both the rooms and breakfast were good 
it really perks up your day 
and for breakfasts - you could n't beat bouchons 
are included in the room rate and very good-both in variety and quality 
huge in size but not particularly well made 
upgraded to a fantastic suite w complimentary cocktails at bar on the first night 
bed area is separated from a sunken living room area so if you have 4 people to a 
this just feel too big with very little furniture 
the bar is really trendy and extremely loud so it is n't for everyone but i thought it had 
just opposite the main mall and close to plenty of choice for eating out 
we were surprised compared to westin standards in asia , some maintenance refurbishment would be most 
price is a bit high at thb2 
the bathroom was large and the shower head felt like rain drops 
t chose this hotel because it sometimes takes you 10 minutes to go from lobby to your room 
good size rooms and comfortable beds 
it was clean and spacious 
we had excellent house keepers and the overall facility and service was a very high end 4 star experience 
they have really captured the feel of venice well and was a pleasure to sit in the main square 
the suites are luxurious and spacious compared to other hotels in las vegas and the location was excellent for 
the setting is modern and the hotel was quite 
it take a bit longer to walk but at least it will be quieter 
was beyond my expectations on staying in a budget hotel in singapore because the hotels are normally very strict 
well-designed and featured tall corner windows overlooking camoes square 
plenty of food options nearby 
a delicious breakfast is served each day in their charming lobby-level restaurant and their terrace bar has 
an excellent experience had - outstanding property with top class amenities 
we had a late evening flight and they kindly arranged a late check out and use of the executive lounge 
this hotel is another viable and wonderful alternative with easy access to airport as the main reason 
but for a similar price that is still within easy walk to the mrt you can do a lot 
overall a good hotel and i 'm sure the resort has a very different feel in the ski 
it has a full small kitchen and a beautiful view 
he was apologetic & upgraded us to premier room at a high floor with a nice view 
everything smells fresh and looks clean 
bathroom and rooms itself are tiny tiny tiny you can barely fit 2 people with 2 luggage there and 
- the bed - very comfy 
the lobby is impressive 
while the lobby and common areas were quite nicely decorated and very comfortable 
listed over met transport so easy access to trains and buses 
its a tourist hotel with tour buses outside and very full lobby 
the only issue is that the pool is not really set up for laying out - only 1 lounge chair 
the restaurant very good and they have a wonderful pianist every night playing in the bar 
we had to call and be redirected to the main entrance on a small lane 
the separate bedroom ( upstairs ) and sitting area and huge bathroom downstairs 
room sizes are good and i love that 
this is a convenient hotel for business in the area - lots of shops and restaurants nearby ( as well 
but it ticks all the boxes and is in a perfect spot between the airport and the city 
the bathroom is quite big 
you wo n't leave the breakfast room hungry 
one of the least pleasant hotels i came accross on a business trip in asia 
giant double beds 
good wifi with pretty good speed 
the property is fairly well maintained though the interiors of the rooms and public spaces do look worn and 
all raved about the resort and their new year 's eve experience for days after 
first stay in an ibis styles category hotel and first time staying within namba 
7-11 store is jut beside the lobby and you can grab anything in an instant 
the rooms are very large compared to most hotels and open plan design 
absolutely gorgeous property and super friendly staff 
the location is excellent-right on the piazza barberini between the trevi fountain and 
needing good internet access was important for us to be able to communicate with our overseas office 
bathroom was spacious with very nice amenties 
when we realised the hotel was virtually empty we thought they should have given us the upgrade with no extra 
the grand deluxe room was excellent with views over the pool and river 
also it is a walking distance to famous old town 
however , the breakfast team are the cream . 
special note the fresh orange juice 
right across the street is a mini-mart which is quite useful 
adequate and the beds a lot firmer and more comfortable 
it was a miserable way to end a trip to a great country 
) and received some complimentary chocolates 
rather 1960s-1970s hotel with nice views from the higher rooms 
unattractive , very dated , slightly outside of the center ( close to the domestic airport though , 
the use of the internet at the business centre is almost free 
the location at the river is very nice - even it gives you some noise from the restaurants located there 
the concierge knowledgable and helpful 
a large marble bathroom 
the location was very convenient to all sight-seeing and shopping 
the problem was that although there were rooms available they had n't been cleaned 
there is a lovely patio off the lobby restaurant where one can enjoy an evening cocktail or nightcap with 
the hotel staff is very friendly 
for arrivals we had a ten minute journey by train and then the shuttle bus which we had to wait 
the comfortable bed is a blessing for one who is sick 
the bed is firm and the pillows are comfy 
good bar and food with friendly staff 
it was the perfect relaxing retreat from the busy city 
other than that we had a very satisfactory stay 
love how quiet the resort is ( do n't know if it 's because of low occupancy of 
the room size was great and the helpful friendly staff were a delight to see each day 
and the free shuttle is a great idea 
it 's located in the main city street 
having the bathroom separated by a hallway from the bedroom was a nice layout 
great private beach 
it 's a bit outside the city center ( think 
the property is incredibly located 
- to have a mini-mart and atm next to the hotel 's back entrance is convenient 
nice facilities 
it is a nice hotel with a great staff 
stay in the city expect parking be expensive 
albeit a very small shower stall 
n nskip breakfast at this hotel and go to the diner just a few doors down - greater choice 
and within easy walking distance to the metro 
i like to charge my phone overnight and have my phone by me as it serves as my alarm 
the food was good but not spectacular 
the room are big by todays standards and the bathroom was very spacious 
it is also near prime shopping areas of toronto 
we were up and out early so the noise did n't affect us that much 
buffet breakfast cozy just can be much better 
you 're faced worn a beautiful chandelier and elegant entry 
spacious shower and separate tub ) 
across from the rom and near yorkville and subway was convenient 
i had some excellent ginger-grapefruit martinis and scrumptious clams and ch 
coupled with good service 
bar service was efficient and friendly 
very good quality of sleep 
if you suffer the misfortune of arriving at stansted airport on a very delayed easyjet flight at 
the next day i mentioned this and was immediately moved to a newly refurbished room 
the lobby and coffee shop were well located . 
the breakfast is pretty impressive . 
front desk and concierge personnels are very service oriented 
the view at night of the danube was spectacular from my room and the lounge of the hotel 
nice room etc 
the view ( from my room ) was spectacular overlooking the river and the castle 
this is the most service oriented hotel i have ever stayed in 
our executive room on the top floor was well furnished although i always think that the bath is too narrow 
the blanket in the bed is as thin as paper 
yet impersonal and the rooms look like they do in the us 
the raddison blue hotel is the closet hotel to stansted airport terminals 
small table chairs 
easy to find with convenient parking 
an impressive building 
not cheap but well worth it for the tranquility you will need to discuss business 
and is located brilliantly next to the train station 
staff are very friendly and helpful 
- rooms and public areas all brand new and refurbished- lovely and clean- great breakfast- friendly 
balconies are very dirty as are some of the common areas 
in the afternoon the kids could enjoy the nice swimming pool and relax 
the whole ayers rock voyages resort is a monopoly so beware prices are extremely high 
at the end of the city 's main street 
( this is the slow ferry to a 
the bathroom is fantastic and comes with all the fittings and trimmings of a high quality hotel 
2 sizes of pillows are on your bed 
but you do need to cross a relatively busy street to get there 
clean rooms and bathrooms 
bathroom was nice with a good shower 
a gift in the room and drinks voucher but apart from the drinks voucher we got no other benefits 
nice pool 
sails have the superior swimming pool and the hotel is a slight upgrade to the desert 
bar area nice 
location for airport excellent 
so i can compare with other hotels worldwide 
stayed at the mahkota as hotels were limited in melaka for the night we were staying 
there was a small bottle one could purchase for 8 
walk in shower with great water pressure 
the executive lounge was very busy and looked like a temporary set up 
beautiful property with impeccable service in amsterdam . 
the only thing is rate is almost double that of other international hotels like hyatt regency during the 
the hotel location is absolutely awesome 
but he could change our room on the second 
i was horrified & also terrified that how can the maintenance be so poor 
located right next to the airport 
the executive lounge snacks were good but the lounge was poorly staffed 
but it is very clean and easy to walk to 
across the street and you 're in the front-door 
the room on the second floor was very quiet and i enjoyed a good night sleep 
the hotel is a modern business hotel 
work desk and lovely bathroom with a tub made up for it 
with many attractions within easy reach ( eg a 15 minute walk to uss midway ) the lobby was 
great pizza 
free for all guests 
which is big plus for 1st time visitors like me and family with small kids 
the room was very nice 
we felt that the standards that had been set throughout our stay were consistent right through to the end with 
the design and ambiance is great after their renovation 
6 ) there are three high end restaurants - french 
reception on the top floor 
as soon as you get down from the hotel you will see different shops and restaurant 
water was coming out of the shower glass door so we had to always have two towels on the floor 
if this property falls within your price range 
i think it 's due to the prime location 
very modern interior in the public zone and in the rooms 
rooms are gd sized and the bathrooms clean 
an underground walkway next to the hotel leads to the large lotte department store which has the duty 
with all amenities in your room this hotel gives you value for money 
with satin blanket and very comfortable huge bedding making every night sleep nice 
hotel has been rebuilt couple of years ago and since then it become one of the top hotels in 
the airport bus stops right outside the hotel which is easier to catch then the train 
the breakfast was reasonably good as was our dinner though expensive 
occasional bad smells come through the air con 
but it is in public areas 
lotte shopping mall is also within reach 
lotte ) nearby for double the price 
though the estimated journey to incheon airport is about 30 minutes 
small restaurants and also ginza behind 
all suites in three different set up and prices with your own private jacuzzi with a breath 
they provided s mobile phone free of charge to take it around with and you only pay for the outgoing 
i certainly do not feel it offers good value 
shower 's water pressure was great and water heater worked very well throughout 
the quality and overall service is unbeatable 
the cafe beside the beach was full of bugs 
the resort is a 15 minute walk to the nearest town and there is no atm in the resort 
the bedding was very comfortable 
and the gluten free bread that arrived ( as much as we wanted without a specific charge ) 
right downtown and also the airport bus stops right outside 
the hotel has its own underground parking and the charge was very reasonable 
easy to get to in an area i have stayed before and liked 
good gym 
its a good hotel and access to the executive lounge is worth it if you have the cash 
be sure to get in the breakfast line early 
the price is good and the airport transfer is great 
the in-house cake and coffee shop is as good as any tea house in uk 
very tastefully renovated hotel in singapore just a five to ten minute taxi trip from the main office 
came in late to bkk and decided to try something new for a change close to the airport 
a very cosy bar with great bartenders ( love the bar snacks ) 
perhaps the mgt should look into arranging a regular shuttle to and fro the airport as soon as 
the lobby very impressive 
nice pool 
linen could be of better quality 
the huge bed faced a large tv 
it was clean and had a new bathroom 
there are many casinos close by 
the outside dinning is great but 2 time it was full with one hour waiting time 
i ate in several of the restauraunts with a particularly amazing buffet in one place on the third floor 
there was a tv and free wifi in the room 
the price of the hotel came down to about 30 per person per night and that was a great price 
the same high price applied to all other items of clothing 
get higher floors to avoid noises 
the coffee shop where they serve breakfast is quite nice and its an elaborate spread but i often found the 
a very special hotel which was able to maintain its style and class during the war and has continued 
they are too pricey for the quality of terribly mediocre food 
with free drinks 
giving helpful tips of where to go in singapore as well 
it was a huge room with separate living area and was updated 
this was my first visit to cebu and i wanted to be near the asia it park 
the bedding was old and rough and i wore a t-shirt and basketball shorts because i did 
am really impressed with their grand lobby - spacious coffeeshop & imposing columns 
other benefits are being close to a shopping mall 
as per other reviews - busy and noisy if there is a party in the house 
the oldies would love to play the pokies at their huge casino 
cebu traffic is terrible and taxi hunting is a nightmare during peak hours but my last minute shopping 
a bit of shopping around and you can at least get a half decent deal 
beds are comfortable and the toilets are clean and reasonably big 
the amenities are well maintained and the staff is attentive and helpful 
afternoon tea was generous and lovely too with both sweet and savoury 
from the outside the building does not look attractive but approaching it is very grand 
the breakfast buffet was great 
the restaurants are great 
but having to go back to the front desk three times for the same problem was annoying 
large showers 
another anonymous business hotel 
just a few steps from the central station 
staff cant do any more for you 
not that many outstanding food outlets in the immediate square 
walk out the europlatz exit and go straight across the plaza ( which is really just a drop 
5 minute walk to central station -there is a restaurant and bakery co-located in the same 
this is a good value 
rooms were quiet and comfortable and price was reasonable 
i have had a very pleasant stays and thank you for all the staff and housekeeper made my journey 
i found the silver bird taxi service at the airport was convenient and reasonable cost for the level of comfort 
free bug repellant is available from the front desk on request 
or staying closer to the airport but decided to be closer to the airport 
which is a nice bonus 
there are also several restaurants to suit everyone 's taste 
and this is not ok because of the long walk to your room 
the hotel is a short walk to the marina and the old colonial district 
a large bedroom 
rooms were good with all facilities 
we simply reserved 45mins use of the hospitality suite free of charge 
nice touches include being able to control all lighting ac from your bedside 
bergen is a pretty small walkable town that 
the bed is probably double and the single bed for my kids were just tiny 
is this hotel even air conditioned 
the restaurant is very very good with one of the best chefs in rome 
location good but average 
the free internet was very quick ( 15mbps 9mbps ) even at busy times 
the building is a modern structure with the clean 
however ensure the mercedes taxis put you on the meter 
the room is n't cozy 
front desk polite but somewhat stiff or disconnected 
howeververy clean an moderne and very functional - you expect for such a price a bigger room 
so a bike ride or taxi ( which costs 20 each way ) is in order unless you like walking 
rooms large and restaurants amazing 
she then offered us a pacific suite for an extra sgd 160 nt allegedly on the same 
we had a little self contained cottage to the side of the main building 
it was my first time in the scottsdale area and first time to stay at a fair 
i reserved a deluxe room at the pan pacific for two nights 
the gym good and the lobby lounge very nice but getting checked in and getting a package and a stored 
facilities excellent 
this was most evident when my toilet overflowed at one point ( which whould not happen ) and 
lots of large pools and a lively vibe 
check-in staff were very pleasant and efficient and the lobby was very nice 
to conclude mo is french luxury at its very best 
on arrival we came into this luxurious resort 
the bathroom was spacious with a good selection of amenities provided 
food is great quality and it does n't stop - everything we had was tasty and they kept spo 
the food is outstanding and the game drives at 0600am and 0330pm ( includes sundowners 
maybe not quite the design 'wow' of a perfect spa but definitely very very good 
we had a courtyard facing room but if possible try getting a river facing room on the second floor 
loungers were comfortable and they offer towels 
came here for a short vacation 
pan pacific is a great example of the top notch service and attention to detail that you get in 
need extra hangers or an adapter 
we stayed here for 5 nights and had a wonderful stay 
hotel has amazing rooms 
the check in staff was friendly and helpful 
the rooms were huge 
check-in on 11th july for a 2 nights stay attending business conference at nearby suntex 
the beach is great also 
new rain shower 
a quick overnight pit stop on our trip 
we chose the 'fine dining' restaurant as the room is air conditioned and the prices seemed not too 
london gave the feeling of luxuryexcellent location adjacent to both city hall and promenade m 
on one end of singapore and close to the sea shore and surrounded by malls and super malls 
the service is attentive and the food is top-notch ( although slightly expensive compared to other options 
restaurant was good for buffet breakfast and evening meals but the set menu was a little disappointing 
it has a club lounge and the staff at the hotel is very friendly 
i liked that the hotel was out of the main town - very convenient for biking and rafting 
each with a large bed and each with a balcony overlooking the gardens and beautiful mountains 
but it is much easier to change the currency at the hotel reception 
awesome view and very reasonable prices 
the cereal and the toast was stale and inedible 
made better by the staff 
large and tastefully decorated room ( the huge wooden tub is a big plus ) 
the posh bathroom is quite modern zen with an overhead rainfall shower and a separate wooden bathtub 
an amazing hotel deserving of all five stars 
the whole hotel has a nice design touch and there are always some art pieces from li xiao f 
hotel offers free high speed wifi internet 
for single travellers or couple is recommended 
but the current 3 for 2 offer made it good value and i really enjoyed my time here 
good rooms 
it has a great location with great shopping and restaurants nearby 
the fantastic service z gives in booking the best seats in restaurants outside the hotel 
the free shuttle bus from the airport express train station stops right in front 
the minibar was free and stocked daily ensured i kept any hunger pangs at bay 
the free minibar is a nice addition 
fantastic restaurants 
check you in and out or just get you anything you need 
staff - the front desk were great conversational english very helpful 
not luxurious but certainly very good three star and exceptional value 
had a great view of the boulevard and the windows have this electronic blind which is great if you 
the buggy was available at all times to ferry us to breakfast and the wonderful gan atoll cultural 
the beed room and the bathroom ( which is very big and amazing with the outdoor shower and the 
the mountain is situated in the beautiful 9-hole golf course that over looks the end of the island 
email the hotel about this as hong kong station is huge 
there are some very pleasant bars & restaurants within 10 - 15 minutes walk as well 
our service was friendly and non-intrusive and our villa was exquisite 
many thanks to the friendly lady on reception 
beware when you order taxi as noone want to use meter - if you want to go to 
staff was nice overall 
we did not feel satisfied for this stay 
the rooms are modern and fair sized room considering it is hong kong 
the elevator set-up was a bit weird as only part of the elevators took you to ground 
good value for money considering the qualityhelful and very friendly staff 
rooms not facing freeway and pool are best -- far less noise 
the interior and rooms are really quite old and in considerable need of renovations 
i love spa and i think it is the best spa i have ever had 
there are also lots of casual restaurants serving very good food within a few blocks of the hotel 
the ocean view rooms are nice with a nice balcony 
breakfasts were served in the downstairs caf and they were great 
the only down side was that the room size was very small but you would except that for japan 
gracious staff will treat you like you were a president or a judge 
near the train station and shopping center 
while the immediate area is not particularly alive in the evenings 
5 goes direct from airport to the hotel door 
a real concierge with heart and soul who took excellent care of our every need and knew the 
diamond member so upgraded room and executive lounge was great 
while the hotel and lobby are upscale and modern 
and the outside building is still a mess 
as many have said the rooms are clean and well designed and mine was absolutely fine for one 
everything was new and bed was very comfortable 
minor issues that arose over the course of the stay were handled quickly . 
food and bar is very good as well 
i would say that they need to have a traditional food menu like 
small open bar area adjacent to but screened off from the road 
overnight parking is a bit expensive but that 's the way it is in most big cities 
from the front desk 
with a really good floor-level shower cubicle - though the operating mechanism took a bit of figuring 
what you expect - good service 
hot tub 
access from our car park was though a side door which seemed a little like a staff entrance 
great buffet breakfast in the cafe and a beautiful room 
cable channels plentiful 
service was still high quality even when the weekend bought in some events inside the hotel 
but if you want to be where the action is ( and you want consistently good quality ) 
the bed was very comfortable and i slept really well 
there were white bath robes 
and the award for the 2nd worst receptionist of all time goes to 
the bar by reception incidentally made one of the best gin and tonics i 've had using mom 
and one of the best features for me was the complimentary access to the attached equinox gym 
the lady on reception suggested twin beds was 'only a request' 
the minor difference in size and lack of a dining area was more than made up for by the bigger 
nice bath 
the rooms and bar area were also nice 
great location though 
the staff is attentive and the service excellent 
you can hear through thin walls and the view is ordinary 
high floor with a view of mt fuji 
the hotel is well located in downtown dallas 
the rooms are very well appointed while the prices remain reasonable 
nice quiet spot five minutes from town centre nice clean cabinvery slippery shower floor so be carefulnice location 
the bunk bar is great and the collage restaurant offers an exceptional range of food for both breakfast and 
there is a wonderful swimming pool 
marcel was very helpful in assisting us with our next accomodation 
the executive lounge was very good and staff very helpful 
i particularly liked the lobby bar which was a hit with team 
the property is a little away from the city centre ( which is a cluster of 15 buildings in all 
it has easy access to the art musuem at roppongi hills 
available hotels in sf in the past and ca n't believe i missed this one so close to 
they provide valet parking and there are plenty of asian restaurants nearby and good breakfast places down the 
you have a public parking just 300 meter away where you pay 15 -20 for a night 
not many hotels offer so much space and big bathroom like this one 
everything about this facility is wonderful 
it 's a solid hotel and i can see why it has many positive reviews but ( in my 
great location in roppongi 
it is one of the better one i have stayed in and the only disadvantage in my opinion is without 
the gym is very well appointed but small 
perfect central location 
wifi worked and full toiletries provided 
near to shopping and nice hotel 
a pure business hotel only grand hyatt is a great place to stay if you are there for business 
great location and very large hotel to tokyo standards 
food was cold and the quality of food was quite disappointing 
the bathroom is open concept with an enclosed shower cubicle and a toilet cubicle 
attractions and the subway stops right there - so convenient 
i ate the breakfast buffet in the french restaurant on the 2nd floor - equivalent to 41 for breakfast 
and a very good internet connection 
the staff were very friendly and helpful 
to operate at such a high level of luxury in port moresby must be quite a challenge 
a very lively area of tokyo 
small rooms ) 2 ) no free wifi 3 ) route subway station is not covered so bring an umbrella 
you will be received by humble staff and their personalised services are memorable 
service is good but room amenities are weak 
comfortable hotel with exceptional facilities 
like the small swimming pool and the old lobby 
located on the creek on the edge of sharjah and close to the airport 
nice looking pool adjacent 
to the room and the restaurants excellent food 
the lobby is large and well set out 
all up an interesting area 
so i can only bring my family to another san want hotel 
the rooms are very modern and the bathrooms with this oversized bathtubs and the fully automatic toilets are 
the pool water was warm and there was a sporadic bar service 
i stayed at the grand hyatt tokyo for a week in early march 2005 while on a 
the lebanese sweets they serve round the clock in their lounge was the best i have eaten and 
the hotel remembers your requests when you return -- so for instance 
lots of great restaurants shops etc around the hotel and in the hotel 
the main building is architecturally superb with the main building incorporating spectacular openness and flow 
comfortable hotel in old dubai 
with ample shopping and dining options nearby 
italian restaurant was good 
an excellent choice for easy city access 
it has a nice pool area with a bar and caf 
note that the shuttle is only available to the club members 
the hotel is well located for the airport - just 10 minutes away 
the pool is excellent 
on this stay i found the restaurant staff a little slow in providing service but the food could not be 
the beach has excellent water sports activities and you can also take boat ride for dolphin view 
the bar and restaurant on the ground floor had excellent coffee and the meals were excellent 
next door to central ststion so very convenient for transport 
this adina was excellent from warm welcome by a very group of friendly and very professional staffthe entire 
ample parking was available and finding the place was easy 
this earlier check-in was greatly appreciated and i seemed to be given a larger one-bedroom apartment 
the public areas are tatty 
their pool is really big and you can order snacks while sitting on stools right there on the pool 
they really should consider making the wireless internet free across the whole hotel for the price they charge 
good sized rooms and lot 's of history 
also at the pool some noise can be heard here from the building site next door 
with a light yet very warm duvet which perfectly suited the cold room 
meals were not an issue given there was also a good chinese restaurant in the neighbouring hotel property 
the facilities are high end 
a good hotel overall 
had already parked the car into long term parking next door and there is a door that leads right from 
the king bed was lovely 
i also wish there were a real lobby bar ( i never saw one ) 
the concierge desk staff is very knowledgable 
ask the concierge desk for real street food , they will provide you with excellent options for 
it is n't even that close to the airport 
bathroom and facilities were clean and comfortable and the buffet breakfast had a multitude of choices and overall was 
the overt mini bar was an excessively expensive and tacky detraction from an otherwise good room 
the hotel has everything and they did a nice job in renovating the lobby and the restaurants 
the cost is reasonable for what you expect for corporate travel 
the lounge area seemed very popular for afternoon tea and there is also a very lively bar in the evenings 
rooms are spacious and clean 
jeff and concierge desk very helpful 
typical high-end hilton 
it makes for more than a meal--it 's like a full buffet 
and getting good staff trained to a hilton standard is part of the challenge 
beautiful spa and fitness center 
this is a reasonable business hotel which was comfortable for a week 
but the highlight for me was the roof top pool 
rooftop spa and pool had great views 
very poor experience this time - room not ready 
nice gym 
staff is very friendly and the club lounge offers a good range of appetizers and drinks 
this afforded parents like us equal amounts of security and privacy at the same time 
the best city hotel in south-east-asia 
this hotel is located in front of brussel midi station where the trains goes for major cities 
the gym is big and well equipped 
cannot understand english well and need major training 
great place to have lunch had a business meeting fabulous setting nice menu not pricey at all all around great 
like the temperature control and the little ipad thingy showing the hotel information and the room service menu 
nice ambience and good service coupled with excellent facilities and relaxing rooms made our two-day stay at 
bathroom tub was rusty and the bathroom itself was very small 
making food choices plentiful 
not the biggest breakfast buffet i 've ever seen 
which is right downtown 
the staff are incredibly friendly 
checking in staff was helpful and also courteous 
( b ) the beauty of the foyer and public areas ( c ) the breakfasts -- 
radisson suites may mean smaller lobby but no need to spend time here 
staff and the food at opera and square one are fantastic 
you can almost see vancouver from the higher floors 
the location is quite interior to sukhumvit road but hotel provide tuk tuk facilities 
the bar and restaurant are of excellent quality and quite comfortable to sit and hang in 
good value breakfast 
rooms are spacious but basic toiletries are missing 
if you are a light sleeper then ensure you are not put in a room on the floor below and 
the best in town 
there was only one bed side lamp and no power points next to the bed 
i was on the 7th floor and unfortunately the paint smell ( from the 6th floor ) was 
we did n't stay at the hotel but had booked dinner at square one at the hotel 
i found oaks on collins to be a good property that i 'd stay at again 
the room was spacious with all of the amenities you 'd expect 
the bathroom is huge and probably larger than the sleeping area 
so if you are expecting to soak7 in a huge modern tub 
quite alive and crowded in the lobby 
good value , no frills located opposite the intercontinental on collins street at about half the price 
you can feel the fine luxurious interior 
the food at the pool bar is also very good 
as soon as you enter the front doors you get a feeling of calmness which is a great contrast 
but one of the best options for shanghai hotels 
spotty window exteriors and the feeling that carpets and shades are n't cleaned as often 
very clean with all the basic amenities 
only rolls available not sushi at all 
the public areas are classy and elegant 
you might want to stay elsewhere as traffic is terrible in mexico city 
with a great pool 
some of the interior decor & furniture i personally thinks needs an overhaul as it appears to be a tad 
ate in house a couple of times as it 's the rainy season and the food was good 
excecutive lounge is great 
tastefully decorated with excellent and friendly staff who were always willing to help and spoke excellent english 
we had the buffet breakfast only because it was complimentary 
right across street from shops and eating spots of all varieites 
nice fluffy beds and bed sheets 
breakfasts was good and food quality lived up to hilton healthy standards 
it has all the modern amenities you expect at a park hyatt 
grand contemporary lobby 
we spent a great deal of our holiday away catching up in the extremely pleasant lounge - the quality of 
the private taxi limo service is now available in hcmc 
swimming pool and area were well appointed and looked after and the spa facilities were excellent 
one of the best hotels in boston 
location is great for central mexico city 
great property with very friendly staff 
the spa only offers massages 
found the valet and front desk staff to be excellent 
the hotel is modern and well maintained and in a good central location 
we were at a charity do and the food was very good despite hundreds being served 
we had a special dinner at the moon deck and this will be something to remember forever 
and all the amenities one would expect of a 5 hotel 
the breakfast buffets is a bit monotonous - the same stuff every day 
radisson seems to be in the middle of the city so good location 
) not enough outlets in the rooms--and none at all near the desk table-- so that i 
this was my first visit to d sseldorf also first time to stay in indigo hotel 
the breakfast selection is good - not sure at 19 that it 's better value than local cafes but 
everything was perfect including the wonderful pillows and soft 
the lounge was very comfortable and again the service great 
we walked from piccadilly station and unfortunately it started to rain 
service was excellent - all the staff were very friendly and accommodating 
it was amazing and relaxing and like an oasis in the middle of the city 
check out experience was very good and the receptionist shook my hand and wished me happy new year and 
the room was very quite and quite roomy 
great bed pillow combo 
suited our needs perfectly 
i did request two single beds and had a copy of my booking receipt 
you can be in the shower by the time you would have found your car or taxi to the other 
the u-bahn station is very near and a number of sightseeings is within walking distance 
but if you plan to stay longer in berlin there are many more hotels at the same price point 
we did think about the fine dining one but it was a bit pricey and we only saw one couple 
the bed is very comfortable and the rooms have a fully stocked bar 
no hot water to shower in one morning and they simply did n't bother to call back to explain 
my suite was good 
an unexpected treat 
smallish but very clean with good aircon and comfortable beds 
it also has a beautiful view of bangkok across the river and offers space enough to disregard that you 
the pool area and patio by the riverside are fantastic 
the final frustration was waiting more than an hour for someone to bring us some linens for the extra 
the beer served in the lobby is apparently brewed on the spot 
excellent hotel , i will return ! 
but the selection close to the pool was fine - with the benefit of chiller cabinet for the fruit 
my wife had surf and turf which had a half lobster with a small piece of good steak 
staff very friendly beach lovely 
if the tuktuk has to go to the station , it has to return empty . 
they have an excellent pool and the restaurant has fantastic views overlooking the river 
maybe one extra person will be better not to wait for things like your car as they only can do 
i was on a high floor and enjoyed a really amazing view 
the only problem was it is at the edge of the tenderloin district so if you head the 
the lobby and public areas are beautiful 
they said no despite the hotel having lots of vacant rooms 
a three minute walk to the waterfront and the same to the citi bus stop for city tours 
stayed here a couple times for work related reasons since my last company stopped using starwood locations which 
the bedroom is large with comfortable bed 
but when i queried at the time in reception and later with their swiss hq 
dim lighting throughout the room ( which made working a challenge ) 
the bathroom is also well equipped 
several bars and restaurants 
all around a good place to stay 
ask for a quiet room 
there are numerous tasty restaurants nearby 
great facilities 
i received access to executive lounge and this is unluckily the only place where the complimentary breakfast for 
transport easy from main train station 
free soft drinks and water 
which was a nice touch 
i think the quality of the suite is more of a 4 star standard at most 
breakfast was of a better quality but again first lots of paperwork before they let you in 
the bathrooms are quite small and the tubs very high 
it is always well booked and probably there is no need for nice rooms or service ( both the hotel 
otherwise not a bad hotel - location is good and nice pool and gym 
approx 30min or so leisurely walk down to surfers paradise along the beach beach front 
meats and the obligatory captain 's dinner means selection are even better 
my only complain is the totally strange parking arrangement for the cars which was very confusing indeed 
the pool area is great 
the red walls area 
car park for hotel shared with shopping mall so be prepared to hunt for car park everytime you return 
the elandra club upgrade is worth it for a little peace and quite 
the hotel lobby was grand 
and chose to eat at the much more reasonably priced 5 star restaurants nearby 
public areas are good 
hatten has a very nice pool 
that 's a lot of cash for a buffet and then charge you for coffee 
a very good 5 star option if one has business in and around the area where the hotel is located 
as soon as i entered the room a very strong smell of damp making it very unpleasant 
i recommend other steigenber hotel nearby the airport if you stay one night only 
and the front desk and staff were not helpful at all 
the afternoon tea in the club room lounge was overcrowded and we were unable to get a seat for 
all with ample warm lighting 
deep bath 
i guess higher floors 
the public car park is about 5 mins walking distance and very convenient 
i spent 3 nights in this great hotel 
for those that want easy access to the city centre 
the facilities are nice and the breakfast is good 
the room was well sized with a huge chandelier 
the shower was very small and tough to turn around in 
the front desk ordered a taxi for our ride back to the train station and the taxi showed up very 
efficient and well positioned property for a short stay for the proficient business traveller 
we stayed to attend a wedding and as a birthday celebration so the ability to check in early to our 
no fuss and traditional corparte hotel with all the services and ammentities you would expect 
the staffs dedication to service may the stay memorable . 
so best dress for the gym in your room to save the hike 
they are however very well appointed but as a frequent intercon guests you would expect larger rooms 
room was good size and as expected 
you pretty much ca n't walk from your room to hotel reception 
i think the room looked out over a very quiet street 
first of all the hotel is perfectly located 
great hotel for a central location in perth to do business 
i could open the window but then you get the traffic noise starting at 6am 
the sauna and the steam room are nice 
choose a room near to reception if you dont want to walk - otherwise choose a far away room 
good value and great for those traveling with friends or young children 
overall a great experience and good value for money 
the hotel staff were pleasant and helpful 
we found it difficult to find restaurants close to the hyatt to dine in - actually we found 
we were in a regency club room so had access to the club lounge for breakfast and early evening 
as there are many small cafes and restaurants within walking distance 
this is a brand new hotel with nice decor 
999 of us take showers and old-style european u-bottomed bathtubs are 
the hotel has several buildings and most rooms are renovated 
it is situated in a semi pedestrianised area with a good choice of bars 
it 's a short walk to the bund as well 
a large conference which ran to perfection 
some gentlemen might appreciate this kind of additional options 
2 nights at the african pride hotel melrose arch it 's not my first stay and my 
two single bed join together 
rooms are not very big and spacious 
walking to anything you need to get to 
though found the low level lighting to be a little frustrating when we wanted to read - in the bathroom 
the lobby is really nice 
but was pleasently suprised with the large rich interiors of the room 
the views from the rooftop were amazing and well worth waking up early to catch the sunrise 
this is an exceptional property and one of the better hotels in holland 
brand new staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the location is just spot on 
there is a small pool and bar at the top of the hotel with great views of rio 
it is great value and sets you up for a day in amsterdam 
clean hotel 
but more than enough and high level quality esp 
very nice doubletree located near central station and an easy walk to main parts of amsterdam 
perfect for a trip with your sisters or girlfriends 
small shops massage and local vendors 
you can go and return to the acropolis area easily several times per day if you want 
short walk to metro and bund 
but the room was small and not very comfortable 
and clearly the fan in the shower had n't been cleaned for awhile either 
a nice quiet area with a view into the bushland 
the restaurants are very good and while the breakfast is a little pricey it also was delicious 
we struck an extraordinarily arrogant young german woman on reception whose rudeness will long linger in our memory 
there was an issue with our bill but the front desk fixed it quickly 
i could n't stay in the resort and the only redeeming aspect is when i spoke with the 
this also meant that the tv channels were delivered via the imac internet and quite often the picture audio 
a standard w property - with the safety and security that sadly is needed in mexico city 
i certainly would not recommend the hotel for older guests though who may be looking for a quiet hotel 
they gave us the room next door 
hotel is within walking distance ( but you can do better ) from pubs 
great cocktails 
staff were very friendly and rooms were great size and had a hammock overlooking the city which was great 
wireless internet is not free if you get on their website and have someone on their sales team call 
the shower would n't drain and the door lock would n't work - almost missed my flight 
but colleagues on some lower floors complained about street noise 
very good service 
service unfortunately was slow and our empty plates were never taken nor could we order hot drinks 
the location is perfect 
it helped me to pick up stuff for my family . 
but above the headboard - you 're not going to look at it there 
warm welcome ( plus cookie ) and nicely appointed room ( a little small by us and middle asian 
especially the views form the top level sky lounge bar are good for a drink or two 
the wooden floors and oriental rugs are a nice touch 
choose a room as high up as possible 
nice shower a good touch was the apple tv in room with free wi fi 
the breakfast buffet was good but not exceptional 
fresh fruit and complimentary drinks 
we ordered 4 different dishes off the menu all were out of stock of the ingredients 
stockholm has better options than this 
good wifi and business facilities ( to enable printing out of boarding passes and the like ) 
you do n't get anything special with a raddison hotel but it all works just as it 
much better to use the nice beach 
anything ocean front above the 3rd floor is great 
make sure you get up to the sky lounge and roof top bar for the sunset 
i went to the front desk 
after a long flight in 
the hotel has a nice lobby and bar however the rooms are just adequate 
starbucks and full store on property 
soft drinks at the bar 4 
hotel and resort are fantastic 
great restaurants and spa and really helpful and friendly staff 
our room was ready after lunch and we were taken by jeep to our room with the bags coming 
the room was clean and the bed was comfortable 
the large property absorbed the noise of the child guests well 
remains a beautiful resort 
my new favorite hotel 
air con was efficient and the thin duvet seemed a pointless addition 
ideal business hotel for one-two nights 
staff were friendly and the food fantastic 
they even offered to walk me to the dentist so that i would not get lost and then check up 
very pricey 
the bed was comfortable and the room was clean 
classic hotel lobby and a proper key and fob 
the property is beautiful with nice landscaping 
the bedroom was along the corridor and there was a dated but large bathroom with separate bath and shower and 
before rushing to the amazing beaches of other islands in polinesya 
once again service was exceptional 
and mine was very spacious with great shower 
my repeated requests to the front desk staff to not put infants in the adjoining room fell on deaf ears 
it literally is about a 5 minute drive to airport and if you have an early flight 
this is considered a reasonable value for tahiti 
free wifi was strong 
free parking is a big plus for this area 
it has a nice beach entrance with lovely sand 
and friendly staff 
for an overnight layover 
they have a strange round bar table like reception desk which gets quite cluttered when there are a lot 
this hotel has been built into a side of the midi station shopping mall so that one can exit 
the chinese restaurant is also pretty good and the breakfast buffet is elaborate 
my room was ready and clean 
very accomodatingfacilities are fantastic including kids club and the pool 
the breakfast spread is a fusion of balinese and traditional breakfast fares ( i frequented the japan 
there are no words to describe the excellent buffet breakfast 
the bathroom is compact but had a good hot shower of a decent size 
stay was good value-for-money and convenient 
it was a tiring day and we went to wynn to watch the fountain and volcano 
this hotel is a step above a backpacker hostel 
the amenities are really good 
we had nice fluffy pancakes and i had a lovely scrambled eggs and bacon 
staying in town on the way back through at the 5 star pullman ( with breakfast ) for 
of course the new york bar is a must see 
food and drinks were great 
a great gym and pool 
the staff was rude and the bed was abominable 
they tell me breakfast is included -- as i have book a club room i ask why 
food very good and helpful staff 
our room was good - large 
the decor and tasteful furnishings 
the rooms are good sized and the beds was comfortable but the air conditioning sounded like a jumbo jet 
the service was good but not great 
might be worth the cost 
the staff are very friendly but service needs to be improved 
everything was excellent this time and they certainly made up for the previous visit 
but our return for a last night stopover as well 
the walk in shower very nice 
the italian restaurant was very good 
nice bar 
love how quiet the room was 
innovative and the food beautifully presented 
first time being in tokyo and i was really hppy that my father and i wanted 
the food experience was outstanding - the degustation dinner 
this hotel continues to offer very high service levels and amenities at a reasonable rate 
the super comfy beds 
room was quite large with a big bathroom and separate shower 
convenient and great value if you do business in beijing 
i have stayed in similar priced hotel 
reasonably nice accomodation in cairns city 
telling the front desk that i would check out early in the morning and i need a taxi 
actually this is a great hotel with nice room and facilities 
great service 
perhaps it 's some distance from the main attractions 
the cold buffet included pastries 
they have a wonderfull buffet for breakfast and a huge lobby 
beds that you dream of bringing back home 
the hotel lobby 
we would recommend eating across the rad as the quality of food and service is better at the salmon bake 
do n't expect to get free breakfast if you book using points 
unless you really do want to smoke in your room 
about the great bedding 
there are far better areas to be in 
they kept me waiting in the lobby with no one even apologising about it 
i would say this is one of the best hotels i have stayed at 
restaurants etc ) where you can buy some of the best souvenirs at very reasonable prices ( 
a fabulous high tech toilet 
the welcome by will was great the tour very helpful 
this is one of the best breakfasts we 've had in a hotel for choice and quality 
you will find their aluminum floored pool which ranges from 4feet to 5 feet in the center 
the main building will make you feel like you are in castle 
there are many shops and small local restaurants within walking distance 
the rooms are 100 luxury and comes with a very nice and big marble bathroom with television next to the 
the coffee was lukewarm while the espresso machine did n't have skim milk as option 
complete decor left me with feeling of regret 
efficient elevators 
got a great corner room with very nice view 
asked for a high floor room and was allocated 22nd floor with a city view 
they immediately upgraded me to a nice room on a high floor and was eager to give me all the 
i called the front desk and asked whether i could attend his function and they were only to willing to 
the only two good things here were the service and the luxury room 
lots of thoughtful touches 
the lobby bar is also great 
the bathrooms are large 
30 odd minutes from the airport and the city centre 
concierge lounge offers excellent breakfast fare and has a spread better than all us domestic marriott 
the room is big and services are superb 
separate huge tvs in the living room and bedroom with a good variety of channels 
there does n't appear to be a self parking option-- unless you park in the office building that 
the airport is about 30 mins from the hotel by taxi 
hotel was central to town and shops nearby 
we were hardly in the hotel anyway 
the shower was a dream with a super large ceiling shower head 
i can only recommend the club level as the amenities and extras are fantastic 
most notiable is that they also had a free breakfast with hot and cold stuffs 
only stayed one night on business 
same with the lifts 
pool area basic but a good size 
good quality 
there 's no damp smell like some qld nt hotels 
really nice renovation 
room service menu is limited 
modern and stylish hotel 
the large and high-ceilinged open plan reception bar area was very welcoming and comfortable 
my room was average sized and nice and bright too 
good checkin and friendly doorman 
i wish on taj club floor these things should be looked at before a guest checks in 
except slightly updated with new carpet 
the bathroom is very spacious too with 2 wash up area 
would recommend at the right price 
so overall- ok for a business trip ( i was there for a wedding and business trip ) - 
that 's because there is n't a perfect business hotel in glasgow ( or at least 
it is very well maintained and is a perfect place of luxury 
coffee and chocolate drinks supplemented by complimentary nibbles 
but their definition of an upgrade is a higher floor 
yes there was a choice but what was there is not what you expect in a high rating hotel 
we 'd have to give corinthia a pass if we every came back to the city 
i am assigned a lower floor 
received a small upgrade with hilton diamond membership 
nice little bar on the ground floor which we visited on our first evening ( drinks not cheap but this 
albeit small and the bathroom very small the size of a closet 
my room was lovely it had a small lounge area which was nice and the bed was very comfortable 
the pool is open until 11 p 
then cross the lobby to get to the elevator bank that takes you to your room 
most common areas are nice enough but the front entrance is tawdry and really needs some attention to 
i wish there was a grocery store nearby 
bellman is great and gives more helpful tips 
liked the spacious public areas 
internet is free only in the lobby area and if you have to use internet in your room 
good airport hotel 
room is nicely design and decent size 
the rooms are clean with a modern decor 
a really nice size with a nice size bathroom which of course was spotless 
we where about 20 min from the airport so a good alternative to yas island 
nice modern cozy airport hotel 
nice gym 
there is an attended gym adjacent to the pool area 
amenities were all good and the room was a good standard 
there are many information panels and interesting photos in the lobby detailing the hotel 's fascinating history 
choose a room facing the internal courtyard if you are a light sleeper like me 
i requested a low floor as there 's a balcony in the suite 
lunch round the pool we had to wait for tables to be cleared from used crockery etc 
a nearby small shopping mall ( viva 
not sure what we should really use the second bedroom for as we were only 2 persons 
but a lad of about 12 was in the pool on one occassion so not sure if they have 
this new resort is in a great location 
stayed 5 nights in a wonderful suite during the formel 1 race in july 2014 
the hotel is an old property 
there 's a brt ( bus rapid transit ) station right opposite from the hotel 
the dinner -food included was very disappointing- so if you have a special occasion choose one of the 
the floors looks old and the overall building looks like it needs refurbishment 
with attached kitchenette and sofa area 
higher floors are better and tower 2 has easiest access to roof 
during one of the breaks they served fresh juice--everyone picked the fruit veggies they wanted and the young 
the rear rooms ( not on herrengasse ) are very quiet for light sleepers 
very busy phone line ( 5 min wait to get reception to answer your call each and every time ) 
the bed was lovely and comfortable 
comfy beds and good amenities 
noted bit of weird drainage smell in the bathroom 
we stayed mid week and booked a 2 bedroom spa apartment 
but service variable and room service is not available to the apartments 
the gym is tiny for such a huge complex and again overcrowded 
the hotel is one of those boutique ones you either love or hate 
with eclectic individual features and fast free wifi 
monster kitchen and bar for dinner lunch ( not so great for little kids ) 
although is open only to guests with such huge hotel it is tiring crowded with family and kids of 
understated old world class . 
and the front desk reassured me that they prepared a crib for the baby 
however the counter service is average and the view from the room is the only thing that 's 
really enjoyed the fresh fish options at dinner 
we stayed at the suite and the room is fabulous and amazing 
amazing bathroom 
the public spaces are very fine 
so it was otherwise a good value 
excellent location and view excellent location for conferences , with an awesome view . 
all the dishes tasted really great -- i especially loved the scone and the desserts 
the rooftop swimming pool is really to die for 
amzaing peace just outside of the city 
we assumed incorrectly that it would be located on the beach 
we booked lux package which included a free bottle of champagne and one free chocolate bar for two at the 
cigarette butts decorate the flower beds of your balcony 
included is a complimentary cocktail in the lounge area for each guest 
the beach club portion is completely separate from the main resort 
very busy and well located but it is still easy to manage and has all the access one needs for 
even though is it located at the busy dago street 
only on 2nd day they give us better towels 
lobby was decorated nicely 
staff at restaurants and room service is very good 
pool area was good 
the facilities are family friendly with the horse ride on the weekend although the water in the swimming pool was 
came back to this hotel after 10 years ago-as i read they 've done some renovations 
my last gripe was with the sky park set up 
but hotel is huge 
they have a complimentary airport shuttle that picks you up from the terminal 
the front desk staff william and adil for remembering us and ensuring we had a good stay 
room service lunch of special fried rice was tasty and enjoyable 
there 's a huge sitting area and writing desk 
large and have high ceilings and some very good views 
occasionally a peacock or 2 will walk past you 
had a dead cockroach in the outdoor bath 
the roof top infinity pool is fantastic but just way too crowded for my liking 
dinner are excellent 
because eventually we did have a lovely stay and the property is undoubtedly beautiful in terms of scenery and architecture 
high floor is a must 
only 3 mins walk and the port for the river boat is just nearby too 
good local restaurants nearby 
the location is great within a short stroll of the eiffel tower and accessible to many great cafes 
the bathroom and toilet were separate and that made the room seem even smaller 
the bathroom was huge and had a variety of amenties from a sewing kit to a nail file 
with a big shower 
we usually stay near the eiffel tower so for us the location was perfect 
it was my first trip to paris 
you then get free high speed internet in the hotel and discounts at various restaurants 
i was stranded an extra day waiting for my luggage and they did their best for me 
the hotel staff is great and would help you getting around bangkok 
check-in and check-out were quick and effortless and the service was efficient and friendly 
the 29 bus leave outside every 30 minutes even on a saturday and is about 20 minutes into what 
being walking distance to the christchurch airport is ideally suited for transit - and with long term parking facilities 
i also appreciated the extra security that they have implemented when one gets to avail of the infinity pool and 
they have a free shuttle to and from the airport which is close 
i like the bathroom with big bathtub 
not sure if the extra premium is good value for money 
it is recommended hotel for those who looking for quality room at excellent value 
despite the current refurb 
with direct access to the rest of the city via the metro 
right on marina bay with downtown close by and with it 's own footbridge to gardens by 
room was good size and the great hotel location let your sample singapore food 
the pool on the roof was amazing - though it was a bit cold 
they also go out of their way to research tours for you and book them too 
the hotel is clean and well presented 
the view was perfect and the pool was the best i have seen so far 
tour buses run frequently from the plaza in front of the station ( actually one right next to the 
so i wanted to get to the airport quickly in the morning 
nice indoor swimming pool 
especially after a long haul international flight 
good hotel convenient for the airport 
the famous and stunning looking infinity pool on the 57th floor has fabulous views but be prepared for the 
we stayed at this hotel for only 1 night 
dark stains on walls 
the hotel staff were really friendly and the room was extremely clean 
worth staying a night to swim 57 floors above the bustling city 
bathroom was huge with a large tub with a separate shower area all in a wet space 
it 's very hard to say anything about the excelsior hotel gallia other than to say 
the restaurants were good 
as the lowest price hotel within resort world group 
i think the hotel is meeting expectation 
it 's a 20-minute walk to old town areas 
the hotels own bakery and cake shop 
busy area to get there 
swimming pool and sauna it 's perfect to relax after a long working day 
the food was superb and that view from the infinity pool at the top was breathtaking 
it has all the typical business amenities you would expect 
there is no concierge and the check in process is automated ( there is a counter if you 
the bar was very nice but 50 
more vegas or dubai style but still fun as many other people pointed out , this hotel is 
hotel staff are nice but not really helpful on giving advise on where to go or eat 
other facilities at the hotel included an extensively equipped gym and pool spa area which were both of a high 
cleaniness is top notch 
the furnature was chipped and broken and my sheet even had a hole in it 
so do n't expect good service or amenities like other hotels 
the wifi worked well and parking is possible in front of the hotel on sundays without payment 
5 minute walk from a subway station-there is actually a supermarket in an arcade across from the hotel 
the staff is also relentlessly cold 
i was there on a conference and the company booked the hotel 
you 'll only go for the huge infinity pool 
you will also find lots of restaurants in the close proximity 
the concierge is really helpful 
the views from the gym is probably one of the best ever 
pool makes it worth the stay 
but since we got a free upgrade to a suite on the 5th floor 
he upgraded both our rooms ( sil had a paid room ) from deluxe to premium and i believe 
for the same cost 
there is a very good pool 
the staff was very attentive and the breakfasts were terrific 
we were next to a small shopping mall which had a supermarket and retail outlets 
incredibly dated with rickety small beds which had awful mattresses that i do n't think 
defenitely one of the best hotels i ever stayed in 
you can hear the doors slamming from the room next to you 
sometimes it 's a bit annoying being on the bottom half to access the roof pool as you have 
expected more from expensive staycation 
fantastic gym and breakfast with all fresh juices 
whilst the bathroom was huge 
you can not open the window anyway 
we will certainly be staying here again next time we come to singapore 
the service is excellent 
very comfortable bed and great gym and small but perfectly formed swimming pool 
later a number of more shortcomings were encountered with house keeping which all of them alone were not really worth 
it 's about a 15 minute walk into the old town . 
service was good and efficient 
quiet and overall a beautiful property 
we were on the 31st floor and the view was spectacular 
as i made a very last minute booking i thought the value was very good 
we got the stay 3 pay for two deal and this turned out to be a super value and great 
i think the stables would be the best . 
this was a comfortable hotel in a good location in launceston 
lovely hotels with lovely staffs 
but i am used to free internet and at least a bath in the room when paying 200 for a 
i stayed here for two nights and barely left the rooftop pool or the hotel 
i was concerned that the lively activities in the public areas--a major charity event i believe--would 
need to walk to tower 1 where it linked to the shoppes at marina bay sands where 
there is a line for almost anything although automated express check out was quick and hassle free 
higher up rooms are best 
the city view is great - but it is a big hotel so expect to be just another face coming 
old worn carpets 
my only confusion was the opaque glass wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom 
throughout our stay were helpful 
i was upgraded to a superior room instead of my booking a standard room 
the lobby is spacious 
in which case the starbucks across the street is a better proposition 
it is a little more expensive , but well worth it . 
the front desk and concierge also made a point to acknowledge the problem and offer redress 
great view over the bay ( or the sea of you choose the other side ) comfortable bed and you 
so i spend many nights in hotels from the simplest to very nice 
the swimming pool on sky park is memorable with a long infinite-edge pool overlooking tops of other buildings 
ask for a high floor 
this is probably one of the best hotels in town 
one of the top global hotels with an iconic design 
the area is great- one of the best turkish neighborhoods free from tourists but just a short walk 
breakfast spread is great and it 's more like staying in your own ( nice ) apartment 
awful service - come for the casino and the pool 
you could hear no noise whatsoever either internally or externally so i enjoyed a great nights sleep 
fruit or pastries - a nice touch 
but who needs a swimming pool when you have a wonderful beach right in front of the hotel 
the hotel is clean and well kept 
the hotel did n't provide any extra amenities due to this inconvenience or post warning about this on h 
warmly welcomed by the staff who spent the entire time ensuring our stay was pleasant 
the gymnasium is awful however and the pool area and the lobby could be more impressive 
at the outset we requested for the gym to be opened earlier as i needed to catch an early flight 
hotel staffs are very friendly and have very good knowledges about city and transportation 
the hotel was easy enough to find after following the signs for the train station and the hotel is right 
the bathroom had thon toiletries and good shower pressure 
checking in or doing anything involves a slow queue 
the bed was a little hard for my liking though but the bathroom was really modern and the shower was 
the executive lounge on the top floor was excellent with a good choice of tasty and fresh bites in the 
very comfortable room overall 
impressed by something new at each of my visits . 
very disappointing stay 
it was supposed to be a quiet floor was the first response 
the spa looked great but we had no time to enjoy it 
coffee and fresh juices are available while you wait your turn 
it was cold and windy and although we paid full price for our room ( not discounted through the 
and could n't have asked for a better place to relax in between two long haul flights 
a criticism i have is the poor quality shower which resembled a water tap and the lack of a shower 
service is what you would expect from this type of hotel and the large restaurant serves a good meal 
comfortable bed and nice sheets 
the wishing tree mick 's tower walk leads down to a gully crossed by a suspension bridge 
frankfurt airport is the biggest and busiest in germany - all you want is to reach 
not cheap but great value for money 
i was using the hotel 's pool and i wanted to access the public skypark 
( took my partner here as part of his birthday ! 
great location - it is connected to the mbs mall where you can spend 2 full days as it 
especially after a long haul flight 
you could do an express checkout if you did n't want to check your bill 
it is great for a business meeting 
lucy at the ma tre d desk was lovely and was calm under pressure 
the hotel is nice with beautiful views and a great restaurant 
there are other hotels of more recent construction on the beachfront at hermanus but none offer the 
this hotel is amazing 
located close to the financial district 
the restaurants provided excellent food 
go for the luxury double room with sea view 
if it wasnt for the gimmick pool or casino i doubt this place would have one customer 
somewhat dated with the only shower being over the bath 
but it will be quiet it you get one with double windows like mine had 
television size is big 
a real let-down from the last airport hilton we stayed at 
my husband found the bag sitting on the floor in lobby one 
complimentary pastries and hot coffee available in the lounge 
there is an easy shuttle bus that runs every 30 minutes 
i always prefer double sinks 
very close o the airport fast train railway stationthe rooms are sound proofed perfectly 
a city view on a floor above 30 
no free water in room 
but for my next visit i would try a different hotel 
first time in this hotel because a long stopover in frankfurt and i have to say that was 
food selection is however considered little as compared to other comparable hotels in sg or malaysia 
as it is of the same group the property is also exclusive 
the best part of the hotel for me was the pool which was uber cool with the best views in 
the staff are generally well informed and very helpful taking care that all guests are looked after by ensuring for 
when they should be available to the guests 
massive rooms 
finally would be nice to have some more english tv channels - the only ones available were news channels 
also i am not sure how achille & pier giacomo castiglioni will feel 
i had a nice view and small balcony out the rear of the hotel but the bed 
the lobby is grandiose 
i was greeted by friendly staff with excellent command of the english language 
the infinity pool is the main attraction on the top floor and it 's amazing 
quickly relocated me to the main building where there is a lift 
i stayed at this hotel along with a tourism industrry delegation of 100 from australia in 
very old stairs were very dirty in appearance 
the airconditioning is always a problem ( we stayed now the third time there ) 
and the odd drink snack 
but the rooms are rather small and the carpet is worn in alot of the areas 
could be a great property again as nicely located 
the ongoing renovations did not detract from our experience in the least 
a rip-off in all hotels if not free 
overall it was an excellent trip and the value for money ( early september ) was amazing 
there is an open carpark next to the hotel - there is a parking fee for hotel guests 
the bar area had battered chairs and the room furniture had seen better days 
with a nice sofa area and plenty of natural sunlight bathing the beautiful room 
skypark - is really quite cool and the pool is amazing 
the shopping centre connected to the convention centre has some good restaurants - would recommend the italian with a 
so sitting out became a case of dragging the desk chair outside ( not very 5 star ) the 55 
with a modern interior 
fabulous bar 
it is a pleasant park with pretty botanical gardens therefore a nice walk 
it provided very comfortable accommodation in a great position just off the town centre and opposite the spa and the 
the staff really have the home away from home feel to an artthe hotel itself is very quaint 
very basic amenities only 
the 01 09 suites back on to a busy road and the sound-proofing against traffic noise was 
perfect stay in a great london spot 
bar and the restaurant 
as well as surcharges of 2 for using mastercard and a 10 day internet charge for 
-no complimentary in room water apart from a bottle that is provided at turndown serviceits a 
awesome spa and good sized indoor pool 
it has a beautiful setting 
the hotel has recently been refurbished and has great character 
the hotel design is amazing 
2x free 500ml mineral water 
the check in process was smooth and the staff very nice and helpful 
very nice business hotel 
the buffet breakfast was excellent 
actually there are lots of restaurants nearby 
the front desk and bell staff were very good and thier communication skills in english were excellent 
also conciergue area very good with the information of the area 
and easy access for taxis 
very nice hotel 
incredibly fast elevators 
nice location next to clark quay 
expected to have our room organized already as i sent an email to the hotel prior to our arrival 
but not so nice pool 
great fluffy towels 
one point to improve is erratic wifi 
chic or hip 
if you are a wifi addict the signal is awful 
on the downside drawer storage and wardrobe space was very limited and there was no shaver point in the 
rooms are reasonably good size and well maintained 
great gym 
the staff are friendly and the food is good 
so from the room the noise of constant traffic passing by can easily be heard 
have stayed here before and find the location particularly convenient to both the cbd for work and darling harbour 
breakfast was excellent with freshly squeezed orange juices and freshly baked pastries 
it is next to cargo bar and nightclub and friday and saturday nights do get a bit m 
great location great service hotel renovation ok food quality poor 
friendly receptionists 
in comparison to better hotels 
i look forward to my next trip to taipei 
overall the property absolutely met our expectations with impeccably clean 
it was much better than me just running on the street for exercise - and in general the kind of 
suites on the ground floor open directly onto the pool which is handy for children 
the gym and pool are lovely 
a couple of small negatives 
the beach is fantastic and quite private even if the resort was almost full you do n't feel it 
this time we have tried several restaurants 
we spent a lot of time at their beautiful beach and pool area 
in a quiet space ) 
its big resort 
it took some doing but he managed to sort out adjoining rooms for me 
this resort is actually three hotels near each other 
opposite the hotel is a small shopping mall and many eateries along the river located just 10 min 
a few days later i unexpectedly received a personal email from the general manger inviting me back free of 
we were given a kids room special rate 
it is a short walk to many key paris attractions such as the louvre 
the lounge was bigger than the king bedroom whilst the bathroom with huge tub 
there are several restaurants in the resort which convince you to stay in side the resort and avoid the city 
good food and spa treatments 
location is good and concierge is very enthusiastic 
every member of the staff was courteous and helpful , and we walked to shops , museums 
breakfast is downstairs from the main lobby 
since its a massive property 
quality of food is also good 
service was great as well and continental breakfast had probably the best selection i 've seen in india 
pool with slide is great for kids and rooms are very well appointed 
) we were greeted by some of the nicest hotel staff i 've ever encountered ( and trust 
lovely food and beautiful views 
bar - good ambience and very well stocked 
the rooms were also very spick and span 
the beach is beautiful and relaxed 
fabulous food - i put on weight - served at two fabulous restaurants - one on a roof terr 
this marriott is a good choice if you are looking for something close to the airport or with large 
there are sea planes right on the banks of the lake next to the property 
thoroughly recommend this hotel if you need an oasis from the chaos that is calcutta 
located in the heart of the city a great place to stay 
this is one of the hotels that you should consider staying 
at all levels to do anything to make and keep customers happy 
staff friendly helpful and checkin-out were smooth 
breakfast was ok not a great foyer area 
the hotel is a slice of history 
affordable and you can go around with basic facilities on hand 
next to airport and close enough to town 
the selection of hot and cold snacks are varied and very tasty 
fresh juices 
they are short walking distance 
the room is so old style grand 
was good sized and very clean 
other brickbat was that wine by the glass had a limited choice and was about 25 for a 130 
gym was adequate and wifi was strong but was charged extra 
smoking rooms are on low floors so watch out for szr location if you need quiet and smoke 
the 1 bedroom suite was large 
i had booked a room for my son and his bride for a couple of nights after the wedding and 
they would while walking the corridors make sure your well being is asked and you made comfortable within its precincts 
i first visited here in early 2000 and i felt i stayed in stayed room 
the pickup from the airport was prompt and the hotel upgraded me to a bigger 
we drove back to the airport with a hotel car at midnight and it took us 45 minutes 
i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in late january for a mid-winter getaway to 
big lobby with a lake 
the pool is wonderful and there is a good workout facility 
we ate our meals at the hotel and service in restaurants was good 
nice spa 
however they offer a spare one by the door wardrobe area 
even more fantastic breakfast 
then escape to the wonderful oasis of the oberioi 
the lobby feels like it is stil in the 70 's around the time it was built 
the room was super clean and the staff very pleasant 
rooms are small so it 's going to be a squeeze if you have large luggage with you but 
a 130 year old property and well kept 
one of the nicer airport options 
big bottles of complimentary water everyday 
just outside of the airport 
as well as location including one or two outside cafes restaurants right accross s figueroa street 
central la downtown 
a lovely pool area to sit by 
private beach 
bath was glorious . 
the breakfast was ok 
i especially loved the small stairs between the main room and the small study sofa arealobby is beautiful 
very nice room which was spaciousour bed-sheet was torn when they put it on and they did 
still has smoking rooms so if you are not smoking make to request a non smoking room 
the food is amazing 
this was my 1st exp in this grand resort 
every one gets late check out 3pm at check out we had to wait in queue as every one 
lovely old-school hospitality 
not an unpleasant walk though 
the menu for breakfast was much great as well 
the rooms are comfortable with great mattresses and you ca n't beat the doubletree cookies 
i will not stay here again unless its a last resort booking 
although there was nice water pressure and the bath amenities included big-brand toothpaste and mouthwash 
it 's got plenty of restaurants to cater for all tastes 
the rooms are decent and if you have lounge access that is a bonus 
you hear the ceo of tropicana talk about the great customer service you will receive from the 
you might be able to find a comparable price in a larger hotel 
i played a few of the video slot machines in the main tower 's casino 
in the club tower they have been refurbed and there is no noise and are generally much much better 
the mgm definitely has the coolest pool in las vegas 
the room itself was lovely - all in a miami 1950s style 
located on the southern side of the strip close to new york new york and the exc 
get 2 free buffets which is good 
the biggest issue i found was that the elevators were super slow 
it really had everything you could think of and all the items have good quality about them 
saw these guys on america 's got talent . 
the seperate bedroom was also huge with a nice comfy king sized bed & also a large spacious 
no outside space open to lounge in the 77 heat and sunshine 
decent desk and reliable wifi 
the room ( 1428 in the tower closest to the lobby ) was clean and the beds were comfortable 
also on the main level of the manor house is a small bar room 
the hotel exceeded every expectation from organising the very best room 
just stayed here again and the wifi is now free for all 
the room in the club tower was very large and clean 
but there are other bars you can go to 
a stylish yet simple lobby 
the restaurants like the thai pavilion was great and latitude coffee all day dining 
rahul and of course rita were absolutely superb and we left extremely happy with our stay at 
highly recommend higher floor room with executive launge access and superior river view 
room size is decent and bed comfortable 
clean modern bathroom with excellent shower and generous toiletries 
huge luxurious rooms as well as rooms for business meetings exist 
the basic internet was very slow 
specious comfortable - great shower 
i arrived at the hotel from the airport late in the evening and could not get anything to eat in 
i stayed at this property during my last visit to frankfurt 
soda and a beer ) all rooms are the same 
there are also vending machines downstairs if you want to have a drink in your room 
the room was spacious and comfortable 
a couple of annoyances were some noise due to a party and an overflowing bin with a pile of 
this one is good value for what you pay - super clean 
what a view to wake up to ( and go to sleep to for that matter - city lights on 
good times with a view to burn and at a good value 
check out was hassle free 
especially during the morning rush-hour when the trains arrive at the airport from the southern suburbs already packed 
i had a club room with the right to use the club lounge 
it was a little cold in the mornings 
the food beautiful and the staff cannot do enough for you 
no real noise complaints for the area and generally great value 
our room and balcony were overlooked by a huge block of apartments only a few metres away requiring us to 
and for the reasonable price and great views 
good bathroom and a sizeable shower with good water pressure 
the location is good but be aware that it is uphill from public transport so less appropriate if you have 
we are seasoned business travellers both in nz and asia and europe 
it is an old building 
good bed and bathroom 
the pool was awesome and the staff were friendly 
really friendly and efficient reception staff but as all rooms are named rather than numbered you need to listen well 
so in the bedroom is like being under a herd of wildebeests 
the prices are much too high and breakfast was pathetic - i love hilton breakfasts around the 
the shower area is also difficult to use because the shower head is high up 
the room was obviously brand new but we did n't like the easy access to the public car park 
we had a casual dinner in the bar the evening before the wedding 
service excellent and the rooms up to scratch with the hilton brand 
it was perfect for what we wanted and although in itself not in a particularly special location its facilities 
the rooms are tiny and you can hear next door cough 
everything at this hotel was five star quality from the moment we arrived and were greeted by the friendliest 
a lovely boutique hotel in a great neighbourhood 
fine for business . 
most modern hotels in india today provide electrical outlets that accept any type of plug 
i predict it will be a memorable stay 
the supply of toiletries was fully replenished every day as were the tea and coffee - room service 
club floor services good 
it was a genuine suite with a bedroom and separate sitting dining working room 
there did n't seem to be any vending machines available on property that i saw 
the drop off at the domestic airport was pleasant 
the property is a big sprawling so it 's hard to find your way around the reception areas 
bar great 
i was given a complimentary upgrade to one of their suites 
we stayed one night on 27 january and had a nice large room with good amenities and comfortable bed 
furnished in the old art deco style with modern touches like a flat screen tv which you 
decent choices at breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet was good as well 
i had the pleasure of staying one night at the heritage last week when in auckland for business 
excellent - great service 
the design of the lobby is very interesting ( even if you do n't sleep in the lobby 
the bed is comfortable and the air-conditioning works 
the business center allows for free printing of airline boarding passes since online check-in is pretty common place 
stayed at a premium deluxe water villa 
despite recent renovations to the room 
nice comfortable and good value 
there is nearby parking 
it was a memorable day visit 
hot options 
very convenient location and good operator 
very safe area to walk 
i did n't stay long enough to check whether internet access incurs additional charges 
the main station is also just a few minutes away 
i specifically requested they charge me in indian rupees on checkout instead of my home currency so 
small but functional room 
as far as hotel rooms go , it was another hotel room , nothing special but nothing bad either 
excellent hotel with decent rate that is walking distance from the heart of oslo 
the conveniently accessible trams that run on king street 
close to transportation and tourist attractions and able to walk around the city easily 
the atrium is nice 
mini bar 
we stayed 3 nights in total 
the newer rooms are small but cozy 
great restaurants and many unique stores 
very low ceiling 
circular quay is just on your doorstep and it is a short walk away from pitt street 
all the restaurants and the cocktail bar perfect the spa treatments were very good 
the decor of the lodge is very eclectic - think rough hewn beams and barn doors combined with z 
met by very efficient staff and landrover with refresher towels and water and then a 40 min 
the setting for this hotel is simply terrible and it probably attracts people who like the four season 's 
the outdoor shower was nice idea but during a windy day 
my beach villa was nice but the surrounded garden did n't let me watch directly the front beach 
the alternative is the bistro which serves more good quality food and at reasonable prices 
exec lounge was such good value and a great meeting point for business 
dinner was superb & the building is absolutely lovely 
the reception helpful 
we needed somewhere fairly central in montreal for a couple of nights and were pretty excited to have managed 
the club level receives free premium wifi 
were adequately sized ( not huge ) 
we had no problem at all getting around using public transportation or walking ( except taxis to and from the 
although the gym was incredible the spa area was one part of the hotel which really did look a little 
the free minibar was quite welcome after the hassles to get there 
and the front desk was apologetic 
the free internet worked most of the time 
and the grounds and outdoor hallways are generally pretty scummy in wet season 
it was quiet and dark ( there is fake window with lights behind it but you can turn those off 
no outdoor dining on the deck or by the pool at this old dear 
top notch currently enjoying the last of four nights here with my family and have been delighted with the location 
cocktail list in grain bar very good 
the mattress and the pillows are very comfortable 
bars and restaurants were really good 
the buffet at 40 a head is not cheap but it was very good value for money for us at 
noting that we had a special event menu rather than the general a la carte menu 
there are computers in the business center that are free to use 
did n't hear anything from the hotel for a full month 
stand to the right in the window and you get a fantastic side view of the bridge turn to your 
if you 're a silver member of le club accor you can have free internet ( but it 
but we were disappointed with the room allocated to us 
but this is expected in a historic building 
some very nice restaurants and a very classic decor throughout 
spacious room 
t be my first choice next visit 
and our bed was super-comfortable 
recently we were lucky enough to fulfill our promise and it well and truly lived up to expectations of 
modern decoration 
the big problem for now is the major street demolition immediately outside the front door ( for the installation of 
which let in ample light from the lake and the extensive fine gardens that surround the hotel 
tv and bed packed in 
there were loads of options of restaurants nearby and there was a coles about 15 minutes away 
the restaurants were all great and the food was of high class and breakfast was exceptional in terms of quality 
the breakfast buffet is busy on the weekend with a good selection 
the receptionist was very helpful and arranged for me to be phoned as soon as the room was 
hotel room was decent size for sydney standard offering floor to ceiling window to the syd 
next to mall great service and food 
beautiful roof top pool huge rooms and bathrooms and state of the art technology in the rooms will recommend 
i did spend an hour at the outside small pool 
the room service was so poor that after repeated calls they could not deliver basic stuff 
on arrival the lobby was impressive but when there were issues at the front desk on checking in 
the hotel manager assisted but it took over 2 
it 's located within the ambiance mall which has a good selection of shops and restaurants if you 
free wifi 
very helpful staff and after a little confusion over 1 of my rooms booking the front desk handled it swiftly 
just a 5 minute walk from harbour action is a massive plus in traffic-laden sydney and 
although the bathroom could use an update- fitness room is small but ok for light workout or if you 
the main lobby is small and uninviting 
the service was friendly and the location is great but the overall feel is a little dated and the house 
very good shower 
the rooms were very large and the layout was nice 
in other hand location is really a very good point 
you must know the italians know a lot about food and fashion but very little about hotels 
first the location is very convinante for almost every thing 
the location is good for walking to dining 
the upper floor is being renovated ( june 2014 ) - no particular noise 
very friendly staff 
the four seasons sydney is in a great location 
it is centrally located in downtown hamburg 
3 hot tubs at different temperatures and a heated wading pool 
quality and professional services rendered as extraordinary 
well in the lounge one evening we had to ask for napkins 
this hotel has the best location in sydney 
the rooms are quite spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous 
nicely decorated and great view 
the location is great and its right by the harbour bridge and the rocks area which is fabulous 
at the same price 
4 th floor are original spacious size 
the shower in the bath is a basic shower head and the water pressure was just average - no rain 
this is the best hotel in hamburg the staff the location the presence and ambiance is just magnificent 
however it means a 10 minute hike across the road ( over bridge ) through a shopping center and 
damp stains all over the ceiling and the walls 
i travel around the world at the best hotels having recently stayed at peninsula-tokyo 
rooms are well used but bed is great and that 's what it is all about 
and said go to the last floor and wash them yourself 
the hotel food was good but i felt like i had much better in other hotels ( and certainly at 
would recommend this place to anyone looking for a break from the strip to have a good english afternoon tea 
great shower and fast wifi 
with comfy chairs 
however mandarin offer a preferred-guest 4pm late checkout scheme 
the concierge was very helpful and genuinely seemed more interested in satisfying my interests rather than any arrangements 
one of the few nice hotels without a casino 
i would n't have waited longer in a mega hotel with the lines they have 
this is a clean modern facility on the yale campus 
i ordered room service several times and it was quick and good quality 
the location is perfect as you can easily walk everywhere which we did but the peace and quiet enabling you 
- hotel shuttle bus can take you to the shopping malls 
the entire hotel staff was delightful and welcoming 
the resort is good for kids 
the golden sands has been renovated so the public areas are completely new 
these were the gatun lake ( monkey island ) tour and the sunset safari 
executive suite is good for families 
nice pool and gym . 
the gamboa rainforest resort boasts a spectacular natural setting that mostly compensates for some annoying 
great bar 
rent a car to be flexible . 
public areas look as good as new 
car park is ample though you may have to park quite a distance away at a large central car park 
there are many opportunities to see and find out about sloths and take night tours ( all free ) 
there are many good restaurants in walking distance from the hotel and a taxi to the airport is about an 
great location and friendly staff make up for any shortcomings 
i also was given a double bed room 
if you ca n't make a decent breakfast croissant 
free internet from our room 
right next to shopping 
the internet is slow 
the gym is great with a lot of cardio equipment 
this was my first time staying in mandarin 
the beach right next to one of the three swimming pools is also beautiful and my kid enjoyed playing at 
however the quality is good 
my food complaint was addressed promptly with a phone call late one evening but that was it 
the staff were all very attentive and the resort was very well maintained considering the age of the property which 
comfortable accommodations 
it was very pricey but its ok 
the former was an overpriced tourist trap and the latter heaven 
this was am amazing if very expensive luxury treat 
the front desk suggested that i can keep my luggage in the previous room ready to be transferred so that 
its just a 5 mins short walk to central train station 
it may well be the best in town based on room quality 
european offices and airport hotel is good but lux is so small most are 
nice hotel clone to central station 
and short walk to the bus stop of city sightseeing sydney 
excellent hotel with top floor bar restaurant - nice location to have an afternoon coffee with great view over 
they added a small kitchen with full size fridge 
view of old city 
this is neither a ryokan nor a hotel but it charges like the former and provides but 
the shower was very large and very powerful 
the petrusse valley view rooms are worth the extra money 
breakfast is a good spread 
higher floor have mountain view 
the staff are so nice and accommodating 
our room on the 8th floor had a magnificent view of the marina and was very comfortable 
the hotel however is about 20 minutes walk to the nearest mrt ( nana ) 
bangkok is an incredibly hectic city 
the food and drinks prices are reasonably high although everything is good quality and comparable in cost to the rest 
well equipped gym allows fulfilling workout 
the room layout is a bit odd with toilet separate & inconvenient to sink & shower visible from bed - 
there are a couple of computers in the lobby with free internet access 
private beach 
full bar and all of it included in the cost of your room 
boasts and impressive beach which being in a closed bay operates effectively as a private beach that is only 
our daily free soft drinks for suites were not replenished daily 
the hotel was nice and despite being busy was calm and laid back style 
but i have to say that datai beach is the best beach in langkawi much better than 
i was staying in a one-bedroom suite 
check-in at the executive lounge is always smooth 
along with his lovely team 
it 's only open around lunch time 
almost all rooms are interconnecting so you can hear next doors tv and conversationsa disgrace to the 
serviettes from the tables when you went to get something else 
with a great lobby and helpful staff 
the swimming pool is always a big draw for me 
if your stay here its probably an idea to plan to eat elsewhere as your meals will easily outstrip 
as they tried to remedy the bad experience by giving me extremely late checkout and sending a bottle of sparkling 
then returning to airport and the next city south of it 
you are greeted by a spacious lobby which is refreshing after the heat and crowds of bangkok 
the bathrooms have separate tubs and showers 
i had my best upgrade experience as well since they upgraded me to the royal suite without any additional charges 
close to shops 
the pool area and beach are very nice but forget about getting a lounger around the pool as 
the beach is absolutely beautiful and well kept and there are mixed sports activities 
which is bordered by the rear of the main building and the pool area 
the bathroom was spacious but the shower door was not closing tight 
and it 's always nice to see the pool are n't as crowded or packed with families with 
my wife mentioned to me that the court was recently restored and the resurfacing was a dream to play 
and the hotel is a little far from kuah town but otherwise a great place for a get 
the resort is located right on the beach and has a lot to offer 
we promised to return to el meson the following night and were treated to some surprise off-the 
the bathroom was nice and large 
confirm that the driver will turn on the meter ( instead of charging you extra on a flat fee 
one of the better hotels in sukhumvit area 
add this into the room rate as you do with every other marriott i stay in 
the pool - excellent infinity pool with built-in benches to relax towards the view 
quick room service 
nice pool and sea view 
3 bathrooms 3 large lcd tvs 
concierge very helpful 
insert the key card at the entrance and the world came alive with clicking and lights 
the breakfast wait staff and the folks at valet parking 
great asian dishes and some maki sushi 
room is of good size and bathroom good 
always so much quicker than taxis 
we were the only people in the bar on a wet monday night and i can tell you why 
our suite was very spacious but the beds were old and uncomfortable 
good ambience 
the only funny thing was the hotel not crediting my frequent flier card- saying i did n 
i would say they are in between the chinese brand type hotel and the bigger major brandsso better 
friendly staff and good size rooms 
the front desk is slightly better 
a very nice radisson blu 
fast free wifi 
the view is superb . 
the elevators were relatively slow considering there are only 9 floors and acted up at times 
large bathroom and a good view of the river 
maybe there are larger business rooms available 
nicely renovated rooms with all the amenities incl 
check in quick and valet parking good 
seeing one in rubber slippers and the other one in near sleeveless attire 
the hyatt city of dreams in manila is located close to the airport and is a part of 
i had some papers to sign late at night and the reception staff could n't have been more helpful 
the bar area was nice and the staff prett good 
the reception is bright and airy and we were checked in quickly and given a room on the 10 
the old town is a short taxi ride away ( taxis are cheap in vilnius ) 
a big room with shower and bath tub 
the reception was most friendly and attentive 
staff are exceptionally friendly both on reception and the event staff 
great amenities 
but connected to a complex shopping mall 
the swimming pool is small but nice 
the hot tub was n't hot enough 
no other restaurants in the hotel but eventually you may use nobu hotel facilities and outlets 
the beds are very good ( firm yet comfortable ) and their is a pillow menu 
i had a room on the 9th floor with a great river view 
whatever you intended to do please keep the noise low 
the gym is very small with only three treadmills 
there are many good restaurants and cafes near the hotel and the staff at the hotel were more than willing 
but we felt it was good value for money 
a very quick walk into the the city 
good bed 
overall a very good base and value for exploring rome as well as excursions from rome 
front desk staff were very helpful 
i refuse to pay 24 euros for a limp club sandwich which has the smallest about of fillings possible 
had a good nights sleep 
my room was on 3rd floor and large and airy with a lovely modern bathroom 
we would not have chosen this hotel for our first trip to paris 
it seems a busy hotel for most french corporates in business area la defense and their guests 
the price is relatively reasonable compared to other hotels in a nicer areas even though they are only three stars 
i had free wifi due to my ihg membership 
with rooms of decent size 
travelling from here really requires a taxi and they can be scarce 
they have a huge swimming pool 
very odd location and difficult to find nearest provision shops and the nearest train station is 10-15 mins 
i was looking forward to stay in this glitzy ( from the outside ( night ) ) building 
very efficient shower 
the three elevators are quite slow during peak periods in the morning 
the location is good 
reading the review i feel like i stayed at a different hotel - or maybe they were just having a 
this hotel has a good breakfast for starting the day 
shampoo etc are lovely and the towels are thick and fluffy 
on a lower floor 
was there for 2 nights stay due to a function 
with all amenities one would expect 
very fine hotel 
the lobby is most impressive based on space and art 
the hotel provides a regular free shuttle service to major shopping malls to overcome its location and the tariff is 
slow elevator service is a problem 
i still ended up with single beds at level 7 
wait till you at the property where your room rate will be not honored and you end up paying more 
enjoyed the pool and they have a great kids pool as well 
i love old european hotels with their grand public spaces and their sense of history 
easy walk to times square 
bathrooms are spacious and clean 
the price was quite good 
the bed was very comfy 
efficient free internet all over the place 
the range of breakfast food was excellent and included both cooked and many cold items 
there is a good free breakfast in the morning but go early 
nice hotel with excellent customer service 
beer and coke free of charge which was a very nice touch ( although had to request a bottle 
also a stunning bar area 
there is a good gym and breakfast 
the rooms were clean and tidy 
the rooms are very high quality 
i felt bad about taking an extra shower during the day because the staff would feel obligated to dry it 
front desk was both helpful and friendly 
overall it was excellent value and i would stay there again 
but this did not bother me as i was staying on business and i prefer quiet hotels anyway 
yes i 'm taking about the giant tacky bottles in the lobby and the plastic stools in 
i will return to this hotel next time i come to zurich 
they have some other facilities like spa 
but room is very clean and elegant 
and club floor is totally worth it 
the gym was fairly minimal but had enough machines for me to have an adequate work out 
very enjoyable stay at banke hotel we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at banke hotel - the hotel is 
the price is reasonable ( the same as elsewhere ) 
we had a lovely balcony as well which overlooked part of this large property 
and different restaurants with different varieties of locally-sourced puglian cuisine 
) and they were always helpful in finding great activities for all of us to do together 
we ate a group dinner here one night 
as for the restaurants you have the choice between three restaurants which are all pricey for this area but on 
the bathroom was also lovely with a double vanity 
the bed was a little too firm for my taste but had excellent soft pillows 
hotel deco is special and they keep the area tradition tempo 
so do think about this if taking a longer vacation 
great beds and shower 
the restaurants offer great food variety and it must have the biggest breakfast on display in the world 
room was quiet with 2 floors 
snacks etc but you need yen to pay them - no foreign currency and you cant charge to your 
just simply beautifully decorated and the breakfast was incredibly awesome with tons of variety of food that you can choose 
at the moment the hotel is remodelling their regular gym and the alternative facility is a poor option 
out of date airport hotel 
enough options on the hotel that you do need to go outside . 
seemed about a 10 min drive to the hotel on a dark and raining night 
we had made feedback in our last visit a year ago on the dim lighting of the room 
this is one of the better options but it 's a bit more expensive than others 
-- the in-room safe is built in to a cabinet located below the tv and opens from the 
the staff are lovely and friendly 
the hotel is very well located 
a lot of wasted time and money a refund finally appeared minus the usual bank charges for international transactions 
this is one of tokyo 's best hotels 
and common areas are all very clean as well 
quality rooms and the staff are happy to assist 
14 to park car overnight ( standard for hotel parking in manchester ) 
i traipsed back down to reception and the guy who served me came with me to make sure 
air conditioner made a loud noise 
the meals were nothing short of spectacular . 
and a very large bathroom 
both breakfast and evening happy hour are of great variety along with superb service 
but the lounge is good to relax or talk business if it 's not crowded 
nice location 
the location of the hotel is good with three major subway lines very nearby 
we also loved the meal at the pierre gagniere on top of the hotel which had a 
my only comment would be please change the pillow and the bath towels 
free salad 
had great stay here 2 weeks ago 
the bathroom was nice with a separate shower and bath 
close to an airport 
the hugely expensive restaurants have been mentioned by other reviewers 
the hotel is right next to the diplomatic area 
nice shower 
and a large bathroom 
the metro is quite a walk from the hotel but as a tourist you are walking every where anyway 
especially giuseppe from the bar were friendly and very competent 
there is a big mall right in front of the hotel which has a supermarket and burger king apart from 
there was a comprehensive set of amenities and it was clearly well maintained 
we did use room service which is a limited choice and not as good a standard as breakfast 
which had a bigger pool and a small garden space 
espically considering many other similar hotels wouldnt charge for this 
this makes the breakfast experience one of queuing on daily basis 
was spacious and the bed 
breakfast was its redeeming factor . 
this classy hotel offers comfortable rooms and great service 
a small room with an odd layout last time 
the rooms are quite noisy from the expressway outside and the rumbling lifts that seem to be audible 
service very friendly and efficient and top location close to train station ( but very quiet ) and main shopping 
the breakfast was amazing 
the small beach restaurants still exist but are at the edge of the beach not one the beach anymore 
the breakfasts were excellent with lots of choice 
rooms that face the courtyard have only one small window which cannot be left opened 
beautiful hotel with impeccable service 
the concierge was completely unhelpful when we inquired about machu picchu entry tickets 
the location next to the train station is a perfect launching point to view all the major tourist sites in 
the lobby bar area is a peaceful retreat for a quiet read or drink ( or cup of coca 
service and great appointments 
which is such a lovely and lively little town 
we 're attracted to the modern interior and the clever & colourful play on arhcitectural 
what remains of the original building is the exterior walls and facades 
i particularly like the wooden flooring 
with old world charm 
the next hotel we reviewed in a different city was three times the price of the sofitel and 
fabulous rooms ( plus they can pipe in extra oxygen to help deal with the altitude ) 
but a couple of very good restaurants are just across the street ) 
has retained the original decor 
facilities are superb and the breakfast was almost indescribably good -- something for everyone 
the wifi was broken on thursday when we left for machu pichu 
all one can wish for in this friendly german city 
the concierge was able to arrange peru rail tickets to machu picchu for us 
it 's a slight longer walk but you get a view of the city 
the hotel is located within a few minutes walk of the main square and many of the good restaurants in 
is very well fully furnished with all facilities you need 
oversized rooms like it is often the case in airport hotels 
and lunch there is also a good choice 
room even if executive floor was very basic and arriving late you would think that the room catered for 
fantastic breakfast 
the rooms nice enough even if the towels were like sandpaper 
the only minor complaint 
summarydepends what you want but if you looking for a nice hotel for a short stopover 
the hotel is a typical sheraton 
food in the restaurant is very good - though service is slow ( 20 minutes to get a burger at 
the hotel is very centrally located to everything within downtown reykjavik and there is also a 
that cost only about us 17 
supposedly one of the nicest hotels here but to be honest it 's the farthest 
but for a hotel with such a good breakfast buffet 
larger than average rooms 
room on the street was not noisy 
and a short walk brings you to spectacular views 
as well as easy access to the main trails within the park 
especially after a long day walk in the waterfall 
and separate work area 
run-down business hotel in good location 
the pool area was not great but there were plenty of deck chairs and the pool itself was clean 
the breakfast buffet was excellent 
the only place to stay 
we did all the trails and particularly enjoyed our walk at opening time one morning when it felt like we 
there is nothing nicer than seeing your name on a placard once you clear immigration after a long trip 
i got a room facing the falls on the top floor and to me 
very good with an extensive menu 
the room is nice but the carpet was badly stained and needs replacing or cleaning 
nevertheless these are not as important as the location 
firstly the atmosphere and decor is excellent 
does n't feel nice to see they do n't value my loyalty and patronage the room is large 
service at front desk was very good and staff were courteous 
the bathroom had a lovely bathtub 
but the staff at the lounge were very courteous to us and our guests 
a very mediocre hotel set in a perfect location 
the hotel is a bit dated 
the facilities offers luxurious accommodations in pavilions built in the local style and fitted with all possible amenities 
the food service was slow and food just ok but it is the only place to eat 
it means that they never cleaned the bath tub or what 
very centrally located and quick access to downtown 
via the main entrance and you will do fine 
very good property 
it certainly does not deserve the overwhelmingly positive reviews we read before our booking 
the room was lovely and beautifully furnished with an amazing bath in the bedroom and a nice living room which 
the price is really good and the breakfast is good worth the price 
the concierge is very helpful in booking tickets 
the bathroom is equally expansive with separate bathtub and rainforest shower 
luxurious and superb service 
small round table and soft chair 
it was a short walk to the acropolis 
6 ) do n't just be going around in cabs . 
set 20 minutes walk from the centre of milan ( there is a courtesy shuttle limo ) this 
the meeting room was huge and professionally well-designed 
the pool was small but looked like this area had been done up as had more modern sunlou 
i chose to park my car outside and risk getting ticket for not paying by the hour 
my bed was narrow - the mattress far too soft and lumpy and the pillow as hard as stone 
the breakfast buffet was great 
the hotel lobby bar is packed with dates 
i normally stay at the meridien near the klia express station but there was a global meeting 
beautiful furniture and heavy curtains coupled with an astonishingly comfortable bed and a large 
good breakfasts 
we had to keep the balcony door open ( thank god we booked a room with a balcony ) while 
upper floors are nice 
the good sized bathroom was richly stocked with amenities and the bath large and inviting 
additionally non alcoholic drinks are available throughout the day until 11 
but it 's a great gym 
high ceilings 
we were given a great upgrade thanks to spg platinum status 
the subway station is all well connected 
the concierge staff was incredibly friendly and helpful on several occasions - one in particular they helped coordinate 
i read in another review that this was the ultimate complement for a hotel and you can get a good 
great for midtown but 
we had a late lunch on arrival 
this was by far the best hotel stay i 've experienced in new york city 
not luxurious but charming 
good location 
great location for shopping and close to train stop 
it is fine dining but not too ostentatious 
location location location in the middle of it all- if you like shopping then this is the hotel for 
if you are looking for a convenient place to stay for a shopping trip 
nice hotel with a number of good restaurants inside 
this is a huge resort with gorgeous views 
the place does not come cheap but then it is real value for money 
they 'll golf buggy you to the street if you need 
but you would be missing out on some good attractions 
on the first floor right off the lobby with elevators in front and terraces pool in the back 
it wasn 't all that clean - some days they emptied the rubbish bins and changed all the 
will definitely return for my next trip to bok 
ocean view - top floor - rooms 3541 
hotel is located in an unbeatable location 
we 're not going back after the last visit and here are just a few of the reasons 
we requested in our booking that the kids bed be made up ready to go on arrival as we had 
elegantly comfortable ask for a non-smoking room . 
about what you would expect from an airport hotel in europe 
the beds were huge 
you can get the same room for less than usd 200 
the employees are friendly 
nice hotel if you are in transit or short stay but rather far from the center of prague 
the late check-inn was fast and friendly and it was a short walk to my clean and spacious 
although hardware like the lobby 
even though prices are higher than any sofitel in bangkok 
great rooms- modern and well kept 
the refreshing welcome drink 
the problem with this is long queues at reception sometimes and some pushy tourists who want to get in 
we had dinner at the roof top restaurant on 8th floor 
no welcome drink provided 
the city transport bus stop is a minute walk from the hotel 
there are many excellent restaurants 
this is all coupled by a lack of clothes hanging storage space as well as a shortage of properly placed 
bravo to management and a great team 
the staff were friendly and tried hard but there were definitely some issues with getting the correct information from the 
minor flaw is that their version of a king bed is literally 2 double beds stuck together 
location is very good as it is near a mall and the old city 
great city centre location with excellent service 
and shower had great water flow 
the rooms are standard size but have big windows with fantastic views on both sides of the hotel 
with good reviews 
with outstanding views of the city and the mountains 
but all made up by excellent service and very good quality room service 
we stayed at lion sands ( river lodge ) for 3 nights with a large group 
it was a decent walk to the sap center 
the hilton is one of the best located hotels 
it 's actually been very good 
restaurant staff are friendly & attentive 
for a budget hotel you could do much worse and if you are after a good location 
good value for money 
the exec lounge is tired and the breakfast in there is very limited - with not much more on the 
the size of the room itself was very spacious and came with a small kitchenette 
bad point - reception is very busy 
walk to all cbd and harbour delights incl the gorgeous park lands and gay oxford st a 
get a higher floor 
with a bathroom that had a tub 
super comfortable king size bed 
the hotel room was excellent value for money 
- from the outside it looks like a modern hotel 
terrible wifi 
a right turn from the main entrance of the hotel and after two stop lights bring you to sloven 
the bathroom was very good 
delicate and the location is good . 
they gave us an hour later checkout because of our flight and had already ordered our cab 
right on the main shopping drag a short walk from district 1 
we got an excellent rate online and when we checked in we were upgraded for free as we were traveling 
very good bedding and silent room 
rooms are nice with good beds and a great shower 
lovely property 
the suite was big 
it is also walking distrance to the town square and the oldest castle 
they changed their internet provider and the wifi is probably the worst i ever experienced 
the hot tub but that was fun 
my room is also on the first floor which my profile states high floor king bed away from elevators 
very small lounge but we had it to ourselves on the last night 
from central station via tram its around 20 minutes 
decent enough rooms but everything is a bit tired and worn 
and surprisingly one door would not even close properly - it had to be slammed ( as shown by a 
the lobby and bar area is airy 
luxurious hotel in a super downtown location 
ask for a canal view room for spectacular views onto old ghent 
breakfast was nice with extensive selection and good quality 
it is also easy to walk to gastown and chinatown 
the room was nicely decorated and the beds comfortable 
in a lovely old paris building and very handy for restraunts and metro ( richeli 
and instead was very friendly in feel - like staying in the home of a wealthy 
reception personnel very nice and efficient 
quiet room except the high pitched noise when the room next-door uses their water 
my friend had lost the passport in flight and the hotel reception was very helpful is making the calls and 
always walked past this place and wondered what it would be like to stay here 
the best located hotel in this price range 
including a lovely bottle of wine and card that was signed and given to us by the staff at the 
the lobby is exceptionally modern and always seems to be buzzing ( granted---berlinale was in full 
there are many other great hotels in berlin 
outside there are scores of reasonable restaurants and coffee shops in the sony centre 
most of the stuff from housekeeping to room service did not speak any language but german 
the checking was quick and smooth 
it has access to a few shopping malls and has good dining options close by 
the concierge service is amazing 
restaurant is lovely and breakfast was good 
on the plus side you know what you are going to get 
our room was a good size although the location of the air conditioner by one side of the bed 
ended up back at the hotel after an exhausted day to a lovely room 
high tea mid week 
location and furnishings are what you pay for 
kind of a strange smell in the sauna zone though 
tastefully decorated 
fabulous views of beach & sunset 
the swimming pool is beautifully located and of course heated to a perfect temperature 
the room pleasant but it was the staff who made the experience outstanding 
the bedrooms are nice hyatt bedrooms with very comfortable beds and the central location is a good for seeing 
the bed and pillows were too soft for me 
unlike other luxury properties there is no welcome drink or cold towel to greet you 
the bathroom is indeed spacious 
the sea ranch cottages are located in a separate area which has a far more superior view 
they promised pool bar opened by 1 
nice marriott property with good pools and space 
the food at the restaurant was terrible and the cocktails were overpriced and were not of a decent quality 
i 'd always been fascinated by the grand hotel of melbourne 
shower water pressure is good and the include toiletries smell nice 
we loved the olde world charm 
the country club and the embassy residences to the multiplaza shopping mall rooms are spacious and well maintained

teh overall setting of the hotel is quite nice 
overall good hotel with nicely appointed rooms 
breakfast spread was also nice 
a great marriott 
the morning buffet had a wonderful assortment of tropical fruits and smoothies 
even a top quality sparecommend 
this hyatt felt similar to andaz brands that i 've stayed in 
the gym on the top floor has excellent views of berlin and up-to-date equipment 
overall it was a relaxing stay . 
the bathrooms are especially hospital-room like with plain white tile and complete absence of character 
but perhaps two seperate areas should be considered for everyone 's enjoyment 
- ) hotel also offer free daily laundry for two pieces 
impressive swimming pool 
the fitness centre is n't great and the rooms can be a little noisy 
the general manager 
facility is outstanding ( really park hyatt standard ) 
i 've been fortunate enough to stay in many of the worlds hyatt 's 
the only major problem we found was with ants . 
there is a separate tub and shower 
the restaurant was really superb 
it is upscale and the service is solid 
the excellent pool service & food we had around the pool 
first day we turned up to the meeting room found it small with one round table for 6 people 
staff were helpful although waiters at times had to be beckoned for service 
the signature bulgari toiletries leaves one refreshed after the shower and the complementary candies 
a 5 star luxury hotel worthy of the status 
the grounds are lovely on the edge of the perfume river and there is a very nice pool 
) the public rooms are fine and the free internet a bonus 
come to hue , the romantic city . 
pool is 17m and the spa has cold and hot baths 
took my own bags to my room as all bellboys busy 
the hotel staff was very helpful 
the room had a bit of a musty smell and the toiletries could have been better 
i recommend direct booking with the hotel should you like to include a transportation option to hoi an 
going around using the subway means that you have to go down a long flight of stairs and a long 
just a short walk to the hobart aquatic centre 
great bakeries for artisan baguettes and the occasional pastry 
and as i said the price is excellent 
the garden is beautifully manicured and the courtyard is nicely landscaped with a small herb vegetable patch at 
funky place in a great location 
arranging tours on the street by yourself will be less expensive 
with elegant public spaces both inside and out 
elegant old world charm 
this is a classic hotel 
good location-many shops and restaurants near by 
the rooms were nice and the room service was good 
this is definitly a good value for an airport hotel 
didnt get time to enjouy all it has to offer but free internet 
a good hotel in a nice quiet area 
the decor is a little dated but it 's better than the new but hideous peninsula 
just take your laptop down to the lobby for free 
with a separate lounge area and dressing room 
club loungethe club lounge staff were very helpful 
but carpet is old 
this is a good spot to stay if you plan on being downtown for food and shopping . 
the pull up space on mies van der rohe is superior to the situation for hotels fronting 
try a better category then standard room 
good centrally located hotel 
bed was comfortable and they supplied different pillows i requested when booking also 
the walk in closet and the bathroom was spacious 
if you are a very light sleeper take ear plugs in case you hear st paul 's hourly 
the glowing advertisement pillar in the foyer is a nightmare 
i have stayed almost 12-15 times in this hotel over the last 5 years 
the pool on the top floor was amazing and there is a great italian restaurant right in front of 
the apartment is complete where you can cook or reheat anything 
stayed at the mayfair marriott for work for three nights last week 
no one could explain what extra amenities an executive room brought 
our bedroom was comfortable with a great powerful shower 
facilities were excellent and a couple of freshly made sandwiches ordered from 24-hour room service were beautifully 
spacious apartments 
what you can expect from a westin . 
unfortunately the front desk staff was not as friendly as i would have liked and they barely greeted me 
ca n't make up my mind city view rooms are much better i have stayed at the grange 
you must always see the context of where the reviewed hotel etc 
the bars and common areas are uninspiring and the much advertised rooftop bar not available because it is 
a laundry ( if you do not want to use the washing machine with the free detergent provided ) 
great facilities and great location 
parking is also free 
the rooms are spacious ( and we got an upgrade ) and the hotel has all the amenities you might 
bathroom clean and nicely arranged 
good sized bathroom that was well lit and plenty of space for makeup 
bathroom was decently sized 
good location 
1 complimentary breakfast or points2 complimentary internet service3 daily newspaperthe room type we stayed is 
handful stationary and excellent amenities 
basement parking is available for guests but it is at 25 aud per 24 hours 
rooms are n't huge but on these kind of stays you are outside most of the time anyway 
if noise disturbs you during night 
we order three nights on hotels . 
the bathroom is a great size and beautifully appointed 
bathrooms are modern with good amenities 
the room is quite big and adequately equipped 
high floors have better views 
the breakfast area gets crowded prior to a cruise departure 
there is good hotel dining options 
nice staff 
plus all the other great concierge service you expect & get from a park hyatt 
good value for money 
thank goodness i had a coupon for a free night stay 
the bathroom was huge and well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable 
and i was most glad that parking was free 
good hotel near airport 
the pool was full of babies the whole time 
had a late arriving flight 
we took a taxi directly from the airport to the hotel 
they are so polite and provide a great customer service 
was very pleasant & we had a trouble free 15 min transfer to terminal 7 
wifi is only available in the reception area and there was no internet connection at all during the time 
local traffic connection is great - trams 47 
finally the grande which is the newest area 
very close to the beach and has good business facilities 
the conference facilities were excellent and everything worked out well - but the hotel side of it was a bit 
the jw marriott tomorrow square is an amazing 5 star hotel 
i could see the pools were quite nice 
the rooms are more spacious 
service and concierge service fantastic 
the lounge has a big terrace with great views of barcelona city and the sea 
the bed and pillows were amazing 
my husband and i had the eggs benedict which was wonderful and the pastries just melted in 
excellent gym 
it is really the finest & the most luxurious desert resort i stayed in a bedouin suite which 
with the people 's square metro station a short walk away 
the bed and bath rooms are very clean 
hotel is a good business hotel 
the bathrooms was nice ( better than portman ritz carlton ) 
i also found the pool and spa very difficult to get to - as it involved multiple lifts 
check in is on the 38th floor and the hotel rooms are above that 
the facilities and staff at the hotel were fanatstic and the service and help we got from the 
everything free of charge 
the staff were very friendly and helpful 
drinks and snacks available are limited outside the two hours open bar 
and cheap metro 
the resort is lovely and you do have the animals roaming freely outside your rooms 
i need to send a package back home to the us and the lady working there was very helpful 
rooms are ample in size 
not the cheapest and the wifi is n't great 
our stay was mostly pleasant 
the tea coffee amenities were not refreshed on the second day and i had to call for housekeeping on 
making this particular holiday the best value for money i have experienced anywhere in years 
the food at the hotel is poor and pricey 
with very large windows which make it light and bright 
abit expensive but location is central 
huge spacious rooms 
you ca n't help but be impressed with a hotel where the lobby is on the 38th floor 
more spacious and moderns while the non smoking rooms are with really old and outdated furniture that must have 
breakfast is buffet style and good 
there are day trips available from the hotel as well ( brewster canada has a desk in the 
stayed in a basic room which was very small but adequate ( think the bathroom was as big as 
we decided to stay on the gold floor based on recommendations 
if you can accept 20-30min walk you can reach xintiandi and the bund 
but poor airport shuttle service 
clean and free wifi 
5 star prices but feels like 3 star 
had an excellent treatment in the spa - similar price to other hotels worldwide 
what i really like are the staff as they are allapproachable and very helpful 
which was greatly appreciated 
quite noisy traffic 
was a great spread 
in room dining is great 
was ok and it showed what a great team all of the hotel staff are and the pride they have 
this is a very smart hotel with very large entrance and most of the rooms overlook the lake and the 
your own lounge for breakfast and drinks and snacks in the evening 
but it 's certainly the best service i 've ever had in that city 
the japanese place on the same road is good quality and value but quite busy 
great linens and bed 
the rooms are very cramped so not easy to bring big luggage 
enough chairs and nice bathroom and toilet like in japan 
the suite was perfectly nice with 
6 ) english level of the front desk ladies is not that good 
and a lot of interesting sights within the hotel 
room is relatively small but bathroom is spacious 
cable car and streetcar are also nearby 
spectacular setting and ambience 
wait staff is very accommodating and can do 
we had acess to a very nice gym and heated pool 
the suite is very nice with great views and well appointed 
there is a lovely walk around part of the lake 
the big positive is the front desk and concierge staff 
which may have worked out well as we drove out and had an excellent dinner 
the room service breakfast was very good so we are pleased with the decision to stay here for my college 
room design and condition to room service and housekeeping 
we had trouble getting good lounge chairs 
probably the best pina colada i ever had- away form the craziness of the main towers 
the service was as one can expect from four seasons ie 
'you can see the hills beyond the parking lot of the office buildings adjacent to the hotel 
we had dinner in poppy 's restaurant which was good but pricey 
the hotel has only 5 rooms with balconeis and if you can secure one it is well worth 
the dynamite roll at the sushi bar is one of the best sushi dishes i have ever had 
breakfast in lago restaurant ( the morning dining venue ) was the usual fairmont spread - good 
gold floor is not worth the extra money 
stayed 3 night last week for business trip 
there is no doubt that this is some of the most beautiful country in the world however to have a 
nstaff were friendly but reception became confused with relatively straight forward issues 
and i 'll be staying here again next time 
cold meats and sandwiches 
the spacious double room was great 
breakfast like so many hotels is a zoo - many many empty tables by people lining the chairs waiting 
good restaurants 
very closed to the airport 
free bikes 
with the exception of the real upmarket establishments like the four seasons which have the disadvantage of being over 
large bathroom 
bathroom and amenities very nice 
there is hardly anything to fault about this hotel and the espa spa treatments are amazing 
the lobby is very busy and connected to a small shopping arcade that is handy 
they had a lovely gym and a heated pool 
very central location 
it 's a short walk to la rambla and placa catalunya 
rooms a little tired 
great roof top pool and bar with spectacular views 
club lounge was okay but food was n't very appetising 
the gym had a huge variety of cardio 
the beds are old and uncomfortable and i did not have a good nights sleep for the 5 days 
and a great area 
the friendly and helpful hotel staff adds to the attraction 
everything about this hotel is great-the beautiful grounds 
staff provides great customer service - especially pablo at the front desk 
the bar in reception is open ad hoc 
the bathroom was also a very good size with a great shower 
compares with most hk sized roomsnice selection for the free breakfast 
highly recommend this amazing hotel 
and a myriad of food and drink options at your doorstep 
stayed all different hotels in hk and proberlery this was biggest room for single occupancy 
this hotel is very good 
there 's a carrefour ( hypermarket ) about 10-15 mins walk away or you 
it 's the little touches like this that makes all the difference 
even with real coffee machine in addition to a kettle for tea ( not many hotels have both 
the pool was the best we 've experienced with multiple layers ( more shallow parts for families and deeper 
i do not plan to return on my next visit as it was n't a fit for all of 
so it is very convenient ( better than the the airport express train ) 
pity they did not install dimmer for lighting in the corridors ) and cosmetic products are the ones 
good service overall and nicely decorated rooms 
it has beautiful public areas 
and in our case these low temperatures were also in our two rooms ( in addition 
food at mei jiang and thiptara were of a good standard and we enjoyed our meals 
hotel services were good 
very nice boutique style hotel 
however wifi in the room was horribly slow and given the tonnes of business travelers it seemed like a 
room was lovely - split level with a nice lounge area on the ground floor 
i think they were working on it as it smelled wet and damp 
and there is a big mall next door with a supermarket etc - so very handy 
a short walk to the nearby marriott connected us to the hop-on hop-off bus 
he can access your wardrobe and pantry from the corridor outside so he can take care of ironing 
our room had a nice view of the river but the finishing touches were a little dated 
rooms probably ready for next renovation 
small wardrobe 
it is an older hotel but immaculately maintained 
but you are there - ask for high floor 
only downside is when its cold its a long walk into the city centre 
so kudos to the front desk staff 
this newly opened hotel is a gem 
i got a room which smells like the smokers lounge of an airport 
the hotel has 5 restaurants 
the spa with its jacuzzi is brilliant and the rooftop infinity pool is small but watches over 
at times the power can get cut but it immediately gets restored most likely by the generator 
really good fitness centre that came with a full range of free weights as well as machines and cardio stations 
there was a big in room safe 
the bathroom was very large with two sinks always a plus when getting ready 
the gym is located on the rooftop floor with a very nice view of the nearby city area 
the last time i was not happy with the breakfast but this time there has been a huge marked improvement 
the service levels are very high indeed and the staff throughout the hotel are friendly and approachable 
very good airport hotel 
the bed was very comfy and all the amenities were excellent although the all electric controls took some getting 
it offers typical services of the marriott group and with corporate rates codes that stay will be decently 
at times the pool felt like you were in the midst of a kindergarten outing 
maybe i 'll try one of the other marriotts in the area next time 
the hotel is very modern 
staff is attentive , breakfast in the lounge is better than most marriotts . 
but priced a bit high 
in which we also had an excellent dinner 
a foyer for your luggage and a massive modern marble bathroom 
the pool and spa are amazing and service everywhere excellent 
i went over the 24 hour limit and ended up paying an extra 14 dollars for an extra hour and 
there are cheaper garage options or street parking is available and some of the spots are free from 6 pm 
with a lovely bath and shower 
dont miss a very interesting ( and free ) little museum on the civil war that is practically at 
they first put me on the 18th floor facing a really busy noisy street where you can hear the 
with beautiful decor and amazing views of the chao praya river 
high chairs and so on were provided free during our stay 
he 'd make an excellent concierge if he would be interested 
one of the best hotels we stayed in 
the restaurants and the awesome pool side staff 
the hotel rooms are swedish spartan but entirely comfortable in particular the bed was a dream 
staff were delightful 
the room was ok 
the rooms are a fairly good size and the higher floors allow for beautiful views of downtown 
i could still see the smiles and the smell of the orchid at the mo 
they have a nice breakfast room 
and you can eat with a beautiful view to the bay in front of the hotel 
show head was broken buffets used to be better now lost authentic feel and tasting like hotel food not 
good fast wifi throughout 
the north tower is taller than the south tower and offers splendid views 
the view from our window on the 33rd floor was superb too 
would highly recommend . 
the lobby is big but felt a little awkward because there was n't a grand main entrance to the 
the elevators are fast and there are four of them so little wait 
i did n't realize when ordering just how small it would be- the bell boy offered to put 
free wifi 
we had the usual nice starwood bed which was good 
we stayed here for 3 nights prior to a cruise 
46 overnight valet 41 if self-parked 
the shower had a nice rain head 
there are several good options for dining and entertainment in the hotel and within walking distance 
the hotel has one of the finest restaurant rang mahal which serves indian cuisine 
from reservations to front desk to restaurants 
there is lots of shopping nearby but everything was closed as we arrived late sunday afternoon 
lunch by the pool was excellent 
a great setting on the beach and a very comfortable hotel to stay 
room we were given on the first night was small with twin beds even though i booked a king bed 
the staff was friendly and efficient on sri lankan standards 
impressive entrance hall and staff were eager to please 
no gym or pool in the hotel although you can buy a day pass for a gym about 500met 
no atm machine inside hotel 
it is one of six hotels in northern ireland owned by the hastings group , all of 
beds are comfy and location is great 
45am to catch an early flight 
a petite mall with various dining choices and a theatre where we also watched a movie 
i like the area of upper sukhumvit as well the quiet location of the hotel j 
nicely decorated & very comfortable suites - bigger than many condos today - with a very comfortable bed & 
rooms are a reasonable size with good views 
bedroom and massive bathroom that included a jacuzzi tub and separate stand alone shower 
the concierge was excellent 
a higher floor has better views 
overall i will always go to a w hotel bar . 
the fitness centre and indoor lap pool is great and better than most hotel fitness centres 
everyone genuinely tried to remedy every issue that arose and wanted to give me something as a compensation ( everyone 
the high floors have remarkable views and the club lounge is well worth it 
they also have a very well sticked mini bar 
but the pool and hot tub were both a good size 
the hotel also has a direct access to the royal shopping mall in which there is also a skytrain 
lobby area can get busy but its large and you do n't queue for long 
the room was of adequate size with space for a table and couple of arm chairs 
i was told the parking was cheaper to pay the company who runs the parking verse the hotel 
stayed here twice - small double & apartment 
wifi is quite fast and works well rooms are quite big and toiletries are well provided 
then i found out they gave a good view rooms ( from instagram ) 
handy to a tram stop so a good spot for getting around the cbd 
the gym was very good and the pool area was fine for a city hotel 
the room was well equipped and pleasantly quiet 
great airport hotel 
we were picked up from the delta terminal and there were 2 stops ( including the parking area ) 
a second more cosier living room with a large bathroom with separate tub and shower and double sinks as 
although given there are scores of great cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance 
facing south for great sunsine and came with a huge balcony offering spectacular city views and comfortable seating 
hotel lobby is beautiful 
spacious with truly professional staff 
the best airport hotel ever 
we had one day to spend in the city and wanted something centrally located 
the front desk had my cell phone number 
but for those who have to come here for work its a nice little oasis 
chose this hotel due to location of business being close and airport being close as well 
quiet area 
blocks your view and lets water escape 
service is wonderful across the board - from the valet to the housekeeping 
booked deluxe suite 
while you wait for your food you get treated with a mini starter from the chef which is different everyday 
small gym and a very nice dining room are offered as well 
the spa is used by top celebrities and it is the quality you would expect 
the only problem i have was the quality of hotel room service food ( although price was ok ) the 
there is a small but very well heated pool with a nice terrace area 
beautiful swimming pool and gym 
good quality food and beverage it is a great choice if enjoying what sydney has to offer 
we were cordially welcomed back by the friendly reception staff 
good service - only downside was the outdoor pool which was tiny and cold 
it 's free of charge 
the polo lounge is a bit overpriced for drinks 
good value for money given the great location 
the bed was very comfortable 
with large marble bathrooms 
it smelled old and moldy ( my wife is very allergic to mold ) 
the bed was very comfortable 
staff is extremely helpful and nice with the exception of a guy named azzim at the front desk 
internet is a bit pricey 
through a similarly warm welcome at the front desk to entering one 's cozy 
i really love the charm and old world grandeur of this place and cannot recommend it enough 
small touches like a coffee machine in the room 
great marble 
the internet is absolutely free and yet high quality ( quite a contrast to australia where i often 
the property has wide open and somehow private shoreline 
( front desk staff were pleasant and professional 
this old fashioned traditional hotel has a location that ca n't be beat 
and could easily take a bus or metro when i did not feel like walking 
room was exceptionally well appointed with comfortable beds and attention to detail that went from the plethora of coffee and 
and if you can get a good internet price 
the infinity pool was amazing - great when the sun is going down and a private beach 
one bar and limited public space 
how can this hotel accept guests risking their health 
it 's very convenient for the vaporetti and station if you need it and there are plenty 
a separate wc ( with a glass door ) 
perfect for relaxing after a long day walking around the city 
our room was fantastic and the hospitality team looking after us went way beyond the call of duty 
there are plenty of restaurant choices nearby 
font office and concierge desk are helpful and very friendly 
still a great location in potsdammer platz 
with free weights and some nautilus equipment 
i was pleasantly surprised by how nice the room was being a holiday inn 
they have a large pool area and a newsletter of activities in the hotel grounds 
quite a nice coffee shop in the lobby where you can buy snacks 
in general i think the jw is a better deal than more expensive disney properties and is nicer 
arrived in berlin after a long business trip in london 
breads and freshly squeezed orange juice 
the towels acceptable 
the bedroom is a good size 
the aircon is an antique and barely works 
the public areas are also very attractively presented 
the location is very convenient with loads of places to eat close by 
it was a good stay 
bathroom was elegantly decorated 
rooms are clean and spacious 
and will be back next trip 
really welcoming hotel reception staff 
the rooms very quiet and comfortable 
overall good for a conference but i would n't stay here on a regular holiday 
help to book restaurants and give great recommendations 
the hotel should have special policies for these dates 
the front desk staff helped us book tours and with various other travel arrangements around the city 
we were fortunate to be offered a room upgrade to the club floor and were perfectly satisfied with the room 
coffee very good 
great walkway for jogging and easy to have a quick swim 
room had a free minibar ( incl 
there is an adult pool area 
would return for the right price 
booked an oceanview one-bedroom suite 
warm with first class furniture and beautiful view 
the bar made be to your taste 
the property is so big it 's impersonal and if you want an intimate hotel 
) the front desk staff was helpful and professional 
the concierge staff was very helpful in planning winery visits and dinner reservations 
the hotel is located away from everything but the beach 
this is a magnificent hotel with stunning amenities - particularly the pool and bar areas 
claudio the doorman and guilanna at reception desk were very friendly 
the room was spacious and generally clean but decorated in a very bland and monotone style not unlike 
the fontainebleau hotel is a very big resort type hotel where the rooms are average quality and 
there was a good pool and spa 
though a rather standard size for a hotel gym 
outstanding customer service and prime location 
the service is very attentive 
that does casual food and has live music 
had a wonderful stay in sofitel brisbane 
the decor is a little too conservative for my taste but that is a very small quibble - overall 
all in all a nice hotel with a paris theme 
the only issue was that my wife felt the toilet would have been better if it offered some privacy by 
many of the amenities were n't completed 
but room service was good 
room was very well appointed and bed very comfy and large bathroom with good products 
nearby is the vivo city for all your shopping needs 
disappointing . 
well decorated and very clean 
requested for a king bed but was told not available when checking in 
great upgrade to a room overlooking the square with a super comfy bed 
rooms are resort like 
they have a fantastic pool 
my only nit pic is that all the communial furniture ie balcony lounge area is very uncomfortable and not 
the bunk bed is large enough for an adult 
nice rooms 
the skyline is beautiful and also you can see the sea 
complete with pay internet 
beautiful lighting and audio visual system and small touches like built in tv above bathtub are great surprises 
good concierge and easy to access 
rooms are comfortable with all necessary amenities 
rooms were great 
also breakfast is at the hr or the michael 
the beach is dirty and it is generally better on the east side of the island ( nusa d 
one of the best hotels 
2 ) the aircon is poorly sited in the rooms such that both my kids got running nose 
the only thing that does not work in the hotel 's favour is its location ( although jumping in 
internet is not free of charge 
a good range of restaurants appeal for all tastes 
only disappointment was no free wifi helps when you 're an international traveller and you want to share your 
food at the hotel was generally good quality - breakfast selection was pretty wide - their banana pancakes were great 
and opulent indian decor 
the spa facility is very good but they must improve on the serving time for friday dinner . 
helpful reception staff 
at a reasonable price 
as a monthly visited to delhi i went to see the hotel and have to say the decor and 
they have a distinct old touch to the hotel and rooms but could have done a much better job in 
the service is at its best 
they go to specific hotels 
the gym was of a good size 
i would heartily reccomend this as your first stop in india to recover from flight 
the rooms were still large with a comfortable bed and two easy chairs 
and had a somewhat larger combined bathroom toilet area with two sinks 
the sound proofing leaves much to be desired - we were kept awake by a group of enthusiastic toddlers 
the service was generally slow 
the room and the bathroom is amazing and top notch 
the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom clean and modern 
the bag was effectively delivered to the reception of the hotel when we checked in later on in the evening 
the room itself was spacious and comfortable 
they upgraded me to a pool side room with is fantastic 
and make sure you get there at least 2 hrs before your international flight as immigration is terrible 
thank you very much for your random free upgrade when i checked in and your late check out permission on 
room was medium size but nice 
hotel is huge with mass crowds clearly all there for one reason and one reason only ie easy access 
) a great buffet breakfast with western and eastern choices 
we had two double beds and plenty of space 
tasteless and just catered for big volume but i suppose that is what disney is all 
the spa suite is amazingly spacious and it has view to pool and also to the ocean 
the reason i am hung up on grout is that last week i reviewed the lotte in mos 
newish property 
swimming pool is soooo nice ( a must experience 
all you can eat fresh sushi and sashimi - delicious 
flo ( a french guy ) is really outstanding and went all the way to make us feel welcome and 
you will be happy to stay here 
fabulous location in south delhi 
we called about kids' activities and they did n't know right away 
we did not know that it wasnt allowed in public areas and the guard was not letting up 
the staff were completely wonderful 
swiming pool was large but not nice 
) the pool is nice 
with a wonderful panoramic of the private beach 
fabulous accommodation 
the scale of the palace and the grounds were truly awesome 
the beach is beautiful 
staff were great on check in following a mix up with the rooms and names ( not the hotels 
have 3 different tips in your pocket for your delivery to your room 
friendly and engaging staff are always so good at anticipating needs ( e 
has a super sized swimming pool 
deep large bath and bathroom 
the room and all the facilities were top rate and the staff all very pleasant and helpful 
free bottles of water 
the bar and dining area completely different 
nice price for 5star hotel 
the pool is excellent but again slightly let down by the pool furniture which has seen better days 
i would recommend booking dinner and potentially exploring beforehand to get an idea of the palace . 
and an amazing spa offering ayerveda 
i had overseas italian guests with me and the only food that was available was a very strange buffet 
the buffet restaurant had a la carte menu but did n't actually serve it 
the room is decently sized and the entry to each courtyard is something you have to experience 
my wife and i stayed 3 nights in early december 
the rooms are what you would expect for the hilton 
in fact it is the tallest building in town and was the highest in the country before the tai 
i paid a very reasonable low price for my stay so i am not complaining 
free wi-fi in lobby only worked for 2 days out of 4 
nice view with good service 
since only the top floors of the building house the hotel 
yes it 's a large resort 
the only drawback is the location as it is located so far away from all the attractions and the city 
overall good clean property 
the hotel is modern and our room had wonderful sea views with a large balcony 
the bedroom had a lounge area to the side with an l-shaped couch 
it takes time and lots of walking from one location to the other 
but the lobby reception feels like an airport checkin 
like amazing i love love love the hotel i am hope sense to me that the kind of service the 
it 's a short walk into the town and they have a shuttle if you do n't fancy 
we we tried to get to a more interesting area we were turned away 
the pool is nice although somewhat stark by modern standards 
staff was friendly and location good 
i had a quick walk into the old town on saturday morning and it is a brisk 10 minute 
rooms are well set up with all amenities you would expect from such a hotel 
it is not worth staying here 
but a short 100m walk takes you to mandurah estuary 
with a huge balcony and a great view overlooking mandjar bay and the mandurah town centre 
the hotel is also on the waterfront so good for morning walks etc and is also close to many restaurants 
we were so excited as a family of four to be staying the resort however the standard of customer service 
the rooms are well appointed and the facilities very good 
i have done bad reviews when the hotel does not stand up to the standards 
we were treated like special guests our entire trip 
available from the back entrance near the metro station 
where you walk out to the waterfront & a nice stroll to the eateries 
overall it 's pricey and the beach is n't great but it the hotel is nice 
room comes with typical conveniences plus robes 
we opted for an imperial club room which come with loads of benefits including free entry to most of the 
our triple room is one king size bed with one single bed 
better suited to asian style 
the restaurants are amazing 
staff service and hospitality never dissapoint you 
easy to get into the city and close to restaurants etc 
the food and beverage offerings in the imperial club lounge during afternoon tea and happy hour were pretty basic 
we did n't have enough time to fully explore experience all the hotel had to offer but would recommend 
we had to queue to get our free tickets to the aquarium ( which we liked once we were in 
we suddenly felt so very tired after a long flight 
but there are probably better hotels around for couples 
front desk a bit unwelcoming 
this hotel is a disgrace and i would recommend that everybody should stay away from such a heartless unc 
the adult pool was chilly ( so-so service at the pool ) 
we stayed here for 2 days and it was like heaven for the kids . 
check the one and only on the palm if you are looking for something nice and quiet on the palm 
to see them from our bedroom window and dine with them in the dining room was a great experience 
as a guest you can choose where you want to dine 
we also had lunch and breakfast at kaleidoscope which was good quality with a good selection but not 
finding your way in this underground maze is as confusing as it can get 
from high tea with the giraffes to feeding them from your bedroom window 
they could do with more comfortable chairs outside for guests who just want to chill out and enjoy the gir 
room was clean and reasonable size 
the staff is very helpful in guiding the guests to properly feed the giraffes 
you can watch them on the property and you can walk to the sanctuary below 
2 minutes walk from the huge and fancy shopping malls where you can find all famous brands 
very pricey but worth it 
free wireless internet in the lounge 
for what they charge you its perfet 
our room was a sanctuary river view which was a good size and nicely appointed with a huge bed 
the birthday cake from the hotel was a nice gesture . 
with the big plazas less than 10 mins walk away 
the club lounge is nice and had decent apps last night also and a friendly server too 
but then they are double the price 
ethereal and romantic - we drank champagne whist watching the underwater world and were mesmerized by the 
not happy when front desk forgot my wake up call and just made flight 
all of the general services staff are fantastic 
its definitely worth staying here 
the hotel is located on 11th street right of i-35 
the line at 1 point stretched from the restaurant to the main door of the hotel ( 20 people ) 
afternoon tea and happy hour drinks from 5-7pm every night 
very limited menu for hb guests and the food was very ordinary 
but they did provide extra beds for the kids 
this is a very elegant hotel 
it is a superb retreat with extensive facilities and excellent staff 
clean rooms 
the coffee station was out of coffee and no one was checking 
rooms facing main road is quite noisy in day time as it is a heavy traffic main road 
distance to central dublin is about a 20 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride - so central enough 
modern decor 
all major retailers and restaurants 
reasonably priced for bed and an excellent breakfast 
executive lounge is very nice 
the pool on the top floor is great 
our room was good but had only one small window looking onto a service yard and the mirror in the 
some of the room service options and mini-bar drinks were on the expensive side 
breakfast buffet was ample and the service was extremely attentive and polite 
there is lovely turndown service 
i would also say it was very good value for the money since we paid a reduced group rate of 
there is also an adults only pool with an infinity edge for those wanting more peace and quiet 
meeting rooms are available at your cost 
decent airport hotel 
this is an excellent airport hotel 
lights in the room is a little weird as the headboard lights are very bright 
there are nice subtle touches everywhere 
also easy to catch taxis 
not very nice building 
lunch and dinner and does them all well and i ragazzi is good quality italian 
grand oldie hotel 
location is 10-15 minutes walk outside the historic central area and ten minutes from the main art galleries 
stayed in two connecting twins rooms with my mother 
we stayed 1 night at novotel taoyuan as our flight arrived very late in the 
staff greats you at the first floor rerception 
it is an old building ( with a rather dated air conditioning unit in our room ) and many of 
quality does not match the price sitting in my room roasting . 
very close to the airport with an efficient shuttle service 
very , very disappointing . 
full of nice touches 
lunch and dinner buffet is very good and on saturday and sundays the lunch buffet offering is 
often bump into celebrities . 
the lobby area is nice and the staff were efficient and professional 
good service and ambiance and the breakfast in the morning was delicious 
and of course there is a free shuttle bus from the airport 
it never camethe hotel is next to a mall and probably that 's convenient 
the staff at the executive lounge are friendly and helpful and the vies are beautiful 
the hotel is large and features extensive use of marble 
we had a really early flight out of taiwan 
the indoor pool and facilities were top notch 
a window between bath and bedroom means you might wake up the other guest if you turn on the light 
a good stay herein in guangzhou 
serviceable for early departures 
i was on an executive floor and had a nicely-sized room which had the appearance of a modern 
great bed etc etc 
above average for an airport hotel 
the breakfast was extensive and the return to the airport equally as efficient as the arrival 
with an easy shuttle to terminals one and two 
also i appreciate cares all staff in executive lounge i think it is very good facility maybe a little bit 
although the mini bar contained wine bottles 
pick the one near powell station if you will do a lot of mobility using bart and you may 
in san francisco for the fancy food show 2015 as i am not planning to go back there i 
i was quite annoyed when i asked the front desk to call the porter and she answered the p 
our room was on the 24th floor and had a nice view of the bay 
the only down side is you have to pay for internet in non public areas ( eg in your room 
the hotel is what you expect from a famous hotel chain like this 
the butler for your room that can organize anything you want via a simple call 
plus nice local options like greek halva 
the food was also very good 
this is a fantastic hilton property 
a good walk 
comfortable bed and very clean 
nice roof top heated terrace 
my area of greatest concern are the smokers that stand at the top of the stairs outside the front door 
they gave me an room in the ground floor which was big compared to the express standards 
it 's above the financial district 
the staffs were helpful enough to help and carry my bags 
galaxy bar on the roof has a great view 
this would be a great business hotel i feel 
decent sized rooms 
we had complimentary wifi for up to 3 devices and it was very fast 
room was fine and bed was very comfortable 
the facilities are all first rate 
towels are not cleaned up 
location to t5 - short cab ride - 15 pound isn from what i can remember 
the general manager or head of h 
the hotel created a small boardwalk on their section of the beach and wooded bridges over the wide 
really friendly and helpful reception staff 
your average centrally located business hotel 
honestly , i was not looking forward to it . 
this is a great base from where to explore this beautiful and incredibly vibrant city 
the good sized desks had power outlets for one 's gadgets 
if prices stay low i will definitely stay again 
built right on top of the central railway station 
the bathroom was a disaster with peculiar and unwashed stains on the wall near the toilet and the floor 
the reception staff where very friendly and helpful although i did find there was too much of a push to 
the male receptionist was rather offhand 
there are many hotel options in the vicinity of the busy heathrow airport , but premier inn 
marriott biscayne bay is a little dated but overall a comfortable and typical marriott hotel 
however after a good nights sleep in comfortable beds and a hot shower ( plenty of hot water ) 
this was my first time staying at a premier inn and i was impressed by the efficiency of the staff 
one point of note is the hotel hoppa bus service ( not that this is the hotel 's 
well-appointed bathroom with separate shower 
lovely hotel 
and just a 10 minute easy walk to central valletta 
talk about low cost rooms 
aside from the table and chairs the only thing i can complain about is that there was no fresh 
99 - excellent value 
the wifi was very poor and the restaurant food was well below average 
it was up some fairly steep stairs which some people may find challenging with luggage 
1 night parking at the hotel and 2 weeks parking in the long stay car park at heathrow 
had a lovely room on the 9th floor for my one night stay 
just a block off the main street with easy access everywhere 
toilet and bathtub is complete and uses l ccitane shampoo 
the kitchen is great for a light dinner lunch as reykjavik can get very expensive 
little aged but a great propertyvery good breajfast nice suite with huge terrace worth the extra 
my room was like a sauna and the windows do not open 
walkable distance to a number of good restaurants 
but then you would n't be nicely away from the hustle and bustle and it would render 
nice foyer 
the pool is nice ( but unfortunately it closes at 9pm ) and there are some areas with shade 
the pool looked great altho we are not pool people 
room had damp smell 
good connectivity is crucial to business travellers and rubbish wifi in a 5 star hotel is inexcusable 
we dont gamble but took advantage of the wonderful restaurants provided within the complex 
nine times out of ten the first response to anything asked for was no or that will be an additional 
tucked up against the lobby and the street you really do n't expect much but then once seated 
handy to airport and nice location on the river 
spent a total of ten nights at the outrigger reef 
rooms had good amenities and the breakfast was excellent 
no need worry of food as many restaurants nearby 
the bed was ok - i admit not to the taj standards 
it is also on the banks of the swam river and has great access to bike 
the shoe shine station was unmanned for two days and no one knew where the guy was or if he 
facilities are well maintained and room is comfortable 
there are many amenities including room service and on site lounge and restaurant 
all of the windows had a reflective coating on them so you would not have others looking into your room 
it 's very close to things and city center so you can just walk anywhere 
this is a beautiful and classy hotel 
possible to walk via the bellagio to a number of hotels without stepping outside into the heat 
my wife and i agreed that property was ok for price we paid 
fairly quick ( 5 min ) walk to cosmo 
also just up lewers is the canal which is another great spot to run 
great room and great service 
from the 18 night mandatory valet ( no self parking here ) 
no deck chairs available on beach and pool bar is dirty and without service crew 
the kitchenette is a bonus in vegas as hotels do n't always have tea and coffee making 
it is a relatively quiet resort 
really good stay 
comfortable room and nice grounds 
the resort is very nice 
great service 
the rooms are large and spacious with private balcony terrace areas to sit or sunbathe 
the infinity pool was great and made for lovely photos 
the westin is one of my top visited hotels when in sydney 
we stayed 4 days 3 nights and would like to share our experience as a caution 
the first floor restaurant is good for lunch 
we were upgraded to a penthouse suite for the night at no extra charge and the concierge 
we have just spent five enjoyable nights at ayara hilltops in surin beach 
very well equipped goodlife gym in same building with complimentary access for westin guests 
fabulous bed & bedding made it even better 
bed nice 
even with this low price 
the facilities and the service is first class 
citystars shopping centre right next door and all you can want when shopping and some restaurants 
some issues with the toilet flush in my bathroom - kept sticking on 
to check in staff through to room service is always excellent 
good location 
the suite was large and well appointed although it did n't make the best use of the space available 
great food and service 
the hotel continues to serve me well for business and is nicely located right across the street from the conv 
bathroom was huge with a big tub and separate shower roomall in all a great experiance 
non-smoking property - that fact actually made it pretty pleasant and peaceful 
excellent amenities 
i feel that front desk indeed needed to be more diligent and compassionate towards guests who lost important documents and 
lower floors so less wait for a elevator 
when i checked in the agent was so rushed he did n't ask what amenity i would like 
the hotel has a simplistic modern decor and the front desk staff is very helpful 
the bed was very comfy 
clean and spacious 
extremely modern design building 
rooms are spacious and very clean and well presented 
beautifully decorated 
the lobby is plain and there are no door greeters 
huge rooms with great bathroom too 
double sinks and bathtubs 
but the price is still reasonable while most places were sold out 
though being a smallish room the bed was massive and very comfortable 
the pool was lovely and relaxing with a great jacuzzi 
this is an older property serving as a convention destination 
i do n't think you guys do n't see the light of 21st century business practices . 
nice meeting facilities and good banquet food ( substantially better than most ) 
the pool area was too small to accommodate all the guests 
hard to fault the room experience and the bed was extremely comfortable 
we walked several times to circular quay and it was n't bad 
only a short walk away from the noisy 
exit from the airport building and turn right to look for the taxi meter sign 
great rooms with great baths 
it looks like the cleaning and maintenance staff needs to be better instructed or paid better to maintain the property 
ingrid made our stay very special - thank you ingrid 
i dashed over to the business centre in the old part to print off some legal documents 
only minor complaint is that the breakfast selection quality and service is only average 
great location next to the deutsche museum 
if staying close to the town centre is your thingotherwise 
the wifi was sure fast though 
it 's a shared public gym 
no double heavenly shower heads 
it is extremely central with a short walk ( about 25 mins ) to the docks 
complimentary water bottles 
the nikko hotel is near the kanazawa train station and it is an upscale japan 
the lobby is a little less than impressive because of a spiral staircase that not only nullifies any sense 
which was pleasing to use as it had strong water pressure 
great ambiance 
a lot of good restaurants nearby 
modern hotel near station 
attended a conference and the service has deteriorated 
nice amenities and good bathrooms 
aside from the impressive foyer 
convenient and good value 
the lobby is very comfy and spacious with lots of sofas for resting after a long day 
but that they would offer us 2 free drinks each 
quality hotel at a central location in sydney 
when we first showered we ran the shower too fast 
check-in out was quick & front desk staff pleasant 
made worse by its small size 
this marriott is an excellent hotel in a great location in cardiff 
air conditioning too noises . 
this is pure luxury with a wonderful view of marble mountain which is just a 5 minute walk 
nice long bath 
we moved rooms after one night because the room was too hot 
normally i like westin due to their heavenly beds 
- the hotel is very conveniently located in the centre of the city and easy walking distance to various eater 
we ask asked for an ice bucket and they brought us a saucepan filled with ice 
just be aware that even when getting two beds and paying for room with breakfast that if you are over 
most of all we cherished the possibility of opening the windows to get fresh natural air 
the bed was really comfy so settled in for a good nights sleep 
the signal was strong and very good upload download speeds 
good sized bathroom and great service 
had nice apartment suite with big balcony and great views 
my brother and i spoke to many german locals in our few days in town and all said that 
the room was stunning - elegantly appointed 
a separate toilet and modern bathroom and a separate room with double bed 
a big downfall is that if you are on the bottom floor you can hear every noise from upstairs so 
we enjoyed dinner in armade restaurant one night - the food was excellent and the service impeccable 
otherwise they also serve drink in the lobby which was nice 
the adlon is a truly wonderful hotel in by far the best location of any hotel in berlin 
the warm welcome by iman the manager was very much appreciated 
when we got here after having been in key west we felt as if we had chosen the wrong hotel

both mornings were busy and the hotel had not geared up the number of staff required to provide a fully 
i asked for a room on a high floor and got one 
we thought that berlin was a great city and would definitely return to the hotel adlon 
get a room facing the brandenburg gate on the 6th floor you wont be disappointed 
we had a double bed and the springs where very worn out on both sides and was hard to get 
which is worth a visit 
it 's a little dated in decor but the space is fabulous 
ocean is greenish murky and pool water looks dirty 
excellent seafood ( specially the grilled lobster ) at the sirena restaurant under the supervision of chief 
it was an overall positive visit 
you ca n't hardly figure how beautiful is this little property but right away the vintage mercedes enters 
the khmer cuisine at the hotel was excellent ( other options were available 
very peaceful and relaxing stay at shangrila 
looking forward to a la parairie facial at the spa

good airport hotel 
how the work is progressing with the rooms is hard to know when you make your web booking 
this hotel is pretty average what you would expect from radisson 
although it is not along the main white beach of the island 
nice lobby bar with happy hour 
great if you need to be near the airport and the hotel had a complimentary shuttle to the terminals 
the staff at the resort did their best to resolve the issue and move us into the room which we

lagen has a very nice pool 
the restaurants were good and service was warm and friendly 
is providing an excellent global service 
) who will whisk you away on a nature hike that leads to a private beach with hammocks and 
it would have been nice if we had been ferried shortly to the resort 
it 's got a gorgeous lobby with chandeliers 
within walking distance of a number of restaurants and very close to the train station if one desires to visit 
bathroom has separate bath and shower ( the way i like it ) and there is a good flats 
the beach is clean 
the hotel is situated on two stunning beaches and has a large pool area which did get crowded so we 
you should take a boat to the coral gili islands if you want to snorkel or dive 
nice sea view and great pool 
we had all our meals there and they were good and reasonably priced 
higher floors have better views 
food and drink in the hotel is priced at a noticeable premium over similar outside venues 
the cafe closed at 9 
and the bed and pillows were comfy 
great shower and always hot water 
the bathroom was tired and the ceiling looked like it had been badly repaired and never finished 
our room was on the 3rd floor and had a separate sitting area 
the desk staff were very friendly and helpful 
the main lounge is comfortable to sit in and has a large flat screen tv and the staff are particularly 
while these hotel is good value in terms of price i would not stay here again 
taipei 101 is literally across the street and there is a great food court in the first floor 
the hotel is located in a charming old -- but beautifully renovated and restored -- french town house 
high floors have better views 
very close to numerous good restaurants and bars 
the pool and beach area is expansive and we had no trouble finding open chairs at both 
this is an amazing palace and beautiful property to be staying in 
the ceiling is low and the seating arrangement is such that audience behind cannot see the presentation 
on arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to one of their best rooms - it was massive 
grounds are impressive with an open space that is massive 
there are plenty of restaurants in the hotel and the marriott which is connectedi highly recommend this hotel 
an amazing property 
there was no early checkin provided for us and there were no room upgrades 
i ended up paying a lot more for another hotel in the same area 
grand hyatt 's service was excellent and what really stood out was the service by the staff that 
check which floors have completed refurbishment and ensure you will be well away from the disturbance 
were trying to get to the ferry terminal the next morning to meet with the telunas people and 
completely refurbished inside to a very high degree leaving much of the buildings front facade intact blending well into 
they also have free shuttle to the jetty for guests 
nice spacious lobby 
booking was difficult and too many emails were exchanged 
the top floors have a better view over taipei 
n nthe lobby was huge but not impressive 
pepsi and nespresso is a nice touch 
good hotel with full facilities 
great comfortable rooms with all you 'd expect being a 5 star hotel 
we used the great gym where lovely jean-claude gave us a introduction on the equipment 
the lounge on level 22 is excellent and the girls there really know taipei and recommended good safe 
but due to the old carpet 
which is a nice touch 
appreciation also goes to the conceiege roger and alex and the front desk elsie who 
i think overall standard of staff other than in restaurants is very low 
wonderful stay with great service 
i felt like i even had my own privately little beach 
le meridien welcomed us after arrival with a nice fruit cocktail and then we checked in while we 
this is a fantastically good hotel 
we made sure to get value out of that 
recently returned from a stay at this hotel and was very pleased 
the staff is nice and their service is fast 
the surrounding area seem improved tenfold with so many new skyscrapers reaching the building physical height capacity 
breakfast and room expensive 
there 's a convenience store right at the corner with drinks and snacks at prices that will send the 
but if you are there to sightsee this is a great hotel for you 
well appointed and toilets were good 
we were offered complimentary coffee voucher which was nice but the coffee lounge was reserved and the lounge bar closed 
we took a short taxi ride to the hotel 
a lady was there with a sign but then a local car was commissioned which had its book half full 
good value 
room was very clean with fast internet 
that was a nice touch but unfortunately i could not accept the offer as i was heading out for a 
this probably had to do with the fact that the building was originally meant to be an office tower 
two good sized beds 
stops right outside 
the lobby lounge is nice to relax 
the wifi was good 
it has a small fridge in it ( not mini bar ) which was great considering its hot hot hot

returned to the front desk 
while the taxi driver had a little trouble navigating due to traffic 
he wasnt impressed with the size of the room and found the bathroom very small 
arrived late at night car park was full but iain the consierge directed me to a 
great hotel in good location 
the selection is huge and include many items not typically found in most hotel buffet breakfast 
also loved the upstairs pool with its across city views and outside terrace 
the public area are clean and modern and finger print free 
it was of a large size with twin beds which were very comfy and spotless 
we had a large room which was comfortable and clean 
nice audi a6 and good safe drivers 
but after an unsuccessful debate with one front office staff the nice guy who had checked us in took care 
two great nights 
but seemed to weigh light in both rooms- shampoos 
the electronic toilet was totally unnecessary - in fact one is constantly spooked as you enter the stall to 
the bed and pillows were comfortable 
breakfast at adjoining mof restaurant 
i was wary on several bad reviews and i contacted hotel for room arrangements before arriving 
buffet had plenty of options but the food quality was mediocre 
bathrooms were big and kitchen great 
and the shanghai museum is a short taxi ride 
the resort is very well located for the theme parks and outlet shops

plenty of restaurants close by and a supermarket 
the breathtaking lobby with the color-changing staircase 
lovely beds 
a great location near the water with nice size rooms ( i stayed in the apartments at the back of 
the answer from the front desk was that they could come and spray another chemical to try and knock out 
special touches which i appreciated were having tea and water at the hotel lobby for guests 
2 good on site restaurants eateries with good selection of dishes and good wine lists 
concierge very helpful 
comfortable apartment 
most of my meetings were in the financial district in the pudoung area and the location of 
the room itself is great 
whilst the staff are friendly 
filled with amazing artwork and artefacts 
however we do agree with other reviewers that the apartments look like a better bet than the hotel 
we tried to find the swimming pool and was directed to floor 1 but after walking around what was a 
large with a kitchenette 
overall is good hotel in solo if you like javanese style hotel 
not alot here small museum not quite what we expected but ok views good had a coffee at top which 
the gym was quite large but again 
great facilities 
this was a crummy little hotel - the tissue paper in the toilet was not topped up , 
although it is in a busy neighbourhood 
try the hot stones options 
thai green curries in coconuts etc - fab cocktails - some amazing styled restaurants with ponds 
hotel has a safety facility at night and requires a access card to enter after the reception and hotel 
we stayed one night while transitting through perth 
i read various reviews and picked this hotel as it was convenient for transport and being near to the not

we got a great deal and it was just excellent value

the room safe was locked ( although i did n't really need it ) and the smoke detector was 
japanese options 
a small tesco convenience store and a couple of banks ( for your atm and foreign exchange 
our room on the 4th floor was quite nice 
it did not happen and although you hardly can fault the place with large rooms and city views 
there was a constant rattling noise throughout the night 
lots of restaurants and attractions all in easy walking distance 
the shower was difficult to set on warm water - the kids are sensitive to hot water 
the bed was comfortable and the room and hotel were very clean and well presented 
the hotel has a large swimming pool and a private beach below 
with good quality furnishings that are functional rather than luxurious 
the public areas are nice 
this area opened out onto a pleasant terrace 
it has a small balcony and look at the ocean and also have a television area with comfy so 
the hotel also has double glazed windows over the balcony so you wont be disturb by any road noise 
rooms are clean and refurbish

n ngreeted by very pleasant staff and very pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded to 'half t 
the sitting area was nice when we all wanted to be in one room to watch a movie or decide 
parking is free to so makes the whole trip easy 
the suite is spacious with a large but dated master bathroom and a second half bathroom 
friendly staff who provided an excellent service combined a good food makes a difference for the convention 
visit the roof top bar for the best views of malaga and surroundings great drinks not too expensive 
only thing would be nice if the hotel provided free shuttle to the city centre for guests 
high floor with a view of the sea 
have a pizza baked in the outdoor oven and drink a local beer 
bar is fun in the evening although double the price of all bars in the area 
there was enough space to do work 
at the end the request was ignored but the street noise was not that bad even on the weekendi 
sits between the main coast road and one of the most beautiful series of sandy beaches imaginable 
the entrance is open to a upscale shopping street that carries a large selection of brand name stores 
there are 2 large and excellent pools

dinner that night was the worst food we had in sri lanka 
stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in sept 2009 
room clean and a reasonable size for one night 
centrally located for old city and independence square 
the front desk was efficient and friendly 
good breakfast spread 
we have booked this resort through expedia and although i have read all reviews about the hotel be frank 
dining options nearby is good 
then the occupant has to climb over the bath to dry oneself 
would definitely return for an airport hotel 
the suites are luxurious in every sense and worth springing the extra for 
the kettle kept on going off of its own accord and the razer point only seemed to work for 
and most importantly a quiet nights sleep . 
great layout 
great price 
since we were in such high floor 
the reception staff are helpful and friendly 
i had a beautiful balcony 
our 2 bedroom apartment was located on the 14th floor 
will definitely return for its old world charm 
brilliant views and good facilities 
have stayed at q1 in the past but found the views impeded by another hotel a little disappointing 
a short business trip turned into a fantastic 18 hour treat for me 
if you get a great price 
except the mattress was too firm and the duvet and pillows artificial - but all a matter of 
the way to go pick the executive rooms all you have come to expect from novotel and 
decided to check in first before dinner with my team and i asked the check in staff if the 
traders hotel is n't the most modern hotel in penang but it 's been refurbished 
breakfast spread is good 
one of the best hotels 
we drop off the luggages and then go out immediately 
friendly staff and very helpful 
the room is spacious and the bed is soft ( just nice ) 
the hotel is undergoing renovation and there 'll be some noise during 9am - 6pm 
however if staying there - one must visit the panorama bar on the 33 floor - it has 
water pressure excellent 
the lounge is nice with cocktail hour 5 tom9 pm 
there was free wifi in the rooms and connectivity was good 
nice front desk service but strict check in at 3 pm 
nibbles in executive lounge ok - you 'll find something you like 
a bit old in the bathroom section but still a good place to stay in penang close to any 
the rooms are very well fit out and high quality 
breakfast aside the lobby was good but they did n't change many things from day to day 
all the staff in the lounge is very good 
my room was clean and smoke free and comes with high speed wifi 
the hotel is brand new and the facility is excellent 
so its easily brushed asidethe club lounge was great 
sheraton has a better thread count ( than other comparable hotels ) in their sheets and pillow cases 
bathroom had lots of lovely thick towels and plenty of water pressure 
carpet is old 
hotel jen is a short 5 minute walk from the edge of george town and there are 
the hotel has no direct access from the main street 
our late arrival became blessings in disguise as our rooms were all ready by the time we checked in 
it means a taxi ride into the city first 
front desk staff was good 
if you want to pay a good price and stay in a very decent hotel 
good rooftop spa 
amenities and general ambience are of a good quality 
the chinese restaurant is definitely worth a visit 
and the dinner at the red cafe either with the bar menu or the restaurant menu equally good 
the resort is good and is said to be 5 stars but not sure it is really 
very nice internal swimming pool 
because i use it for late arrivals and early departures 
the staffs are very polite and efficient during checking in and out 
this hotel is near to many famous hawker food and quaint cafes 
such a shame because lounging by the pool with a drink is an amazing treat 
on special deals rooms go for under 100 and normally are in the 100-150 price range 
bed was comfortable and furniture appears to have been recently refreshed 
the wifi was pretty good 
the thick windows seemed to block the airport noise very well 
but i would prefer something closer to the beach and george town 
the bathroom was clean and the shower was warm 
the holiday inn is excellent value for money 
if you want higher quality piece of meat or seafood 
you have instant access to the pools & beach from the open balcony of your room 
the free wifi is limited to two hours 
to have good golf 
and this must be one of the tallest buildings in melaka 
though it was a short stay for us 
it was a nice touch ( see the photo for reference ) the trio band singers on a night were 
it couldnt be better located for travel in and out of pearson - and though the lobby is 
to use the sauna is an extra 540 per person 
room was good sized and big enough even for 8-9 of my friends to come and visit me 
i do n't look for much in an airport hotel - but straightforward-ness ( such as an 
extremely convenient good quality airport hotel 
online booking is a pain with this hotel 
it was a nice spread with japanese and western foods 
the swimming pool itself is a masterpiece 
its also near large malls if shopping is what you like to do 
choice of firm of soft pillow already set out on the bed is a nice touch 
the higher floor the better view 
the swimming pool is worth a visit just to marvel at it 
a full kitchen and butler to go along with the room 
it has a rotten smell that we did not dare to approach to eat anything for safe and need to 
decent hotel , but really pathetic staff we arrived just around 2 pm for the check-in , 
rooms are very good and the food is excellent overall it is the best choice in riyadh 
good but needs service improvment i stayed in this hotel 8 nights . 
we had a nice visit 
great service 
location is great ( midtown ) 
i 'm not going to spend time talking about the type of neighbors i had during my last trip 
still the best in toronto 's big hotels 
this hotel is right on the edge of the pitvice lakes national park and you can just walk right 
the bedroom had a nice super big bed with access to one bathroom and the other bathroom was next to 
i started the stay by checking in at 3pm ( it said check-in time starts at 
buffet breakfast in same room is also great with multiple choices 
there are two computers with free internet access just off the main lobby by the gift shop 
feels like a mountain retreat but it 's right in the city 
a famous must see grand old hotel 
the rooms are a good size and the location is convenient but i found the rooms not as pristine and 
the staff were very helpful 
we went to the bar at the lobby a couple of times and the drinks were great - i forgot 
breakfast was nice also 
i particularly enjoy the feeling as though i 'm staying in private residence area which is quiet yet so 
comfortable open spaces 
walking distance to anywhere you need including the biggest shopping area central world 
the lobby bar has nightly live performance - again a kudo that boutiques do n't generally offer 
positive responses from the private butler who wrapped flowers and packed cake for us 
you have to do it but just realize its going to cost you 
breakfast items were tasty and made-to-order eggs benedict was fresh 
the bed is amazingly comfortable and the bathroom out of this world 
the bathroom is tiny and you have to step around the door closing it before you can sit on the 
but even in that we learned that you can get vastly different quality depending who was at the front desk 
position of the hotel is ideal although in the centerit is peaceful and not a bustling busy hotela 
which was superb with great service on the mezzanine 
iconic and spectacular one of the best hotel in the world where staff exceed each second your expectations . 
good hotel with good location and courteous staff 
beer and snacks unhand for free- nice touch 
each time it is about the same experience - the good stays good and the bad does n't improve 
the rooms are old 
although they were running at high occupancy 
the room was ok although nothing special . 
at night the bar has a happy hour with good quality cocktails and wine - 2 for the price of 
we did go to the long bar to have a singapore sling - this is a tourist attraction with 
the singapore slings were extortionately priced but what is annoying is the reception you get which ex 
it is a very tastefully done facility with amazing breakfasts restaurants ( eve is rated number 62 
clean comfortable and easy access to tube station 
room on the 6th floor - very quiet and a large room 
this hotel is an overall wonderful experience 
that it 's only a short walk 
th only issue with the hotel is the noise 
beware of expensive coffee should you just wish to sit near reception 
we a bit regret on this since we wanted to spend our last 3 nights in bangkok laying at 
the bathrooms are huge and the addition of towel hooks and a nonslip mat has been noted and is 
how can any one who is supposed to be customer facing tell you firstly that breakfast was cold because 
on our departure one of our friend left his ipad in the lobby 
and the second time i was on the 4th floor which i found to be noisy with the balcony 
amazing coffee that they grow and roast themselves 
in a city like this one 
it appeared that there are 2 teams the locals and the expats 
downtown crossing area noisy and busy 
the lower lobby 
between the two comfortable chairs 
one of the best hotels i stayed so far 
the round sofa has a remote control to auto rotate it 
the bar and disco are worth visiting if you are intereted 
some nice touches 
and walk straight ahead along orchard road until you find the singapura shopping center on the left 
the location is excellent and you to walk to almost all the landmarks 
good location , but that 's it pros- good location right on orchard roadcons- feels 
the staff were friendly 
the free internet is fast enough even for streaming video ( tho' not hd ) 
the package for an executive floor room sans the usual amenities was great value-fcor-money 
i will say that this property was great 
great room 
were always working and we never had a situation where we had a long wait 
amenities and had a great breakfast buffet 
polite helpful staff 
breakfast good but lacked cereals 
the hotel concierge were great and really helpful in suggesting local places to eat and a thing bars 
i stayed here one night and the hotel is in the same building as a macys 
the service is very slow in everything 
in the bar i received and observed equally excellent service from tommy 
the ritz will price match any hotel booking site and add extras so always worth calling their reservations line 
the first floor rooms with private terrace overlooking swimming pool is a real luxury one can enjoy the barbecue 
had a very memorable time staying at the ritz london 
a great old world hotel with impeccable service 
this is a good business hotel and will definitely be back 
the front desk are always so charming and helpful 
the breakfast room was great for a morning meeting but slightly too formal had we been there for leisure purposes 
adjoining a modern shopping mall 
amazing and the breakfast 
the hotel facilities are also great and services is second to none 
good location ( shopping mall on your door step ) and good standard of room 
the food and bars are wonderful and the service is first class across all aspects of the hotel 
the lobby and dining areas are lovely - very classic in style - but well lighted and pleasant 
from the very first moment we arrived we were treated like vips 
i suppose that even as a frequent user of hotels a visit to the ritz london is a 
the bed big and comfortable 
the decor in some areas does look like a palace ( nothing you have n't seen ) but the 
the return back to normal was seamless and staff were calm and organised 
the marriott is located on the outskirts of edinburgh close to the airport 
the location of this hotel is ideal for visiting all of scotland and coming back to a wonderful 
the gentleman on reception ( fluent in english and french ) - from the nl 
water saver shower was strong though for some reason the sink faucet was weak 
with an amazing swimming pool 
the security guard near the elevators was nice since he did actually check that people had room keys before 
the shower and bathtub are right next to the windows making it very romantic if with your significant other 
the views from the 100 th floor are breathtaking as is the building in general 
on-site market was fine for choice and small meals if needed 
the shower had great water pressure with hot-hot-hot water ( which i loved ) 
amazing shower tub 
many good restaurants nearby to choose from 
based on my last visit 
the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spacious and had everything i needed 
nice property at a great price 
i had to make a target run and walked there in less than 10 minutes 
the hotel staff is always ready to help anywhere in the hotel 
the lobby was big and very festive with so many people 
a lovely corner room on the 19th floor with awesome views of dtla and hollywood ( 
valet parking was excellent but it cost more to park for 3 hours than it did for overnight 
the hotel is in a great location and the staff is generally nice 
overall there were so many other issues that bothered me like my dry cleaning not being returned on time 
but you can easily take a tuk-tuk to that area which is around 5 minutes away 
the room is cute and neat in teak wood 
the hotel is very nice and very well located right in the middle of the staple center and la live 
location is top notch - in the heart of everything downtown 
my first trip to japan and first stop was a night stay at yokohama before heading 
which also connected to various malls and department stores 
the main benefit of this hotel is that it is close to the railway station and you can walk there 
but did n't have enough space to open both of them at same time ) other than that it 
i stayed at this property for one night and had an enjoyable experience 
they just assume there is only one airport hotel run by doubletree 
breakfast buffet is varied and the dinner buffet was delicious and with lots of varieties 
he displayed some unusual behavior which went unnoticed by the front desk 
the wifi is free at this property 
nice airport hotel 
but to take a cab elsewhere from the hotel is a killer 
the hotel has a high standard of guest services 
they can be quite noisy with the traffic and also a parade at 7 
the hotel still very nice 
i had high expectations for this hotel as i needed a place to stay near the airport since i had 
they have very nice afternoon tea 
the night market is nearby and around the area 
but the large patio doors onto small balcony are not completely sound proof 
it is in georgetown close to great restaurants 
one on a higher floor with view to the pool 
there are several metro stops nearby 
the swimming pool and the restaunrant are all beautiful 
- a burger special ( chicken 
the room on the starwood preferred guest floor were large 
room size is good for 2 
the hotel entrance and public areas look grand but the room was a let down 
i was on the 6th floor and i just cleared the building adjacent to the westin so i 
this resulted in long queues 
extraordinarily for such a big and busy property 
we had booked ourselves into a little 3 star hotel 10 minutes walk away and then moved to the mar 
( 2 ) western food restaurant is average 
given the limited facilities in the lounge for serving breakfast 
only available free of charge to all at the lobby 
no need to write about full amenities 
the cocktails and the meals were prepared and delivered with great care and pride 
oddly the door to the shower and the toilet were the same sliding door and if you wanted complete 
we dined at the restaurant every day for breakfast and dinner - very impressed with the chinese restaurant 
expecting this sheraton to be in the same league as a sheraton in an international city is 
the airport is about one hour and a half distance in a mountain road 
and a thousand buses into the town 's small streets 
i would understand if the slippers were made of leather ( like in a lot of japanese 
surrounded by good catalan restaurants 
we stayed here two nights while visiting the amazing jiuzhai valley nature reserve in late june 
the park was close by and the staff had some good tips about how best to explore 
after staying one night at another hotel in chiang mai we moved to the chedi as 
the room overlooked some noisy equipment on the roof of an adjacent hotel building 
the rows of suitcases in the lobby and the frequent comings and goings of large tour groups 
a lovely setting 
nice pool and sun lounging area round the back to chill and watch the soaring kites or 
pleasant and attentive reception that attended to our requests a staff who looked like he was working under the security 
good ambiance 
the wet area was poor 
we had stayed in over forty hotels in the previous six months and this was one of only three worldwide 
n nrestaurants and bars nthere are 2 restaurants and 2 bars - fire is an excellent 
this is a great place to stay and very near to cp 
the small shower was very slippery with a stained shower mat 
and at arrival i asked fro my minibar to be cleaned out so i can stock it with 
one comment on the decor - whoever did the last renovation should have been fired - you have this classic 
an excellent stay in the center of new delhi and very convenient for it 's close proximity to 
they have a good gym and outdoor heated pool as well 
rooftop pool is nice but it was too cold for sunbathing when i was there ( 
that 5 star feeling somehow is missing but overall a nice place to be 
so i went down to the main 24 7 restaurant on the ground level and found it absolutely packed 
always have a room above the 13 floor or facing the front of the hotel or else you will be 
the bedroom was clean 
so if i left the curtains open 
a beautiful historic building featuring an unparalleled private collection of several thousand pieces of artwork 
the room was spacious and very comfortable 
look forward to my next visit 
decided to try the imperial due to the elegant colonial atmosphere and the good location for walking around 
8th floor is great 
it was an interior room and the sole window looked into a lobby 
the room was fine 
enough electrical outlets 
excellent restaurants with fantastic food 
the beds were very comfortable and everything was in good working order 
however there is a decent sitting area with a full 3-seater couch and a single couch 
spice restaurant good but a c ice cold 
all the areas are delightful and we dined at the italian restaurant and the spice route 
and reasonable value 
quite a nice property with access nearby to connaught place and also bengali market

there is a great rooftop bar and restaurant and great views across madrid 
the grand 1911 bar has been turned into a sports bar 
the friendly and efficient staff 
get a room facing the canal . 
the roof top bar is amazing and madrid is one of europe 's finest cities 
) the king-sized bed too firm for our taste 
best stay in delhi so far quick review today , i stayed 2 nights on business at the imperial 
the design and decor of the hotel is great and fashionable 
you can walk everywhere in the old part of madrid and if you need the subway it is only 
the staff were extremely helpful and friendly 
nice decor 
the lounge breakfast was great 
ottoman - they have a small couch with a black oval ottoman that is heavenly to 
its a great property and but its important to choose your time of going there 
but the mobile networks are rather poor in rooms 
the all round quality of the hotel is excellent and it has a nice pool 
crown plaza is a very nice hotel in downtown santiago 
wet bar 
nibbles and light refreshments throughout the day 
the only downside were the slow lifts 
great location and big rooms 
our aircon was n't very good however and the room was hot throughout our stay 
the hotel is well located in the centre 
excellent location - walking distance to shopping and food . 
two weddings going on with all the associated crazy and tourists completely under foot 
set right on several tram lines 
newish lobby 
the place is usually packed with groups so the attention span of waiters is also limited 
there was a great restaurant over the road from the hotel 
the pool is strictly for lounging in and not for serious lap swimmers 
the pool area is quite nice and lrge but i could n't understand why they had this 
breakfast was good and the breakfast staff were polite 
same beds 
amazing property with great grounds 
service and food was top notch and the club had a really good selection in the evening 
this is a wonderful property in perfect location with a highly motivated staff 
it was close to the centre of town and right next door to a pub restaurant 
good value 
the carpet was so deep stained and the walls so battered i could n't help but feel uncomfortable anywhere 
walking distance to central and 4 taxi to old town 
one can walk directly from the main street which is easier or get there from the underground train station as 
and free drinks including alcohol 
really good property 
the staff is formal yet friendly and the rooms are great 
the mercure centrum is well located opposite stalin 's wedding cake and also the central station 
breakfast in exec lounge is ok - similar to most marriott 's - but the gal tending 
it 's the closest on site hotel to the parks and citywalk - just a short walk or 
great outdoor area with huge pool 
delightful , inspiring , comfortable , amazing value i ca n't wait to come back and will stay longer 
in both selection is not quite big and breakfast in the kitchen is more regular than acceptable . 
but the bare lounge still leaves me baffled 
the other disappointing feature is their roof top pool 
missing the personal touch 
definitely worth staying at 
there 's a conference center next door 
although there have been other comments about the lack of a 7 11 or convenience stores nearby 
there is a nice terrace on the roof with a dipping pool 
there are 1 or 2 tailors in town should you need to get a suit dress made 
if you are looking for good value 
this stay was definitely not consistent with the mo brand which is typically 5 star 
dipping pool is pretty but really should be a real pool instead of what it is 
the bar staff were excellent too 
very luxurious property but just really poor value 
our request for a late check-out on departure was n't dealt with sympathetically either - 
extended waits past check-in time for rooms to be cleaned and ready and forgotten requests for things 
the rooms are average size with small bathrooms 
they charge a daily resort fee that includes access to the pool and hot tub 
but drank in the bar -- very expensive but pleasant 
this property is a bit dated and the walls have some skuf marks on them throughout the property 
we were staying for five nights and the location was ideal for us 
which gives easy access to other areas of the city 
the wireless access was hassle free and the location is very central to all the restaurants and shopping in downtown 
the pool area is very clean and modern 
that aside the location is perfect for visiting all the main tourist attractions and the metro is a hundred meters 
reception area is closer to arrival departure point 
due to the building of a new road choose a room with pool or marina views 
standard rooms are nicely decorated and well cleaned - just watch out on connecting rooms and if you pay for 
some nice restaurants outside the hotel and a good coffee shop - just a couple of minutes walk which are 
30am and check out was painless and the ride to the airport was fast at that hour 
the pool on the sixth floor is really beautifull and provides you the area to chill out 
the perfect stay 
after staying several days at hilton colombo did not like the ozo 's hospitality 
there is n't a lot of shops and good eateries nearby 
it makes much more sense to ask the receptionist to get you a normal taxi instead 
the food was excellent and the children 's menu varied and interesting 
we had to sleep with a football-sized lump up our back and i was lucky enough to be 
the pool was wonderful and always clean 
wifi is good breakfast not so great 
you are next to a bustling little hamlet 
the room service menu is great and we absolutely enjoyed the infinity pool and the the private beach 
yet only 15 minutes from the airport for you to stay until the last minute 
the views marvelous and beds very comfortable 
with both a walk-in shower and a large tub 
we had a room with a view of the river and the pool which was like a one bedroom apartment 
basically the size of a very large studio apartment 
could be a nice accomodation option in munich if the hotel management can get their act 
where the balcony is decent for you to spend time there with a book and drink 
from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave you will be happyfriendly staff to the limits and 
they are warm and friendly and treat customers like they are important 
the rooms are large & comfortable 
super clean and spacious 
the bathroom was huge with a big bathtub and a massive walk-in shower with a rain- 
despite that i highly recommend the chatrium - it 's excellent value and an super location 
the breakfast option was very good and the free shuttle service was regular 
if you are there on a sunday the brunch is a must 
the gift shop prices were very high 
shekou down the road and easy access to futian 
still one of the best options in shenzhen 
the river barge was really pleasant to eat it 
king bedded room on a high floor and was assigned a southwest facing room with a view of lots 
love the 2 different firmness of pillow available in the room 
but dining options looked good but bangkok hotel rather than local prices 
it was difficult to get taxis due to the location in general 
avoid the over priced breakfast and get yourself over to honey honey ( see separate review ) 
got a free upgrade to bellagio lake suite on last floor 
this hotel is a good option if you driving into kl from the north-south highway 
really nice space 
as i usually checkin and returned late 
the buffet is one of the better ones in lv 
it was really beautiful and nice decorated 
great shopping mall connected 
staff friendly and helpfull 
the reception area is so dark you can hardly see even during the day but the concierge desk 
that said the cocktails were really good but also very pricey 
though fairly typical i believe of all strip hotels - long check-in queues 
you are just two steps away from jumping into the awesome pool with super jacuzzi jets 
the hotel is located in the business district of sf 
the gym is good and and clean 
the bar and restaurant have a great buzz at night 
stayed at ph for the weekend and moved to another hotel 3 nights later 
low ceiling and shiny black tiles 
decor was fine for the common areas ( e 
superb location and the gordon ramsey burger restaurant was pretty good 
front desk was great - the front drive people need a bit of work but they are working hard in 
the outside terrace is off limits 
but within easy walking distance of the most important museums ( van gogh 
we waited long for wine as well 
the owner could n't see what the problem was with our complaint ! 
very good bed 
breakfast was always good and was the wine at night 
the location is around the corner form aa local mall great location 
there are many new and great hotels that have come to santiago in the last ten years but 
this is a very nice boutique hotel 
various restaurants 
breakfast lovely and service was excellent throughout the hotel 
the staff are friendly and the concierges super helpful 
very happy stay 
beautiful lobby 
wifi was an extra cost at 25 a night 
the bikes from the hotel were fantastic 
diagonally across from the hotel is a new shopping mall that has some nice restaurants 
expect portions about 1 3-1 2 the size of what you would get n a us sher 
two potential guests were not disturbing the hotel 
simple menu and the setting is very pleasant 
at the adult pool i asked for times of the train back and was given totally wrong information by the 
another will ignore your weak attempts to get a cup of coffee at breakfast- amazing secluded beach 
however the rooms are clean and comfortable 
our room was a good size nice bathroom and balcony only thing missing was a iron and board essential items 
the beach is a public beach - so be ready for a busy weekend at the beach 
the hotel is historic and has a lot of old world charm and character while still being up to date 
the art suites were great to look at but given that you only sleep from 11 to 7 in the 
you can book online for a flybus transfer from the ryanair airport to the city centre and 
the rooms were very warm so much so we had to sleep with the windows open 
the menu offered in the lounge is very limited 
its on a pedestrian street 
the hotel is right in the middle of town with the tram stop just outside of the doors 
i recommend the hotel tour included i the price of your stay and the talk on 'surviving 
the front desk were very helpful in all matters 
housekeeping is either run as a joke by students on the entertainment committee from the local college or the 
at busier times there is a choice of restaurants including an open kitchen 
only one night here - i 'd love to have been able to stay longer 
very convenient location ( 8 min to foggy bottom-gwu subway ) 
the menu is varied and the service really professional and friendly 
the walk to the metro ( s ) was n't too bad ( though a bit annoying if you 
- great 3-course dinner with port compliment 
the the room is bit larger than other hotels 
good living and bedroom space with nice modern colors and big flat screen tvs 
hotel facilities were great if you do not want ot eat in hotel then you will need to go 
the shower 's water pressure was wonderful 
londons second airport 
so minimalist that they pushed the sleekness up to doorless bathroom giving full view on your neighbo 
the lobby is nice 
we rode a cab from the airport direct to the hotel door for 7 euro 
decent wifi 
there is one indoor pool and another outdoor pool 
the staffs were quite friendly 
) the breakfast room is nice and the selection is decent - with your standard international breakfast fayre 
the bed and the room in general was very comfortable 
this gave us plenty of time to settle into our room ( select an airport facing one if possible ) 
i have no time to use any of hotel facilities and i am happy to come back at the next 
but sofitel really should be more attentive and have better quality food 
yet hotel is a bit old and outdated but the staff really try to make up for it with a 
a thick duvet ( think uk winter duvet ) really is n't necessary 
so only one type of rooms exists ( although the website might give a different feeling - suites are available 
the room was very hot and uncomfortable 
but quite basic being decorated in all white 
the fitness room and pool however are large and very well equiped 
we got a cold towel and a welcome drink and where guided to our room right away 
plus complimentary water bottles 
buffet is excellent quality but as in china hard if you are a vegetarian since everything they mix 
only if i absolutely needed to be near the airport before an early flight 
with excellent coffee available during the day 
especially 7 eleven to get extra drinks 
also it is located on the best huge white beach 
a little overpriced as you would expect to be honest but food and service were great 
check -in was swift with friendly reception staff 
excellent and good prices 
if you are an early riser though there are only slats on the bathroom window that lights up 
nice bar areas and helpful staff-recommended 
excellent mattresses quietcons 
that is what an airport hotel is all about - being able to sleep well 
we have stayed at the d'oreale grand a number of times over the years ( including most 
one of the best hotels i have stayed in - i highly recommend it 
room service was super-fast and i had a great night 's sleep 
convenient hotel 
my room was quiet and spotless 
- anthill-alike hotel- small rooms- terrible interior- poor in-room amenities- 
i did visit the exec lounge on the 8th floor and this was very good with lovely service 
decent super convenient airport hotel 
the room , service , check-in , food every thing much below the taj standards . 
good airport hotel with direct link to terminal 
this is on the whole an excellent airport hotel option 
look for signs saying 'south gate' as the hotel is not mentioned on all signs and this is 
despite the branding this is a good basic airport hotel 
it is a busy location and the hotel lobby is very busy too as there are several good restaurants also 
they gave me a free breakfast voucher to compensate that 
stayed with friends in a club room for one night before our holiday together 
hyatt cityhouse restaurant tony , the cityhouse chef , was great . 
the car park is close by and there is a slick check in 
the sheraton club is above average and the gym is very well equipped with both machines and free weights 
the hotel is so close to north terminal we dropped our bags at ba fast bag drop then went back 
but this property needs refurbishment- brasserie very good dinner choices but fairly expensive- lounge offers reasonably 
dont stay here if you are two 
go for the junior suite you will not regret it 
taxi from the airport is about 45 us 
roomy lobby with bar and very good restaurant ( which is important as there seems to be a de 
we landed in nice and the plan was to take the train straight to monte carlo and the 
higher floors give better view 
it was an easy walk to the train station and the rest of monaco 
the location is perfect 
easy access and helpful valet service if you drive 
first impressions are good - it doesnt seem to have a clear reservation desk but the staff were great and 
ask the concierge staff ( who speak excellent english ) to direct you to the new supermarket which 
do n't expect it 's of the same quality as other four seasons in the world like h 
which made for an easy trip to the track 
staff were amazing and helpful 
i do n't agree with the excellent ratings this hotel has received from other posters 
tastefully decorated and impeccably clean 
even room service was delicious 
the location is not the best but still easy to get to the city center as the metro station and 
and a separate bedroom ensuite 
other meals are available and good 
friendly service 
we stayed one night last week and another this week 
turns out only the lobby bar is open 
having the paddling pool right next to it ( without any partitions ) also meant that i 
free internet only if you sign up to the hilton group 
it has a nice pool 
a short trip to petra is a must although the 600 steps up the hill there are a killer 
service is fantastic from manager and especially all the pool men and the people at the beach 
the table was ready as expected 
the top floor ishtar superior room was great 
pick a villa if you want to be by the pool 
we were offered a very noisy delux room due to lift noise which did not become apparent until bed 
my first impression was that the foyer was dated and the hotel layout a little sprawling 
floating on the dead sea is a not to be missed experience and there is a lovely beach 
my last stay in this hotel was at 2011 
flush toilets when you need to 
also i went to the spa and the treatment was incredible 
the resort is very good and is proximal to the beach with good walking tracks nearby 
chic design in all public areas will make you drool 
the hotel is in a lovely setting and is beautifully designed 
poor location and sad staff 
close to the main train station and the staff were fantastic 
we booked a candlelit table positioned on the edge of the infinity pool which overlooked the sea and we 
ok - a bit tired perfectly functional for a couple of days on business - but not a hotel i 
rooms are spacious and very well designed with a private balcony ( i believe all the rooms have a sea 
there are several shops 
design was cool and everything was flawless . 
toilet room is separated from the bathroom 
good location 
the ceilings are low and they have so many mirrors in the hallways that it 's odd 
good gym and indoor heated pool 
the bathroom had a very nice rainfall showerhead and all of the expected amenities 
nearly a gift in central city 
the cocktails in the lobby bar were great and the lobby restaurant was delicious 
i look forward to coming and staying again 
however whilst the hotel has all the amenities and services you would want 
the bed was great with nice linens on it 
being a luxurious resort they should take care of their guests better 
lovely birthday experience special attention for birthday dinner was perfect to complement a short weekend break in cameron 
the staff was helpful and friendly and the cleaning service was excellent 
including my husband banging his head in the town and the staff could n't have been more helpful or 
there are several excellent restaurants in the hotel and also a fabulous patisserie called coco 
stayed one night on my last visit to queenstown 
this had a full kitchen 
which has a nice balcony 
my only criticism of the accommodation is that the one bathroom was very small and not very functional for four 
you have to be prepared for falling debris and minor landslides and washouts 
what buged us was that in the reservation it said free upgrade 
it was a really special honeymoon experience 
us top quality bliss bathroom amenities 
it would of been expensive to eat meals here otherwise 
respecting the historical building and style yet providing all the modern facilities 
very nice decor 
the spa at the resort is surprisingly good as well and if you are looking for a relaxing treatment 
the staff is super professional and makes check-in a breeze 
great location and very good hotel 
indoor swimming pool is nice in summer ( in addition to the outdoor one ) 
very friendly staff 
providing a lovely walk of maybe a mile 
limited free parking is available 
the quality of food ( for breakfast , afternoon tea and dinner ) was excellent too . 
service is top notch and most of all choices of restaurants are superb 
price is to high 
decor wise in my opinion its kinda old pool and beach are amazing 
renovated rooms with nice amenities 
bathroom had excellent toiletries and the rainfall shower head was divine 
harbour and business and the citadel monument 
we were there for 3 nights and the sheets and pillow cases remained consistently crumpled 
the hotel offers a outstanding swimming pool and a magnificent spa 
the location is also good for shopping to mira mall that is connected from the hotel 
thank you to the four seasons for calling a taxi for us when we found the metro station close to 
from the airport we got the train to kowloon station ( approx 30 mins ) and the free 
i mean you would n't expect a bigger room in a four-star airport hotel 
the staff are very good 
the hotel has a continental style breakfast that starts at 4am which is good if you an early flight 
what an absolutely amazing area 
no wonder we came back for an early flight after our december visit 
very good central location in kowloon 
clean and good value 
pre dinner started with a person playing the bagpipes and summoning guests to the pre-dinner 
next door is the one shopping centre - very good but even better is the mirador shopping centre which 
rooms are generally small 
near the club lounge always had a bad smell to it 
we got upgraded luckily and the room is surprisingly spacious 
i stayed there for just one night aiming to use the outdoor swimming pool and the gym 
the room is reasonable but at the moment they have constuction work on going 
you can actually check in your luggage 
the hotel was wonderful with excellent amenities 
the last 3 stays 
while this hotel is a little pricey it is one of the best places to stay while in hong 
got changed and jumped in after a long hot flight 
the hotel was amazing enough to let me use their laptops for the entire duration of my stay on top 
we then raised this issue with the front desk and eventually the toy was located and returned after 2 days 
transfers between areas can be done through golfcarts or your own bike assigned upon arrival 
huge comfortable king beds 
front desk and room service staff were also friendly and helpful 
2 full days was enough for me and i felt quite detoxed and yearning for a large steak 
you can find good street food there 
a warm soak in an outdoor tub filled with pure coconut milk ( special tea served ) 
the property is large and their landscaping is very well maintained 
the inside has a kind of old world charm and the rooms are generous proportions but my experience was tainted 
pool area is nice 
they also had vending machines for sandwiches and drinks ( alcoholic and non-alcoholic ) 
the room itself was a good size with a really large bathroom with big bath shower - bed was very 
the buffet breakfast was also great with a good variety of options 
the gym was again old but worked fine with a very good range and good spa area with sauna 
and it was good in all respects - such as the very comfortable bed - although my wife does n 
the pool is good sized and children enjoy it very much 
this is a very comfortable and well maintained property - the room product is very good ( looks like it 
staff were friendly and the wifi was working well 
the staff are all very friendly and helpful 
separate shower 
rooms are comfortable and well equipped with nice touches such as uk us and european plug points 
its located on the harbour front but besides a huge mall which can keep you occupied if you feel bored 
large lobby- gorgeous 
and they would send someone over to get us - the hotel is only minutes from the terminal 
the bathroom was decent enough and bath products are standard radisson products 
stay here if you are on a stopover and have a flight the next day 
i think a hotel of this stature could invest in flat screen tv 's 
mutiara is located next to an old mall which sells a lot of gadget accessories at really cheap 
i used their 5-minute free shuttle service and then took the airport express to downtown seoul on 
the minibar setup was nice 
not everything worked perfectly - the doors did not shut on their own and the internet was problematic , 
large bath 
the hotel 's close proximity to the mall made errands and shopping very convenient 
king bed and extra large shower 
the rooms are spacious and clean 
the hotel lobby is impressive and provides an excellent first impression of things to come 
only issue was that front desk staff are pretty clueless 
there is a convenient store across the street and it 's easy to wave down a taxi in front 
a pretty new hotel in the area and very nearby subway station 
good buffet restaurant and lobby 
the lobby and the restaurant areas are airy and with high ceilings and very pleasant 
i got a business room where access to the business lounge is available 
our room was big and bed was perfect 
rooms are clean and big enough and specially the bed it is huge and comfortable 
the lobby was huge and check in took a bit longer than usual although not the fault of the hotel 
elegant lobby with restaurants 
on a thursday night there were only a couple tables open ( blackjack 
or maybe its because the room given is in a different category . 
roomthe hotel is split into two towers east and west 
not bad price ) 
modern and clean and excellent value 
the evening offerings at the business lounge were terrifically tasty and the drink selection equal to the test 
an enjoyable stay and would use again 
the prices are incredibly low and taxis are cheap 
the only small comment i will make is that as a gold member i was expecting free breakfast or bonus 
the hotel has its own gym and guests have access to a connecting fitness club 
this will be my new go to property in denver 
great amenities 
the floor had its own dedicated housekeeping and there is a turndown service 
the downtown denver ritz carlton is a great property 
the boat trip from male airport so quick and easy 
nice location but noisy room 
actually the entire staff was very special amir our housekeeper 
the room was spacious and service good 
breakfast was excellent and the location is good also 
well maintained and generous sized rooms 
another great deal from groupon 7 days pool view deluxe room on top floor 
bed is very comfortable 
the staff are very helpful and attentive 
just soap- breakfast selection and quality was pretty poor 
we charged a little extra for street view 
this included personal escorts to hail a taxi and detailed advice to get the most out of each trip 
the lobby bar good 
great facilities and wonderful staff from airport collection to airport drop off 
great hotel with superb location 
and the major sights from the louvre to the arc de triumph 
if you come from the airport just take the bus to opera which drops you 50 meters from the hotel 
well in paris you got cheap hotels where you knock your head on the ceiling and fall of your 
the next day i had a light lunch in the cafe which was also very nice 
just opposite opera in city centre 
the many food outlets of the hotel were excellent 
we were told the the twin bedroom is a deluxe room i 
excellent family option in a great city location 
hip bars and new architecture 
the gym is big and you have everything you need for a good workout 
they served a good snac menu if you are on your own 
a nice new jug would have been just fine 
the gym was exceptional with every machine you could think of and the hotel also has a pool which i 
the concierge and front desk staff are courteous and professional 
the krungthep wing pool is shaded in the morning - go to the main pool 
we tried the chi spa and has wonderful treatments 
and even lying by the pool they bring you high tea ( sandwiches and cakes on silver trays ) 
delay at check in as one group tour is having problems with the room 
do provie free wifi internet at the lobby but not room 
novotel is just a short walk away in about 10 minutes 
meridien was also not willing to call for outside transport for us 
food service good 
nice furniture 
beautiful old glamour style hotel 
plus side is that you get free soft drinks 
it is very expensive to get to from airport but it is a long distance so to be expected 
the soundproofing was not great - we could hear people working in the next room at daytime 
if you want a real taxi then you have to hang around the entrance waiting for one bringing someone back 
it 's well worth the additional cost to benefit from the included extras and balconywhy stay anywhere else 
only criticism was that we were disappointed with the chef 's special sunday dinner 
staff are fantastic 
but this to me was a very inappropriate way to welcome a guest 
an elephant comes on the beach everyday and staff is very nice 
a nice bed and pretty pool ( although quite cold to swim in ) 
daily soft drinks and afternoon tea 
lovely beach 
whether they were front desk staff or gym or pool attendants or servers at the amazing array of restaurants and 
but man am i glad we stayed outside the main town 
a non smoking zone 
we prefer to be in the main building as it is much better 
location on the right side of the river and the pool 
the food is generally quite good and the gourmet pizzas are excellent 
they place have magnificent pools and they offer diving certification classes 
only takes about 7-8 mins though and plenty of transport is easily available 
our room was in the krungthep wing on the 9th floor with an amazing view 
this is an older style resort but whilst i was there it was going through a renovation and i had 
but it was not that clean on the floor and on the riverside 
the in room dining and mini bar is moderately pricedthe rooms are a little old fashioned but all in 
taxi ride into town is around 200 baht its about a 5 minute drive 
the wifi was pretty fast and it 's free in rooms for spg holders 
excellent swimming pool with really comfortable sunbeds and free bottles of water supplied during the day whilst 
- the beautiful private beach- the amazing pool area - there are like 5 of them 
it is a private beach - so nobody bothers you or tries to sell you anything 
nice quiet airconditioning 
the restaurant is situated on the river and the buffet breakfast was ok but let down by service that was 
great hotel but you must like them huge 
public spaces and rooms are that classic american high-end suburban look that one sees on hgt 
the pool bar is having good pizzas 
in hotels like this 
not professional as in working in a corporate environment ) women that loiter in the lobby and hotel bar 
there is a nice gym 
was informed that mondays tend to be a very busy at the airport 
this is definitely an area which can be improved upon 
room was excellent and the quality of food in the club lounge was very good 
the horizon lounge has a very nice view and plenty of food and drink options 
we also ate at the restaurant for dinner ( there is n't a lot of choice in the area 
the restaurants are amazing 
1 directly at the beach 
breakfasts a bit manic as everyone down at 7am and buffet layout restricted 
mrs haggis and our 2 kids aged 6 and 8 ) stayed here for 2 nights in 
little confusion driving into the hotel as the reception is on one side and our room was on the other 
there was a good sized bed with an international powerpoint and usb ports in the bedhead 
while the cozy lounge with roaring fireplace adds a warm touch ( pun intended ) respite from the cold 
the rooms are small ish 
hoi at the front desk 
and if you like walking perfect for a good walk up the mountain as the footpath starts across the 
they de feathered the room but did not clean the mattress or add a mattress pad after they 
tv has decent selection of programs and signal quality is good 
high floors not facing the highway is most likely the best 
short taxi ride to myeong dong or dondaemum 
probably for the carpeting or new wall paper 
but around the city are better and newer competitors 
the staff were friendly and helpful and we experienced few language problems 
barsthe lobby lounge is a relaxing place for a drink 
i am not sure that is has to do with the situation in bangkok but we can get 
arriving at reception you feel the warmth of the well educated staff 
20 min walk or one subway stop to tokyo university 
one nice touch 
the main train station is within walking distance which gives access to all parts of seoul ( and maybe 
the hilton millennium seoul is close to the downtown station and there is a shuttle from the hotel 
the overall service in the hotel and especially the concierge is very proffesional 
relatively spacious room but no wifi the room is relatively spacious for a tokyo hotel , the 
for internet you have to search a bit if you want to have it cabled 
my only complaint is the prices of room service - horrendously high 
overall sleep quality was good with the mattress and pillows 
we found the concierge lacking in helpfulness and friendliness 
large double bed 
the freworks display on the river on xmas eve was also an unexpected bonus 
within convenient walking distance into the cbd 
from the moment the red jacketed staff members greets you at the airport to the moment you 're 
there is no separate shower 
and it is a very short walk to the main shopping streets 
and each morning i thoroughly enjoyed breakfast in the spacious lobby area 
cool ride down the river by boat mozhnl . 
stayed here for 3 nights , on 12th floor . 
the ritz-carlton in istanbul is a wonderful and modern hotel with a nice 
some shopping mall nearby 
i have only positive reviews 
saying they 'd double booked our room due to a computer glitch - and would we accept a 
great facilities 
the service level is high 
i have never seen such good customer service 
the indoor hotel pool is one of the largest and most impressive i have sighted 
firstly no one informed us that its in a different building but the concierge jazz drove us 
the rooms are quite small but the bathrooms include a bath and shower which is always nice 
which was a prelude of the excellent service we received all the way through our visit 
very nice gym 
impressive a good stay and would recommend to everyone 
shopping and great dinning 
overall we enjoyed the stay . 
wifi throughout the property and free access to the gym 
so do n't stay here if you are expecting to be around the old city and yes you will 
the heavy traffic meant that a morning visit to the old city was not really an option for us and 
i did try the lobby restaurant one morning but my omelet and second cup of tea got lost 
location less than perfect 
the team is really very well prepared to support and welcome 
they also have the outdoor spa that is mainly used for relaxing and getting a tan while enjoying complimentary mil 
one of my favourite hotels in manila 
pretty good rooms 
it doesnot even have a great harbour view and yet it is a beautiful place 
staff were friendly and all services were provided very well 
but the beds are great and the bathrooms are good enough 
poor restaurants 
15 for 24 hours of wifi is a complete rip-off 
they did move me to a higher floor at check-in but it was late at night and the 
the river boat service to either river city or the bts station is fast and frequent 
we also have buffet dinner there and the food and service are of top standard 
just a normal guy who got a huge free upgrade which made for a memorable stay 
it is a much to dynamic and artistic city to find yourself stuck in a marriott looking out over 
the club lounge was good 
higher floors seem better 
the lobby was a sight to behold and the staff were very accomodating 
one step away from the greenbelt mall and with very good access to business locations 
but the shower tiles needed a good scrubbing- hard water stains on it and hair on the walls 
i gave this property 3 stars due to two major issues for me 
the room was very nice 
the pool was nice 
facilities were clean and services were terrific 
you 'll park next to the salk institute 
the upgrade to the executive lounge was worth it , a there is not much else to do there 
the front desk staff were all completely bored and dismissive of guests 
gym very so so only cardio machines as far as i could see anyway 
exceptional value 
with comfortable beds and great air conditioning 
it is tastefully decorated 
in an era when big lobbies are a rarity 
traffic noisy on lower floors 
the hot tub 
really good value for money 
the room and the bathroom is very clean but i have to say that the room is very small 
bakeries and the eiffel tower 
definitely the standard of breakfast service you would expect from a high end hotel 
with plush decor and one of those little wrought iron balconies 
there was n't much space between the bed and the desk 
you have to pay for internet service but many us-branded asian hotels you have to pay 15 
pool is a good size 
and in an excellent location ( next to the green belt where lots of shopping and restaurants are available ) 
they have a convention with a close parking 
the miso soup was stuffed . 
good omelettes 
i work with investors who own operates hotels 
tconrad staff actually remembers you 
so look for a good rate in one of the hotels with far better facilities 
for the price i expected better quality amenities in the bathroom and better outdoor furniture on the balcony 
long queues 
but check in is a touch labourious and our room did have the musty smoke smell 
with very limited outside space in which too relax 
this is quite an expensive place to stay in peak season 
the staff really go out of their way to make your stay more pleasant 
i loved the lobby area with the trendy setting of lovely leather sofas and arm chairs i think 
it was the perfect getaway and thank you hilton for always looking after me so well 
got an unexpected surprise with the location though 
its location makes accessing areas such as the castle and the royal mile very simple with short ( albeit h 
it dosnt help when other ihg hotels spoil you and upgrade you to the point it becomes 
this hotel was excellent in every way 
the foreign staff were much nicer than the native scottish people 
and what a nice beach 
beautiful modern building 
available nearby - and one of the two bars was closed for renovation 
room size is big 
we 've stayed here several times in the past and had mixed experiences 
excellent service 
the bathroom was good with double sink and decent size separate tiled shower 
super fast check in and early access to room which was a corner room with huge windows and tons of 
swimming both in the sea and pool very enjoyable 
good value for money and would stay here again 
the rooms were quiet and double glazed and the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly 
the bath was the largest and deepest i have seen for a long time 
i always stayed at the palace and then discovered the w and it 's more interesting vibe and modern 
lobby is really lively at night as the bar is located here 
much better options in san francisco 
for a cheaper massage 
we decided to finish our long weekend trip by staying one night at the ubud hanging gardens after 3 
though we liked lunch better than dinner 
same goes for the main pool 
no free parking for cars 
the beach is reasonable althoigh i suspect it may be on a concrete base using imported sand 
we told the attending front desk that we are willing to wait since their checked in time is still 3 
so many different choices for food and the quality was great 
this is a city where i always struggle to find a hotel i like 
am generally not a fan of ritz carlton 's due to their frilly american 
everything top notch-good sized rooms that feel up to date 
very disappointing was their incorrect mini bar charges after my checkout without asking or informing me and their reluctancy 
not a heavenly bed 
but still had a lively lobby with good drinks and entertainment 
it is only a 5 min walk from the tin hau subway station and right smack in the middle 
coffee shops also very close by 
this time i did not have a larger corner room yet the experience was much better 
bathroom is well appointed and water pressure in the shower was refreshing 
( nice park ) 
the bed was very comfortable and linens clean and crisp 
fast ( and free ) wifi 
the reception at the art gallery was especially a nice touch . 
the bathroom was really big 
the hotel is full throughout our stay but it is always quiet upstairs 
friendly employees ( and with humor ) 
surrounded by wide range of popular local restaurants and even a mcdonalds 
recommended place to stay as long as rates are reasonable 
the concierge staff is also very friendly and helpful 
i came into town to celebrate with one of my best friends from nursing school who just scored a 
from the beautiful mouldings on the wall to the bedhead and the ceiling rose over the bed 
phuket is known for happening partys and places . 
pool is nice for a cocktail or two or pick-a -number 
there is nothing quite like walking a few paces from bed to the pool to wake you up 
nice benefit of having complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the room as well 
great stay at the w in san fran 
oh and i forgot to mention the best part--their amazing cocktails served in the lobby bar 
will try the pool next time 
heavenly bed and a huge bathroom 
i found this to be a well managed property with an excellent service focus 
hip fun and funky 
but quite dark as there was only a small window 
nice cocktails 
near to mrt station 
this is a good quality hotel 
free internet and wifi is a great bonus 
fully non smoking hotel a big plus 
plenty of options and never crowded 
complimentary mini bars and the bed was comfortable 
the complementary minibar was complete with an illy espresso machine 
we enjoyed how the hotel provides different amenities such as free mini bar and nespresso 
once parked outside we waited with our luggage but no one turned up 
we booked several months in advance as we were attending a reception at the hotel so we got a very 
very poor customer service indeed 
alll the smaller issues will be fixed and you for sure have the best hotel in sin 
only the reception and the atrium breakfast area has been redone 
the building itself is not new but honestly well maintained with spacious and clean rooms . 
secure undercover parking is available and they have a wonderful pool area and gym with a full time personal trainer 
it was a pleasant stay with a huge buffet breakfast of the usual cold and hot food and a fabulous 
00 the empty bottles and glasses from the night before 
shops and restaurants and certainly a good option for business travellers 
this little hotel compared to other 5 star hotel in singapore has an excellent location and customer services 
i do n't think i have seen taps like the ones in the bathroom since my grandparents moved out 
this hotel also strategically located near shopping and eateries 
so i went to the front desk but they did n't have any so i had to sleep with 
bathroom had showers with hot water with a good force 
the hotel provides free parking and is well-located for taking the mrt 
but there were plenty of free street parking right in front of the hotel 
location is very good within walking distance of orchard mrt and orchard rdi stayed for five 
location is good check in is fast rooms are big hotel has a homely feel to it clean rooms 
i stayed for 7 nights and it was very good - i loved the service and the location was good 
this is my first time staying at this hotel 
good restuarant and bar downstairs - but worth heading outside and across the street to lau pa 
its located in the grand canal and is 5 minutes walk from the rail station 
mark 's tourist trap as it 's easily half the price or less and a much nicer atmosphere 
if you want a pool with more space better to stay elsewhere 
the water bus no 1 from across the canal to st marks square costs 7 euros one way and takes 
the room was spacious with a super king bed and very clean 
it is one of the first hotels in rome-lovely 
the lobby was was nicely decorate 
the rooms are a moderate size and the amenities are good 
great hotel my favourite hotel when i 'm in orchard road . 
i know the min-bar is free and i would understand if the hotel wants to charge for any 
i agree with other comments about the strange bathroom layout - fortunately i was on my own so leaving every 
the bathroom had a large window looking into the bed area ( a blind could be pulled down for privacy 
very warm this property is quite warm and very well located . 
while for the second part of the trip we got a room on one of the higher floors 
the swimming pool is very welcoming after a hot day sight seeing 
the roof top offers a phenomenal view of kampala city 
and were upgraded to a nice suite the first night 
hotel pool was small but we had a fun time 
a great hotel 
the best value for quality ever 
the pool area is small but not too busy as most people are out visiting the temples 
enjoyed breakfast outside 
it was great value for money and the location was also considered ideal 
the pool was small and not very inviting 
nice large pool ( there is another one but much smaller 
i particularly liked the tv in the bathroom and the extremely comfy bed 
they did take about 6 days to eventually get to grips with my gluten free request 
restaurants varied in quality with simply india being outstanding 
not particularly charming decor 
cafes and attractions in easy walking distance of the hotel 
the beds were very comfortable and various pillow options were available for those who have strong preferences 
nice to be collected at airport & transported to your resort efficiently & quickly 
got exactly what we expected - efficient reception 
we have heard that portland has a wealth of great restaurants 
and i found the noise outside one night too loud- your choice of room is important 
not enough lighting 
the package cost a little more but included free valet parking 
instead we received a very small top floor room with limited headroom 
a lot of renovation work was going on which caused me to take another route to my room which highlighted 
centrally located it is within easy access to most city sites 
from a previous visit we can recommend the kpc but that 's not for toddlers 
i 've stayed in this hotel on several occasions ( 5 weeks in total ) and the service has 
a very nice macaroni grill ( with prices about 25 higher than on the mainland ) has also 
quality hotel near the river a great hotel for the price in richmond . 
also choice at breakfast a little standard and dull 
very average concierge and service 
this inconsistency in quality of service is a problem for a hotel of this type 
the birds that fly around there are a bloody nuisance and i advise you to check your chairs before sitting 
my husband and i stayed here for three nights in mid march 
then a long corridor of which abuts the bathroom and then the bedroom at the end 
good quality tv 
the hotel 's location is good 
my bed was comfortable unlike that described by others who have reviewed this hotel 
it 's at the far north end of the resort and the last train stop 
we found staff and manager very helpfull 
the gym is well equipped and there is a pool too and spa 
the rest of the buffet have local dishes like spinach and lentils 
the club lounge was excellent with a good selection of wine and great views 
stayed over for a short conference for 3 days 
there 's convenient transportation to get around the large property ( a monorail and a boat ) 
decent room service 
i liked that it is next to a beautiful park which is great for a run 
but if you forget your camera it is a long walk back to get it 
overall the whole concept of a resort like this is cynical 
the park hyatt melbourne is in my opinion one of best cbd hotels in australia 
this is a small clean business hotel for local business travelers and low budget overseas travelers wanting clean but a 
the room is nothing special but the bed was comfy enough and the staff are friendly 
to make happy any customers and i did n't ask something going away of any rules 
select room in a higher floor facing the river 
most recently last week 
definitively an oasis of luxury with excellent service and great attention to all details 
it 's probably priced on the high side and not a great value 
the rooms are nice but small 
good food 
their warmth and hospitality was the most impressive of the hotel 's staff 
great view from my suite and everything you 'd need was in the room or a call away 
bar staff were very efficient and friendly 
if you can get a good price ( which we could n't at 400 per night ) 
there are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby 
the convention center is a short walk away too 
it was a quick 5 minute walk to the convention center 
good hotel at very good location 
the hotel is kept very well and my 8th floor room was relatively spacious for japanese standards 
it was on the 34th floor and gave beautiful views of bangkok 
perhaps it is time for an overdue renovation 
liked very much location is perfect in middle of comercial area walking distance to everything 
the only better hotel locations i can think of in kyoto ( having been there several times ) 
the staff are very friendly and helpful 
pros - extremely clean- well maintained- super comfortable and fluffy bed- good location with night markets 
the spa is a bit cramped with small changing rooms but the relaxation room is decent 
would give you blue color towel which is quiet big in size obviously for the swimming parti did fall 
beautiful , serene and restful i wanted to rest on a house on the water and that 
because the resort only had 2 buggies 
the boatride had an armed guard and the hotel security seemed good 
which are depressing and look terribly old ( surprising given that the resort was opened only in 2012 ) 
the front desk staff had been excellent 
the pool is nice and the hotel is in a good spot 
the staff were good 
the western food was also poor quality 
a good value for the money spent 
the room was large junior suite very clean & modern 
if you do n't need to be in the centre of town then thus is a great place to 
i had booked a suite and was upgraded to the nicest suites which was beautiful 
it is an area full of restaurants including many places with an international menu 
the gym is large and busy and you can see they have many other guests from outside the hotel who 
good location and easy access to the whole of wuhan with taxi 
the staff are outstanding and accommodating especially in the club lounge 
the gym is big 
room sizes are good with lovely bathroom 
blandest stir fried rice ever in the chinese restaurant 
this hotel is over ten years old and the carpets and furniture need cleaning or replacing 
closed to shopping mall and supermaket but mostly they open around 14 
very well-equipped gym and they even have yoga and dance classes for free 
i forgot to mention the superb gym 
smaller suites and full suites 
at the lobby bar there was an excellent ( and reasonably prices ) offer of great wines by the glass 
nice room 
-breakfast was good with two options to choose from 
the gym and the pool was excellent 
the cafe next to the pool serves food that is really quite good 
the hotel provides a card that gives free access to all busses - great value 
modern hotel 
i do n't mind getting the room i paid for if a property does n't upgrade diamonds but 
with lots of great amenities 
the metro station is right next door 
the hotel is a little farther from town than we would have liked 
but the spiral staircase is a visually inspiring option if you go to the top floor and look down 
fantastic hotel in fantastic city 
room service was great for breakfast and dinner and very quick - 20 mins only 
so good enough options to eat or to buy something 
breakfast buffet available in the 1st floor restaurant for 3300 isk ( reviewed separately ) 
beautiful public areas 
pool is basically a large bathtub 
would definitely stay again 
room and bathroom ok and good size but rather underwhelming and bed was too firm for my liking 
quiet street 
it 's at a very good point to explore the city and the areas around reykjav 
overall the service was impeccable with hotel staff going to great efforts to make the stay a great 
the credit card guarantee by our first guest has not been released by now 
big windows ( overlooking a parking lot 
the front desk was very helpful and gave us good restaurant tips 
spacious and internet is 17 megas 
which was enormous and beautifully decorated in an understated modern japanese style 
with attractive streets both inside and outside the ring in easy walking distance 
large lobby 
complimentary wine happy hour is a nice touch 
we went to our room on the 12th floor and the room was huge and very modern looking with 
the traffic news was really loud 
coffee and milk is included in the breakfast price 
we alerted the front desk to our concern and then went for a bike ride 
pool and snacks are great 
but the personalized high level of service that sets this hotel apart from the rest 
the area is very busy with the nearby comedy club and other eateries 
stayed 2 nights here in late decemeber 
the bathroom is quite big by japanese standards so i really liked it 
very hip with the check in set up and a nice feel to the lobby and the hotel 
victoria made a pleasant base for visits to the angkor and other temple sites i had wanted 
we enjoyed the christmas eve gala dinner but thought the event needed a master of ceremonies to welcome 
it really is a great location to base yourself 
located close to the subway therefore easy to get to other areas 
it looks more like a hyatt place with nice furniture 
i think the public area and guest floor corridor have been renovated in recent years which gave me a good 
there are numerous restaurants 
and the upper level is the busy lobby and front desk 
all the accoutrements one might expect of a 5 star hotel are in abundance at the hotel 
some kind of design and also service in the old style 
it is far different from the new age hotels of today 
the pool is very nice 
that is the best thing of the hotel 
meals are available with indoor or outdoor seating 
and adequate storage 
there is a large park in front of the hotel 
i thought the choices at lunch to be excellent ( ie tried the gigantic and perfectly cooked river prawn 
the space for toilet and bath was very well-used ( which has a walk-in closet ) 
some are closer to the main area 
when we visited the top floor bar there was a very loud disco dj there during the happy hour 
we selected this hotel ad it seemed good value for such an excellent location on the magnificent mile 
but it was close to the restaurant and reception area 
we were not offered welcome drinks and had to ask for those 
probably my only two ( small ) complaints are 1 ) shower head is a bit painful and 2 ) 
but the lobby was extremely busy when we came down to the lobby at 8am 
yummy breakfast and even the skybar 
high floor 
great location with amazing view of sigiriya rock from across the pool 
the rooms were bad 
if it is luxury that you want 
the newly renovated rooms on the 19th floor are very nice compared to the rooms on the lower floors 
the room was ok ( i was on a low floor ) and the mattress was somewhat worn 
while the lobby is very grand 
the hotel is near the centre of chennai which is fairly polluted 
the bed was extremely comfortable and it was great to have the sitting area in which to a relax after 
the bedroom had a drought coming from a window and it was -750 degrees 
breakfast was very nice and checkout well handled 
what a friendly and cooperative staff 
well clean daily and nice facility amenities in room 
hope that floorlamps are available 
my room rate was very reasonable ( i stayed at a different hotel in chicago a couple weeks ago 
amazing stay in a nice room overlooking snow clad mountains 
especially the external unit on the small balcony next to the bed 
not the best hotel but the room views of the mountain make up for some of the above 
we were informed that the only other evening food venue was at a backpackers place and there was a 
very good gym and pool as well 
the rear wing upper floors have the best views 
wifi was provided free of charge 
the front desk staff was quite nice and got a light fixture problem fixed for us quickly 
spacious with comfortable beds & pillows 
linens all good 
big rooms on top floor with great views 
fresh and not too much with a great open bar area 
we have n't really enjoyed the place yet i am comfortable staying in this hotel 
having an amazing bathroom and shower with a heated floor was a nice touch 
and the food is good 
i understand that mini-vans only hold 13 passengers and that there are logistical challenges to giving every 
we stayed in both types and irrespective of where you are in the hotel the speed is atrocious 
the restaurant prices are expensive and it will cost about 6 to take a taxi to an outside restaurant 
super modern with some unique extras like netflix on the tv 
very nice plush rooms 
we did the buffett dinner at boneka one night and was equally impressed with their dinner as well 
i was told i would be charged an additional 20 euros to use the jacuzzi 
the fine dining food was very good 
the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean 
( 360f for a deluxe room with breakfast ) the parking garage is also an issue 
staff is friendly and professional and the location is convenient if you need to go to airport 
there is also a cafe with an outside sitting area where light snacks and afternoon tea is served 
best croissant since i last visited paris 
very good location 
our suite was cleaned to perfection 2x a day 
the bathrooms even smaller and the decor is old 
beach and restaurants you are required to buy bottles of either for roughly us 6 
given i have not even arrived at the hotel yet , and knowing this is the level of customer 
all the staff being wonderful 
and be in beautiful surroundings ( and do n't mind flying a long ways if you 're from 
this is the best property in berlin 
mainly due to the fact of major construction is taking place which meansthat traffic flow is limited 
we were offered an inexpensive upgrade and took it so our room was quite large and comfortable 
their wedding villa was amazing and the whole set up was so romantic 
beautiful property with a lovely lagoon pool decorated with plants 
the rooms are quite a good size ( even the standard rooms like we had ) and there was almost 
of course the staff was extremely helpful and made our stay very pleasant 
free breakfast and free drinks and heavy snacks at dinner 
the property is modern and the rooms have what 's needed for a pleasant stay 
the lobby and even the elevators are full of art 
the staff was helpful 
comfortable and very quiet despite facing the street outside 
probably from the lack of good ventilation in the bathroom and a good bleaching of the pipes from time 
the gym is very nice 
the bar is good and there are a number of restaurants available inside the hotel to choose from 
the sheraton in moscow is a good hotel 
it was difficult to set the right temperature in the room and i decided to sleep with the window open 
great place to go on to the airport and leave your car of see croke park 
love the public areas 
rather use some of the great restaurants that singapore has to offer 
complete breakfast - next to the main road 
direct entrance to mall and close to amazing restaurants and bars 
handy for early flight 
the lounge merges seamlessly into the lobby and bar where red drapes and artwork flow to create 
could book direct & get discount & free breakfast ( although who would want it 
fast internet and ac worked well 
prices are high 
the lobby is a large lounge area 
the resort is high enough that even when fog is clinging to the coastline you can enjoy the sun above 
the ambience of the restaurant is nice 
the staff are very friendly the rooms comfortable and convenient eating and shopping all around 
everything about the resort is perfect 
hotel is considerably old and rooms are quite dated but the sheets are clean and bed is comfortable

first time for me was a customer mobile device included in room equipment as service guide 
we had a wonderful stay

food options are also more than adequate despite having only one restaurant 
perfect stay after 12 months stayed again after 12 months with the family . 
rooms with water view are excellent as full glass from ceiling to floor 
wooden flooring at the entrance of the room was quite a sight to cross over 2 3 times

i did find when having tea using hot water from the machine 
come on guys in belgium & your waffles are like crumbling cardboard 
central location near the train station 
is very close to the train station and it was easy to comute 
but they were of a good size and quality and unlike many comparible hotels 
the children loved the elevators whisking you up to the top floors 
i was offered extra points or welcome drink 
bathroom is a full marble bathroom and well equipped with hansgrohe rainshower 
gym is extremely small for such a large hotel and it is not unusual to dress for gym 
every room is different 
excellent old architecture with beautiful modern decor and a wonderful view 
buffet breakfast was good but have had better 
you are right opposite a large shopping mall with a really good food court and on all the main transport 
these hotels and the others in the same area are very close to the place that the city tours begin 
villas are typical of rooms of that price 
the breakfast offers various choice of delicious set menu 
the rooms are all pretty standard but the bar area and roof top restaurant and bar are really good 
other than that a typical asian luxury hotel with good service but somewhat lax room cleaning ( no cleaning 
but somehow on a lower budget 
extra bed only rm50 
i do agree that our valley pool villa was nicely decorated and well equipped 
bed & pillows comfortable 
i loved their payjamas so much i bought one to take home 
and in my last review i wrote that the hotel is declining 
the internet connection was slow and it kept breaking but it was not the hotel 's fault because i 
the balcony was a nice touch 
instead we just sat by the new main pool which was gorgeous and the views were lovely 
our room is huge and comfortable 
this is located nowhere near oktoberfest of the main sights in munich 
i would recommend that you try and source a direct trip to the wall 
the s-bahn train station is accessed through the basement so it 's super convenient to get 
check in friendly but they asked me if i want to become a hhonors member 
due to problem with the standard room we originally booked we were upgraded to a small suite which was fantastic 
the rooms are beautiful 
impersonal and they did not even try to put themselves into my position to make my experience better but 
very nice property with a super location 5-10 minutes walk from city center and 2 minutes from the 
great boutique hotel in a good location 
i really want to commend them on the staff and the great attitude they have 
the concierge , lisa , did an amazing job organizing a privately led docent tour

breakfast is quite ample with plenty of choices for most guests . 
and easy access uber spots to get to places further away 
good bathroom and free wifi 
especially the outdoor terrace with the frauenkirche in the distance 
just average sorry to say 
arriving at the hotel lobby after 2pm

the only available size of bathrobes is medium

my husband and i had a fabulous stay at the bellagio 4 years ago and saved to bring 
close to the main station 
10 minutes to munich central station and 35 minutes to munich airport - perfect 
the hotel is modern 
there are also two computers in the lounge and one printer 
the wifi was free in room as it was weekend - normally there is a charge 
i found the hotel to be quiet at night so a good nights sleep is achievable 
the one thing i do n't like is that they charge you for everything 
the twin beds supportive and inviting 
best place to be when in goa fascinating food perfect ambience musical nights are perfect best goan

this is really annoying if you are trying to get anything work related done 
the food is good quality and the kitchen was happy to adapted a meal to my liking 
the shopping mall next mall is a good relief after a day of work and is a good place for 
this has been one of my favourite hotels for years and whilst it is still good 
making a visit with a car hire essential 
the rooms facing the street are noisy 
a decent and greatly appreciated gesture of loyalty recognition 
breakfast buffet very good and seafood dinner buffet good choice 
the oysters were warm and milky . 
but it has a great balcony so you can eat outside with a view 
breakfast offers a wide choice of items in the lively and open concept area of the main restaurant 
by car you do not need to experience the crawling traffic of the walkthe walk is at 5 min 
we spent 2 happy nights here in late october and were very happy 
so nice to feel the sea breeze and they had wonderful cocktails as well 
there are several hammocks by the beach which you will love 
asked the front desk where a print center was 
for the price for a room it was n't great value 
onsite gym as pretty good for a hotel and the other activities such as shooting and archery were 
our stay and trip were made special by people behind uma by como and the wonderful staff who 
rooms are plenty of size ( mine had a living room and bedroom which i think is standard ) which 
the beachthe beach was nice and spacious 
was far away from the main building and jeewan drove us back and forth with buggy most of 
close to toronto main attractions 
the view to the mountains was very nice and windows could be opened 
it is a fantastic location in downtown toronto and easy to work to eating places 
the internet was average but wifi was available everywhere 
right in the middle of all the restaurants and beautiful scenery 
ask for valley view high floor with a balcony 
some nice chairs around the pool and excellent views of the city 
very good restaurant 
over priced for what you get 
location in in town is perfect 
restaurant and bar were great and the quality of food brilliant 
its also closer to the angkor temple area if you like us chose to rent a bike rather 
the pool was pretty much also constantly in the shade due to it 's positioning 
the staff is professional from the moment they pick you up from the airport 
opt for the premier villa which is a lot better than the premiere rooms 
but nonetheless the property is nice for a one night stay 
food was not good but ambience was nice 
the restaurant breakfast is rather extensive but tend to be same menu everyday 
gym and the swimming pool 
in room dining was great looking at the distance and rains even at night 
they are on higher floors and quite 
impressive hotel lobby 
close to many attractions like india gate 
this place is really 2 hotels 
the beach is beautiful although it was often quite difficult to find sun beds 
once we arrived there i was surprised from the level of service they are providing . 
this is a great stay 
the sound-proofing was very good & there was no noise from the very busy streets below 
closet hanging space and a warm feeling due the the lime washed laminate flooring and aust 
but in need of redecorating and a new carpet 
will surely stay with them again 
right in the hearth of chinatown and a little walk from restaurants and pubs 
and the mall is so adjacent that you can drop by anytime you want 
the hote itself is confusing as the lobby is tied to the grand mercure 
my room was tired 
the musty smell 
stayed here for 1 night last week hotel is well located and good value in melbourne 
the basin in the bathroom had very little room to store a toothbrush let alone anything else 
this is quite a well located and secure hotel 
avoid this place if your company can afford better options 
the spa was amazing and we did the scrubs 
the four points by sheraton vancouver airport is situated in richmond close to vancouver international airport 
nice gardens terrible hotel 
just it is little bit noise that you are easily notify people in and out 
no bath plug due to government regs 
a friend who was staying longer checked out to stay there--at adu120 
the checkin was smooth while there was no personal welcome 
the petra moon represents excellent value for money 
we ever tried to ask the front desk for delivery to wadi rum 
rooms were great and service was usual four seasons standards 
perfect price-point 
hangzhou is a historic city of renown beauty that is a major holiday destination for prc tourists 
i am not giving it an excellent rating but a good rating for a 4 star hotel 
stay here if you have no other choice but are better hotels in town 
apartments if you want space are good value 
read the reviews here and you will know they need some work 
) to a 2 bedroom deluxe apartment - which was huge 
pool bar serves great drinks 
the hotel has wifi throughout - free in the lobby 
the front desk claimed that this was not at all possible 
carpets are n't dirty but quite tired as well 
the amazing dry martini at the bar and the very good live jazz singer 
hotels has many corporate customers and occupancy rate is always high 
decent amenities 
but overall nice hotel 
he said there is no late checkout because i was in a suite 
this hotel was in such a good locatation ( close to shops and the petronas towers 
try for higher floors - ensures a good view 
highly recommend the buffet breakfast and the yum cha restaurant was good as well 
one of my top 3 hotels in china -- and i 've stayed in more than 50 
you would need a taxi to transport you to and from there 
kind of thing you should n't have to worry about in an expensive hotel 
there is no heated pool to enjoy in winters as well so the quality of activities within hotel is very 
i stayed in the 1 bedroom apartment which is great for a small family like mine 
was only at the hotel one night but the food and service were good and the room was clean and 
dowdy colors and old dinged furniture 
two great team players 
a cinema and a wonderfull spa 
they claim one of the largest swimming pools in india 
the swimming is nice and was surprised to be pampered with ice cream on a hot day 
super brekkie buffet ( hot and cold ) 
buffet breakfast spread was good 
a popular shopping mall where you can easily grab a meal 
the bathroom was also very large and had a separate shower and bath 
good view balconies 
as a mr platinum received complimentary upgrade and free breakfast coupons 
staff are uber friendly and catered for all our requests regardless of how strange 
i know there are different sizes and locations of rooms 
the gym is well equipped and the bar has a good selection of drinks 
very convenient to downtown businesses 
the bath is also roomy 
breakfast is on the top floor 
but the 1st floor have outdoor showers 
near the castle and the sea 
they are small but perfectly fine with very comfortable double bed 
the restaurant where we had breakfast had excellent wait staff - polite and efficient 
walking distance from various restaurants as well 
my room 253 is small overlooking a dirty roof top and aircon outlets 
the hotel staff is also very nice 
the property is new 
bring the coffee and then the bill when i wanted to pay 
the bugis junction shopping mall is also across the street offering more food options in addition to some serious 
rooms are nice- not the best ever--but very nice and the service was what one would expect 
because i had read reviews of the hotel before my stay i knew that getting to the hotel might be 
tea and non alcoholic drinks were provided each day in the room 
overall a good resort and recommended 
i had a very nice stay 
i guess it 's advertised as a family resort so fair enough 
they have a private beach as well 
seemed odd since check-in is at 4pm 
grounds were very nice - nice beach - about 1-mile to duval 
this is probably a great time to visit as the hotels and the fantastic historical sites are not at all 
a view of the beach is the main reason for staying 
clean and tidy room 
next time we visit 
there was private access to the dead sea which was somewhat under construction during our time there 
very nice pool areas there was some contruction on part of the beach area owever they still had 
good choice of food and good quality 
the property is about a 15 minute walk from duval so just left the car in valet the 
i booked an aromatherapy for 90 mins and did not expect that for a so called 5 star 
too bad that even the blanket also filled with damp smell so ended up even my pyjamas smell 
it feels like a basement club which at midnight may be the right atmosphere but not really for early evening 
and good restaurants bar 
not a good value for the 
only 1 trip was available and that was at 12 noon 
aircon is super cold and shower is strong and hot 
good choice for airport hotel - conveniently located 
it 's way too close to the toilet and the bathtub 
the young men at the entrance are very helpful with getting a taxi and making sure you get to the 
rooms were spacious & wifi snappy along with ample power points in room 
with the only elevators at one end of the c 
the room was adequate and clean but the decor is very tired still the bed was comfortable 
prompt and free shuttle for early am flight 
the good is that it is close to airport 
good to get out of the centre and nearby has some restaurants like the vine 2 minutes walk from hotel 
but we found several nice restaurants within walking distance from the hotel 
they knew it was my birthday & arrived at our room with a complimentary platter of fruit 
the very good rating is certainly a bit exaggerated 
some staff were polite and some were not ( inconsistent ) 
albeit it pricey for the quality i m accustomed to , it was convenient . 
close to lots of western restaurants 
-food was overall average at the main restaurant 
what a fantastic hotel for a really great price 
that proved the check in was super smooth and taxis were in line waiting on standby 
that beach umbrellas were only available for purchase 
but i 'll probably try elsewhere next time i visit 
worth the visit 
we enjoyed hot afternoons with a swim 
there was a bathtub and a separate shower area 
no extra charge 
it is good value for the price we paid and serves us well 
location wise all in the same area of the corniche as the other name brand hotels so no 
lovely views of the beach and the sound of crashing waves from our room makes this an address to 
however the double bed was uncomfortable and was brokenhotel exterior 
this is a beautiful hotel on the sea front with a wonderful pool area and really old fashioned surr 
takes longer for guests to check-out 
there are also several restaurants along the water 
we have stayed at this hotel many times now and the service etc never changes 
the beds are so soft 
rooms are spacious and nicely appointed 
the location of the hotel also is a street away from the classic charles street with majority of the 
top very good hotelperfect location walking distance to shopping and restaurantswe got access to lounge with perfect happy 
the bed was super comfortable 
this is cooler than gramercy in ny and so much better service 
5 bathrooms and excellent molton brown amenities ( sold separately at the concierge desk ) 
unfortunately we did n't try any of the f&b outlets due to our very short stay 
the views of this beach we exceptionally beautiful around the property 
the pool area nicely spread out and the gym 
w doha is a great city hotel 
just a few steps away from the main square 
off one of the light in the bathroom with their air regulation fan connected 
the main lobby leads into an interesting glass roofed atrium 
with only one desk chair 
you really ca n't go wrong with this hotel and all the positive reviews are accurate 
not good staff management 
but don 't let that one negative item sway you--this hotel was very nice for the price 
the location was great and the view from the harbour suite was great 
i noticed that our old room was occupied the night after we left 
our only hesitation in recommending it wholeheartedly is that if you hit a tour group peak in the hotel 
the restaurant was closed for dinner but with so many restaurants nearby this was n't a problem 
the hotel is a solid business hotel 
on a week long trip to st andrews , our family annual easter retreat , my 
ask for an upper floor and a harbour view room 
somewhat pricey but great 
we stayed at the hyatt regency down the street and it is a bit of a dump compared 
in particular the pool area is unattractive with cracked concrete and defacing giant disability seat helpers scattered about 
lots of good restaurants nearby 
but this was at the back of the building over the loading dock and the garbage bay and all we 
but we would investigate other options first 
we loved the fact that the balcony opened onto circular quay and we could watch the ferries come 
plenty of towels and a fully functioning kitchenette with coffee mugs 
enough space for exercises 
i did n't trust them by then and asked for a pager to page me when room is 
with the infinity edge was great and access to the other pool and beach was simple and easy 
we arrived from our long haul flight from sydney early in the morning 
i do n't think the quality of the room and the service reached it 
i was attending a large conference on the second floor and everyone was trying to get between the first and 
its various restaurants 
the sheets are of very poor quality and the bathrobes had massive holes in them 
the hotel and rooms were well equipped 
followed by a rude manager calling me demanding a voucher - completely unnecessary seeing that it had been their 
they seem to fill a lot of spaces with things like air hockey and pool tables - so you end 
the hotel staff is friendly and helpful 
the breakfast buffet is excellent and not to be missed 
the gym is excellent 
the pool was our biggest disappointment 
instead of giving me a room on the first floor with zero view 
this hotel is located fairly close to the historical centre of bratislava and has plenty of decent 
we arrived at 4pm and got a very good lunch portion deal- and no need to wait 
that were not available in the small lounge 
with little to no furniture or decor to speak of 
good hotel but nothing exceptional 
i 'll definitely be back on my next vegas trip 
staff in dry bar were good craic too 
the pool area is great with water slides in the general pool area and an adults only infinity pool 
what stuck me in the lobby and the casino of this hotel was how casual everybody was 
excellent location near significant monuments and the gran via and the buffet breakfast was one of the best 
it is worth the extra cost--if for no other reason 
which is a public beach 
concierge and friendly happy people everywhere 
the check-in lines seemed to be slow however the time we were at the check-in desk 
with the best bars 
we had dinner one day at joelia 
room service us fantastic 
this hotel was conveniently located in the airport between the domestic and international terminals the hotel itself is a 45 
hotel casino is a bit dark 
this is also the one and only airport hotel in bali airport 
one at the beginning of our trip and the second night at the end of our trip 
extremely good location 
the location is great only a minute walk international departures and about a 5 min walk from arrivals 
there were still people partying outside at the jacuzzi being loud and obnoxious 
the breakfast was excellent 
where there are plenty of options 
bathroom was very nice - marbled 
like any other typical sheraton hotel 
the hotel looks secluded at its entrance but it is actually not a far walk from taksim 
rooms have a great view of the bosphorus ( though there are many other hotels which are actually 
which is cheaper than parking 
the front desk staff were very helpful and our room spacious and clean even if the mattress was getting a 
we had a separate bedroom with full couch bed 
the hotel has a great location right in the middle of the strip and walk distance from the city 
our original flight was a direct flight and the one we took the next day had a layover and 
they are not that great . 
i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a long weekend getaway 
taxis seemed plentiful and not too expensive but the traffic often looked grid locked in the city so not 
tip after u reserve call every 30 days and ask for lower price we got ors down to 79 
they have a nice gym and great swimming pool 
in the evening the lounge was full 
the windows can be opened and that also lets in the street noise 
the weather was perfect during our entire stay 
ten minutes down the street is one of munich 's biggest food markets where cheese and sausage shops 
great value for vegas 
have never seen such small bathtub before 
the room was well appointed with a view of the strip which was nice for all the lights 
great view of las vegas from a glass box high up on the 31st floor 
i have returned to the big old hilton of istanbul - enjoyed by heads of state over 
checking in was a pleasure and the lady who was helping me was very friendly and even upgraded us as 
clean and spacious 
hotel is located close to old town and right behind paseo colorado 
great restaurants and friendly staff 
long walk to room but very nice interior 
furniture in my room had chips in it and the walls were marked up in places -w 
interiors are a little dated but the most important thing is that this property was convenient to the airport 
perfect decoration as fresh concept 
staff was very nice and the facilities were all nice 
nice hotel for a night 
the lobby is quite busy ( lots of airline personnel stay here ) and there is a fantastic bar 
the room was very quiet and the glazing is excellent since when i opened window next morning you could 
& a separate check-in 
it is close to the airport and overlooking the national park ( hence given the possibility for short time visitors 
had a huge oval bathtub and the amenities were nice 
beautiful bathroom 
room very modern and spacious with automatic curtains 
few roomscons- paid wifi- no breakfast - but in italy 
then the 25 euro internet special gets you a magnificent silver tray of delicacies you cannot possibly eat and 
but it would n't be wise to let pre-teens roam around alone since there 's 
this should be a 100 per night resort at best 
but functional with a large safe 
very trendy and minimalistic interior 
room facing the strip has nice view 
you are a short walk to mirage 
located on an extremely busy section of road about 15 minutes from the international airport its a great place 
its okay for an airport hotel but i am sure there are better options in town for similar pricing 
it has a bit more of a calm feeling than some other large hotels 
also towels are quite thin 
but not outstanding & the reception staff are efficient but lacking warmth 
in my opinion the worst choice among the better hotels in geneva 
the new room had the same comfortable king size bed and all the mod cons of the original room 
i was on 14th floor - no great views but a floor below the club lounge where good break 
it is very expensive and the quality is not superb 
the pool looks nice but the gym is small and poorly equipped 
but it 's clean and with good facilities 
considering the nice location of the hotelpros- great service - at the counter and lounge 
this time the room was rather ok 
with 2 full bathrooms and alot of wood ( doors 
the fitness area is a miniscule glass cubicle in the hotel lobby 
where you also have a separate check-in area 
the location is perfect if you have business in the brooklyn area 
three times as expensive as comparable hotels in madrid and hamburg 
the food was uniformly very good 
the hotel staffs was very courteous friendly . 
for non chinese visitors are very limited ( esp 
the public areas were all elegantservice was professionally cheerful 
nice decor 
the hotel is within easy walking distance of many restaurants and shopping options including grocery stores 
colonial settings with the courtyard 
the hotel has a nice pool and fitness center 
the swimming pool is large and it is indoor facing the lake 
i have travelled across the world and the service and quality you get or experience here is as good as 
rooms are well furnished with great views . 
much tastier options outside the hotel this would be a good business option for one person for a short 
we were then shown to a very dated room that had a musty smell 
very clean and all the toiletries you could need are included 
the mean streak extends to toiletaries in the bathroom - half empty shampoos and soaps not 
looking outside of the window 
entering the ground level concierge lobby one immediately knows this is a luxurious and elegant hotel with 
room size is small and compact 
nihonbashi two blocks away and ginza district is a 10 min walk 
i highly recommend this hotel to stay for your visit to the beautiful west lake of hangzhou 
but management kept the fitness room open for those wanting a hot shower with clear water 
we tried to change to a bigger room but not possible 
lobby smells great 
the bathroom is spacious as well 
yet intimate and like all high floors has a nice view of tokyo city 
the restaurants were excellent 
room was a good size 
lots of shopping nearby 
i only stayed for one night but was impressed by the quality of the hotel and the room 
and the hotel we stayed in had no more free rooms 
the sports bar has the largest tvs i think i 've ever seen in a bar - but 
we were given a lovely room on the top floor which had a small balcony 
the facilities were beyond clean 
it was in easy walking distance from hot spots in the marais and oberkampf 
the beds and pillows were comfy and the room was quiet 
only thing i feel they could do better is the bed 
other contributors has made mention of the 8th floor lounge and the complementary supper 
but as i 'm a long-time frequent visitor to singapore and know the city very well 
just below is a beautiful park and tea garden 
service is great as always with lovely gym 
when it was time to catch our flight home our taxi driver had a neat shortcut to the train station 
the desk staff were friendly and professional 
one of the downsides of the hotel location was the loud noises emanating from both drunk and non drunk 
the small hotel 's advantages over all huge hotels with plus 400 guests 
000yen ( a bit pricey but worth it ) 
bell staff were heaps more helpful and the front desk staff warmer 
stay in this hotel if you want every problem solved easily and quickly 
the room had a balcony with a great view of the lake 
special call-out to ida at reception who was brilliant and helped us resolve a problem with a 
excellent restaurants and food service 
the walk was easy and so picturesque 
balcony could do a little more privacy to neighbours 
decent quick stay 
apartments ( we stayed in a two bedroom ) are nice 
just a 10 minute walk to the bus station next door 
the breakfast was a huge spread and you still could order eggs cooked to your liking 
amazed by excellent service 
ordered room service on the first night which did n't turn up but after a follow up phone call 
very expensive but also very good high-end hotel located rather interesting between very traditional gardens and very modern 
dinner in the restaurant was excellent 
as it is next to central station 
stayed for one night during a short trip through oslo 
extraordinary services the hotel staffs offer the best ever service i have experienced . 
reception very polite and friendly 
the breakfast venue was very busy and crowded during saturday and sunday 
it seems the manager supervisor did n't like us 
no introduction to the hotel and staff not interested in guests means you will have to explore around the hotel 
executive lounge facilities adequate and service good 
the location makes it easy to access the pedestrian area ( florida street ) 
the staff are quite friendly and efficient 
4 ) great breakfast selection ( you can ask for special orders like omelette 
i was staying in one of the world 's truly great hotels 
there was a separate big bath 
a big jumble of baggage in the reception as guests and convention attendees store their baggage 
the room was impeccably clean and well appointed 
despite the issues i would be happy to stay again 
good size and modern decor 
a good quality base 
wonderful shower 
do n't go pass the train station like building or towards the harbour areas 
the pool and the spa area is definitely not to be missed 
nice staff but facility not deserving of the westin name 
bathroom plumbing was sufficient with reasonable shower capacity 
complimentary mini bar 
room was small and cramped 
other issue was kids were always in the hot tub that was reserved for 18 or older 
and good food to boot 
we enjoyed a king suite mid march for 2 nights 
this great boutique hotel is certainly in the right place if you want to be able to walk everywhere 
this hotel is well located opposite kyoto station 
two of the three bathrooms had tvs as did both bedrooms and the living room 
very nice breakfast spread which it 's possible to take outside overlooking the pool 
you can walk from your airport express bus to the hotel in 10 min 
with decent sized rooms 
the pool is great and the buffet breakfast is amazing with everything from a soup bar to a egg station 
walk towards your right and the hotel will appear 
the bedroom window was double glazed but the bathroom one was n't so noise from people leaving the 
good travel services 
the hotel is well located very close to the main station 
we booked executive lounge access and the staff there were great fun with a good selection of food and cocktails 
steam room and hot and cold spa baths - perfect to relax the legs after a day of exploring ang 
the bed is rock hard which some will like and others will hate 
water pressure is good 
the pool is large enough and includes a whirlpool 
enjoyed breakfast & dinner at the restaurant - both good 
mini bar ( 2 
the tram pass the road in front of the hotel and the nearest metro station is next to colos 
which felt like a part of the same building - busy 
if you have money you will be treated well and the trident gurgaon is no exception 
decent coffee 
made for a couple uncomfortable nights when it was warm outside 
clean and modern - value for money 
drawback is the distance you need to walk to the reception due to he low height density being only 
i ate at the buffet place which had a good selection and was n't too expensive 
they have a courtesy car to take you to ambience mall which is close but do to the busy 
located about 30 minutes from the international airport ( not a bad drive now that the new toll road 
food and service in main trident restaurant was very good 
the rooms are very comfy and i enjoyed on both nights a very comfortable nights sleep 
i got a decent hotel in a good location away from the smoke and noise of big casinos 
it comes with full amenities and disposable slippers which a lot of 3 star hotels i went to does 
the marble bathroom had a great walk in shower and lots of fresh towels 
another superb stay 
checkin helpful and courteous and gym ok ( recently upgraded since i was here last ) 
accommodation modern and spacious 
the restaurant serves good food 
spa and swimming pool - are great and well maintained 
we ended up in a suite with lots of snacks and welcome champagne with a nice view of the multiple 
four seasons top quality 
this peaceful tranquil setting nestled in hunter valley must be heaven for golfers 
i 'm very satisfied with the guest relation service 
it was very spacious and had a huge balcony overlooking the highly impressive golf course 
a nice spa and gym facilities 
i was lucky enough to get upgraded to the suite which is extremely spacious with decent view of the par 
clean and a good size 
separate shower bath and a well-sized sink 
huge bathroom also with bath 
very friendly receptionist who offered the best rate available similar to the best rate in the internet 
large living area with a free snack plate 
if you want to be at the centre of the old town 
the weekend we were there seemed very low occupancy 
it is actually little bit tricky to find since it is situated on the small street by the sukh 
room was located in 13th floor which was extremely large 
we took our one year old and the room was prepared with everything a kid can possibly need 
so it 's a short walk away 
i was offered 2pm late checkout too 
1 with direct access to the swimming pool 
if we can get the same nice price 
on the opposite side of the lobby is a hooters restaurant and bar 
my room was good 
trendy city hotel thing has been moving into the bigger asian cities of late 
great breakfast 
great lobby and the restaurant is a window onto helsinki life 
the rooms are filled with little thoughtful touches 
the wifi was free in the lobby but expensive in the rooms 
once in the pool wing and once in the garden wing and both rooms had a bathroom sink that would 
the bed and the bathroom was fine 
breakfast is notable with lots of choices and a big gorgeous dining room on the main floor 
very high and empty lobby 
tea and coffee etc you will need to go elsewhere 
just an extremely dull and dated hotel in the middle of nowhere 
the soaps in the bathroom were high class and smelled lovely 
large free car park 
stress free we were recommended to come here by a friend , we decided to get here to the airport 
the building toward the left runways is almost complete so no construction noise remaining . 
we wanted to try this hotel after reading the great reviews 
which really shows you how much this property values loyal guests 
but the airport is a good distance from downtown munich and for the airport 
if you are new to munich and want to stay in the city you are better off with hotel 
the shower tap is weird and very difficult to switch to the water temperature that you need 
there is a good compact gym and nice outdoor pool area 
the city of mainz is a perfectly lovely little town best known for its most famous prior reis 
the only minus during my stay was that staffing at breakfast could not really coop with the number of 
there is little thai design or esoteric artistry nor lavish flower arrangements in the public spaces 
was quite good - decent wifi 
very extensive buffet 
but seriously the hotel is beautiful 
the location is really great for shopping in mainz and the hotel had umbrellas available for the 
we would gladly choose to stay in four points again when we return to bangkok to visit our newly 
very professional and friendly front desk 
easy access directly from airport 
still keeping up to its good name and quality 
full bus 
but it was clean and smelled nice 
i think we paid 50 for a small salad 
the toilet is also bigger 
to business meetings and to dinner - reliable 
my room looked out over the tennis courts and the mountains 
gym is good too but swimming pool was closed - then at this time it would be pretty chilly 
but still an excellent property 
rooms are nice and big 
an excellent airport hotel 
we could see the swimming pool which was on day one of being drained for annual maintenance 
while the lobby is modern the rooms are extremely old 
good speed of the water in the shower and bathtub - a short one - seem to be standard 
braekfast is excellent at coffee shop and the restaurants are under renvoation 
there are many activities and the watersports are fun 
the rooms are large 
close to the airport and great rooms 
public areas and facilities were very good 
it is a very good business hotel 
plus it is only a very short drive to the airport which is great for early morning flights 
the rooms are large & comfortable but beginning to show a bit of an age 
which is worth its weight in gold after a long flight 
rooms were clean and comfortable and a decent size 
the rooms are small and the hotel is very dated 
overall a great hotel and we would definitely stay here again 
bathroom not cleaned properly 
this may be worth a trip for a family to get some bargins 
ample towels 
all of the hotel staff concierge were extremely helpful and friendly 
the beds were comfortable and the bathroom spotless 
the hotel in public areas and bedrooms is beautifully appointed 
could not turn on heating as a small lounge chair was up against it and not able to move 
standard international hotel 
the room is very small and has no air con or free wi fi 
and again a good experience with really efficient and pleasant staff and the food exactly as described on the menu 
was there only for a night but it was a great hotel -- good ambience and excellent staff 
was in the hotel for 2 nights for a business trip 
the service was first class and the hotel has a superb spa and has fabulous restaurants and bars 
the wine list is fantastic and it was very gracious of hotel to give you a free drink at bar 
when i say the hotel is as stunning as the views 
to our pleasant surprise we were upgraded to one of their best suites 
your basic dull and comfortable business hotel 
with small counter space and the shower was a little tight but not unworkable 
nice touch 
spacious and the beds are really good 
this is your average business hotel 
a long queue was formed at 2 pm 
the metro brings you everywhere 
clean room and most importantly excellent service by the hotel associates 
everything is good but the room is suitable for business 
cafe 's and room service were all top notchcon 's 
it 's a lovely and lively area 
the bathroom was big enough and the shower was good 
it 's a very short walk to the metro staton under the mainline station and you can be 
overall the villa is very comfortable 
shuttle bus from the airport is less than 20 minutes and costs s 9 per person 
it is confortable with a small living room and big bath room 
when requesting for my complimentary parking 
own beach front 
we wished we 'd stayed longer 
and welcome cookies with their names written in chocolate the children were sold right away 
biggest issue- badly nickel and dime on extra costs 
service was very good and food was good 
the other one with maybe the most comfortable king bed we experienced in a luxury hotel but both identical in 
would we mind having supper from a shorter menu in one of the lounges 
great business hotel - great buffet for breakfast and great room service food 
living room are very spacious 
although there was only a rain shower head - tough for girls trying to avoid getting their hair wet without 
the property has excellent location which is away from the hustle bustle of the city 
eventually there was just soft drinks there 
great river front location in what i considered to be an older more personal world 
room 104 overlooking the ocean was lovely - very quiet fantastic plunge pool and outdoor living area to rest and 
picked up at the airport great 
a serious shortage of electrical outlets in the room 
the service and attention to detail at this property was just outstanding 
the main area is uber trendy which probably explains why i found it impossible to have a professional discussion with 
we had a big 40' lcd tv and the sweet sleeper bed with great linens and du 
only 1 small grip is that the pool is advertised heated and on the two occasions we tried it was 
excellent bed in separate bedroom 
hotel has carpark space only for members 
well located hotel and rooms fine - nothing flash but good value 
having your own dipping pool is great for enhancing the romantic experience of your stay 
very old hotel 
good bistro 
nice hotel in good location 
a private garden with 2 loungers and a decent sized dipping pool ( of which the temperature was 
the buffet was large and inviting and had a good selection of both western and chinese cuisine 
high floor is always better 
very nice hotel in a fantastic location 
the subway is a 5 min walk away 
efficient check in staff and everyone we met though out the stay was excellent 
mattress very soft and dipping in the middle 
good helpful staff 
42eur was excellent value 
the rooms are large and the facilities are what you 'd normally expect from a hilton 
prompt room service 
free parking and free wifi 
taxi or metro everytime you want to go out 
the lobby is now bright and more usualable with great use of spaces for individuals 
the great drinks and nibblies every night 
if you like to sleep with the windows open ( and this hotel is great because the windows open all 
we stayed at pounamu for 3 nights in a lower front 1 bedroom . 
it has a great view across lake wakatipu to the mountains 
i work in many different hotels around the world participating at conferences and training events 
it would be nice if they would have choices on a lower price scale on offer as well 
with extra pillows available in the room 
the hotel is some way out of the city but there is a tube station - stadion - 
location is convenient to train - 20 minutes to city center 
on the up side , our rain shower was possibly the best shower , with really good pressure , 
very good food options and the staff are helpful and very attentive 
i stayed here for two nights in november for a conference we had at the convention centre 
room only had a shower which was fine 
food is very good too and bar is very nice 
the restaurants are expensive 
many good restaurants and lounges in the tower itself 
the service is friendly and prompt and the hotel grounds nice and clean as well 
service is top notch 
this is a lovely old property with some classy art deco touches that just oozes comfort 
valet parking is complimentary but can be quite a wait if your timing is not right 
breakfast is good ( french touch ) 
i was offered a welcome drink 
firstly i feel cheated for paying a higher price for the west lake avenue view room 
front bar closes early ( birght lights switched on at midnight to drive you out ) 
given that there are still many international hotel in hangzhou 
anyway dublin is n't a big city and everything is within walking distance 
great hotel we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel . 
the front desk staff was friendly and accomodating 
the lobby area of the hotel together with the bar and restaurant are very grand 
the bus stops right in front of the hotel and at 10pm with luggages 
windows not double glazed so there is street noise 
there was a good work desk and wired internet connectivity 
for 13 euros round trip 
great airport hotel 
service at the hotel was friendly and helpful -- polite 
just have it arranged at the front desk 
i do not find such warm hospitality in europe that is domain of asia 
the views of the bay and the city 
food was good but like all buffets a little pricing 
a very good airport hotel 
public areas are beautiful 
the location on the green and 5 min walk to shopping is great 
the interior of the hotel is a victim of the design fad that hit many buildings in the 70 
i checked my bags with the bell desk as we had a late night flight and they were incredibly kind 
the lobby is all very stylish 
glass pod elevators and tiled flooring popular in big hotels from a past era 
if you want a more traditional business hotel or a quiet relaxing hotel 
the only address to stayin when you 're in town 
the location is fabulous and the restaurant down by the creek is beautiful 
i stayed here for two nights last week for business 
excellent value ! 
service was good overall 
i was there during happy hours for two nights and they offered different themes 
the bathroom had a continuous fan that was loud enough to be a white noise source to block out sounds 
there are some terrific restaurants in the area 
l'auberge de sedona may be the right resort for you 
the staffs were nice 
there are many excellent restaurants within walking distance so i did not sample the hotel dining 
the restaurants where excellent 
the gym on the atrium level is nice for a hotel 
the hotel is a typical aloft product with the major difference being the restaurant attached to the lobby 
rooms are decently spacious 
as i am super sensitiv with my hearing being on the third floor made a massive difference 
roof top swimming pool 
some of the rooms we rented had a very nice view over the ferryweel building and the waterfront 
lobby - small lobby 
it 's still a good value for money since a room at this novotel costs almost 
top notch 
i would rate it higher than top hotels in europe 
there was very little variance each day but overall the quality of the items was solid 
though the toilet has one 
heavenly bed and top notch restaurant and in-dining services 
white table linens for breakfast and great service with the best fresh coffee 
rooms are stylish and new though leaning more on the smaller size side 
breakfast is excellent price is average but good money for the service received 
we got free upgraded to deluxe room 
the laundry was late returning and i could never get the heat warm enough in the room 
a small pool and a small gym 
it is located in the very city center 
and nearest bts station is around 20mins away by foot 
good bar area and good though expensive restaurant 
breakfast area is nice and selection average-good 
or free wifi as stated in other reviews 
- staff should tell guests there is complimentary bus to bts- staff accuse me taking items from room 
4 5not in the city centre but next to the u-bahn 
free internet access 
clone red to the metro 
however if you are visiting disneyland with your family it definitely has the best location available 
first of all its a 2min walk from mall of emirates and hence u are super close 
a credit to the general manager 
it 's a long walk with small kids 
front desk staff not that friendly 
- the suite was spacious and clean with 2 bathrooms and 2 separate toilets 
the suite layout is spacious and well thought out with only one caveat 
i last stayed here in jan 2006 and there is no doubt 
when we came back the bed itself was very comfortable 
of 10mins will bring you to the nearest shopping mall and the famous erawan shrine 
and meals on the 19th floor dining room were good 
so they use a real gym next door 
also private entrance to dca and a short walk to dl 
after deboarding a long flight from amsterdam to bangkok 
the breakfast room at the top of historic building has to be seen to be believed 
i have slept better at most 3 star hotels with super hard beds and paper thin walls 
check in was smooth and efficient . 
as is the case with many hotels in the uae where the staff is assembled from number of countries 
just like to add that this was just a personal experience that i we encountered but we had warmer reception 
we were checked-in by sunny who provided much-appreciated advice on sights and sounds to 
we loved the great services 
to the credit of the hotel and the general manager he met with me 
the room facilities met our expectations and the hotel restaurants in particular jojo 's for dinner and the 
i really enjoy good coffee and look forward to having that here next stay 
room is beautiful with comfortable bed and pillow 
the toiletries are definitely worth taking home and the water pressure in shower great 
which includes a large pool playground and the indoor facilities 
you can only take the elevator to the floor you are staying onall in all a great location with 
you feel at this great building so welcome by the very well trained 
a stunning reception area and beautiful rooms with great views 
the staff is very warm and hospitable 
located in a central location 
the staff are incredibly comfy and sweet and happy to help where they can 
hotel offer 2 complimentary drinks per person per night 
breakfast buffet was very good but wish they have more choices for hot food 
for us far too colorful and to busy comparing to the other sites in the hotel and secondly the sandwiches 
breakfast there was ok but nothing terrific altho i liked that they offered fresh juices 
light walls and dark furniture 
city location right next to ratchadamri bts station makes the st 
the resort is located on cape manza and in the midst of the onna-son resort strip 
the hotel 's beach is excellent 
there is a beach nearby the hotel 
my only problem with the area ( and common with a lot of washington ) is lack of restaurants 
i think this hotel is very centrally located with easy public transportation or walking options 
this was my second trip to mumbai 
the room was a good size and clean 
i stayed in this fabulous hotel for three nights this month -- beleive me its worth the price 
the pool is huge and ideal 
the room was large with a king size bed offerring a comfortable night 's sleep 
close to action for walking around with young family 
there 's a bar restaurant in the lobby which is good for food 
a different colored bed spread and the absence of plug-in ports underneath the tv 
hot foods 
beach side 
we enjoyed the setting and pool which was a nice respite after days of touring 
i put them in my luggage case and it smells so fresh 
the suite was very spacious and luxurious 
deluxe villa if you want to splurge - otherwise the roomsfacing the pool are also 
the room we had connecting one suite and one room with two twin beds

and a metro station is right next to the hotel

hotel breakfast is actually very good value for a hotel breakfast with a fantastic selection and you wo n 
a guest relations executive 
food is good and the service is excellent or the upstairs bar which the smaller sections or the very com 
the best suite in the hotel might be 438 
the hotel is across the street from the louvre 
do n't take top floor there were windy noises all night 
being 5 expect the mini bar and meals drinks to be expensive 
the front desk offered to move us to a different room which was better 
lobby and pool are excellent 
do an excellent job of making an ordinary sized room feel like a suite and this can be seen from 
or experience being escorted up to the front desk ( which seems to be the norm here as i witnessed 
we went to the front desk for check-in 
nice nostalgic hotel 
not to mention the bathroom ( i am a sucker for luxurious hotel bathroom ) with the only bathtub 
the high tea seems to be a favorite attraction but i did n't have time to try it 
great accommodation 
which is 1 stop away from central bts station siam 
the pool area was nice to relax at 
see a lot of pretty ladies try their high tea 
it does become very crowded during the day ( one big car park ) however when the crowds and organised 
we met one of the on duty managers and everybody else in front desk and customer service area was helpful 
also thought that the main areas could have been tidier 
the wifi and dvd player in one of the rooms did not work 
very good transit hotel near the airport 
the room is small 
temperature in the room is about 20 c 
for long staying guests 
the location just off of orchard road could n't be much better but what makes this property different 
location this hotel is great 
easy walking and clean rooms 
to the consternation of the front desk 
next to a mall 
getting there from the main station is rather easy since a train and a tram can make the ride in 
we also got a free late checkout and took a taxi to the airport on checking out 
complained to the front desk 
just be aware that the first floor rooms are very close to the pedestrian walk areas - you 'll 
decent hotel in an accessible location 
but then , it s the only choice available ! 
i recommend booking room-only and then using the nearby shopping mall that opens early to get some coffee 
the rooms are standard size and all come with double windows so the room is soundproof 
hotel room okay - breakfast very good - convienent to airport 
3 minutes covered walk 
all in all a very average hotel 
i would recommend getting a baggage trolley if you have large luggage since there is a trolley 
nice pool 
rooms are stylishly done with a mix of modern amenities and old style wooden furniture 
this hotel is built in a spectacular building in a great location in arequipa 
spacious and relaxingpros - friendly and helpful stay- location is close to the main street 
had a really nice junior suite which was quite spacious and could easily accommodate the luggage trolley we took 
professional and pleasant staff - concierge 
there is undercover parking which is included in the tariff 
the property is well located 
when my husband spoke to reception they were aware of what had occurred but we believe the hotel should have 
it will be good if menu can change for long stay customer like me 
upgraded us free of charge to their premium service 
malls nearby ( within walking distance ) 3 ) price is reasonablecon 's 1 ) could be 
there was free wireless internet in the atrium 
a 24 hour macdonalds is just a short walk away and has convenience stores nearby 
room ok but looking a bit tired . 
the usual high quality and standards that one expects of four seasons maintained here 
next to the train and mass rapid transit system 
hotel has great gym and pool area 
the free internet access is also a positive thing 
great rooms , and unbeatable service . 
a double bed was really comfy and slept so well 
ca n't possibly be 44 better hotels in town 
very good recognition of my spg platinum status and gave me a corner suite on higher floor 
as we arrived with a late flight we organized a car pick up for us 
ask for high floor 
the breakfast buffet was very good and the variety excellent 
beds were great 
this is my first ever trip to tokyo and most definitely not my last 
pretty good hotel in hat yai 
friendly staff and muslim friendly 
older style westin in an interesting neighborhood 
afternoon tea and pre meeting breakfasts coffee stations ) were unbelievably good 
i would rate the best hotel in hat yai 
they assisted with late checkout 
due to its relatively modest size and odd settings ( no shelves in the cabinets for example ) 
this hotel is great for it 's restaurants and lobby area 
she guided us to the pool restaurant and there they said they were closed till 12 
but i think the carpets need to be changed our room smelled musty 
on several nights there was construction taking place until after midnight 
it 's a bit of a shame as some of the staff are friendly ( the people who take 
the conrad in dubai is a fabulous luxury hotel 
their breakfast buffet is good as they offer a wide array of bread 
i always prefer to take my breakfast leisurely in a quiet corner 
everything being excelent from the service to the rooms to the restaurants to the cosmopolitan rooftop lounge 
despite being priority club members ( which means nothing at this establishment ) we will book the oberoi 
i arrived at 10pm and discovered all their restaurants were closed 
it is also the closest to the airport 
the front desk receptionists and the executive lounge staffs are very welcoming and helpful 
the roof top bar is absolutely astounding 
although the rooms are a little outdated they are clean and very well maintained 
the views from the rooftop pool and the breakfast terrace were just amazing 
the pool is great 
room was perhaps a little small for a family of 4 - we had two double beds 
very good hotel with excellent food and rooms although good 1 
wonderful business stay in geneva ! 
! 
and the free shuttle to v&a waterfront an important plus 
walking distance to everything with reasonable price 
somewhat larger than you might find elsewhere for the same price 
the pool was fabulous 
which is great for transportation elsewhere 
both public areas and the guest room were maintained to a high standard 
nice buffet breakfast - not cheap but they did n't charge for the kids so that worked out ok 
rooms are tastefully decorated 
location is great for shopping though it 's on the edge of the shopping area and not central 
very nice and personal touch 
the staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was comfortable 
( be careful about hotels above pubs in dublin 
the decor is fantastic and adds to the nostalgia of being in dublin 
all are interconnected but where you get dropped off at will dictate how long a walk you have 
huge bed 
although you are near to orchard street and various shopping malls ( singapore prices are not that cheap 
we were on the first floor facing a busy road with pubs very near by but the room was well 
general ambience was quite appealing with nice pool and central oasis area 
this place had a beautiful setting amongst rainforest type atmosphere 
but decor and comfort level not up par with newer shang properties elsewhere in asia 
the four points by sheraton is a very good business hotel next to the main sheraton hotel ( 
it was very clean and it had a really functional room 
on our first visit to kuwait we splurged out at four points 
the spa looks really nice and smells lovely of straw and eucalyptus 
very good value 
i shall be back on my next apr 8 birthday in same wing and will make a comeback to horizon 
lovely hotel in idyllic setting 
you will have space like heaters that you will have to turn on 
the service from staff and concierge are outstanding 
and some have outdoor hot tubs 
very nice property 
still one of the best hotels in singapore 
previous 'preferences' were not known ( had been on previous visits ) and advised club 
a beautiful property located across the road from the city of dreams and an oasis of tranquility in 
i 'll try to make this review short and sweet 
despite an old facilities but it was well maintained and the large compound with big swimming pool will catered 
lush gardens on a terrace hillside setting ! 
service at reception was fine and staff were helpful in arranging for our bags to be transported to the station 
comfortable and of good size 
everything restful and relaxing after your special climb at machu picchu 
but limited breakfast options 
the paradise in macau , there is simply no better place . 
i was given a table that had already been given to someone else 
the hotel is rustic in style set in beautiful gardens with rooms featuring tiles 
my family and i stayed at the boyue hotel for 5 nights and had a good stay overall 
there is lots of restaurants and super markets located close by and most restaurants have happy hours at about 1700 
good food 
we flew up to spend 2 days with friends from australia visiting boston and then new eng 
my room was on the 24th floor with great views over paris 
both hot and cold options which were very tasty 
stayed here for 3 nights on business recently ( was attending a conference at the nearby conference center ) 
but the place is a veritable ant-heap scurry of people , so many in 
the shower pressure was very strong ( though the hand-held shower head was inexplicably inflexible 
my first visit to this hotel was in 2001 when manchester united played in singapore 
the spa and other hotel facilities also very nice 
second the shower seems to be missing a glass panel as you manage to spray water all over the adjacent 
although you could hear the next room door opening and closing and i could hear the shower on the upper 
helpful and willing staff 
the beds were great 
the gallery in the lobby is so pleasant and you can drink as much champagne ( moet & ch 
expensive but good value 
there were elk grazing outside our window during the morning and that is hard to beat 
the bathroom was very small and the sink was actually located outside the bathroom 
we went to the main reception area to check in 
with delightful staff 
it was baking hot when we arrived and it took us a while to work out that you could open 
the staff are extremely helpful 
generous provision of electrical outlets 
food just about okay and although our arrival and registration were fine 
the lobby is a bit dark 
a great business hotel near the boston harbor and cbd 
sleep quality was very good 
no issues downloading netflix- bed was comfy with nice pillows- bathroom was large with a 
this waterfront hotel is ideally located near the seaport area and close to many restaurants 
went for business and the hotel itself was nice 
but very poor casino amenities 
which faced the street ( on the other side of the beach ) was beautiful 
great decor 
this hotel is very convenient to almost everything boston has to offer 
the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a bath and separate shower 
a front desk reinforcement did arrive when it became apparent that the queue was not moving 
plus the hotel has an abundance of pools which is a rare and nice feature 
arrival by cab is difficult due to the tram lines directly outside but check-in was efficient 
our most recent stay was in the valley wing for three nights and everything was simply perfect 
and tower wing - smaller rooms but great design 
interesting things to do nearby -we booked activities before we left australia - glad we did as 
bathroom reasonable size 
all our belongings and luggage in one room ( we had two rooms ) were completely cleaned out 
breakfast was plentiful after a good nights sleep in a very comfortable bed 
modern and good value 
view and beauty along with great accommodations is what you are looking for--then this place is for you 
with a well-equipped bathroom with bath tub and separate shower cabin 
i think we must 've had an upgrade as we had a two room suite with a lounge area 
all non alcoholic drinks and nespresso coffees are complimentary 
you will end up in a standard-sized hotel room ( ending in 05 
the bed was very comfortable 
very nice big room and bathroom and big comfortable bed 
the new play room for kids is huge with an indoor jungle gym 
when we returned back to our room in the evening 
i was only there overnight and it was corporate booked but i would think there have to be better options 
this wing is now houses reception and the hotels restaurants 
we loved our stay here and felt pampered and valued as guests by the wonderful setting 
i found it extremely unethical of them to sneak in additional charges and it was annoying that i had to 
the standard coffee & tea-making set in the room also includes a little saucer of the type 
the modern interior was fine but not what we expected 
little traffic from crowds and we could really enjoy ourselves 
some a bit less at the bar 
but well maintained with an excellent bed 
good gym with nicely spread out equipment 
my husband and i recently stayed here for 3 nights in mid-july 
i was given a horizon club room with my shangri-la hotel points to cover the 
the staff was really kind and the breakfast we got was ok 
internet was really good 
bathroom is clean 
service was good and affectionate however my only feedback would be to have a few more english speaking staff 
and would cost only 5 euros but the journey could take 45 mins 
the tv in the bathroom is a nice ides 
the only tip i would suggest was to look carefully for the free shuttle bus when you come out from 
if this is the area you want to be 
process was easy and we were given free access to the gym with my hhonours status 
good value in expensive tokyo rooms are a bit dated but clean and has all the amenities required 
price fare on conference rate 
the small gym has new equipment 
the hotel has a nice swimming pool and gym 
great view on the upper floor and cafe 
location is great but there are better hotels to stay at around the same area 
great value-for-money 
the room we had was clean if a little tired and maid service very good 
the main hotel restaurant was only open for breakfast where the choices were a cold buffet for 27 or a 
the front desk staff is helpful and the bartenders provide the right balance of interaction and leaving you alone 
welcoming front desk upon check-in 
the beds are really nice 
rooms are very spacious and beds are very comfortable 
needed an accessible room for that visit due to an injury and was given a very spacious room with a 
once when we hit the front desk 
with easy safe parking right next door and a great walk to the old town 
- ) the executive lounge was small & had no atmosphere whatsoever 
but the bottom line is that while the location is good 
the room very dated 
the breakfast buffet was very good and the hotel is completely renovated with parking below 
there are a lot better options in the area 
my mother especially appreciated the furnishings and the space in the rooms 
rooms are good size and from the higher floors you can see far to the city since surabaya 
one tip however is have dinner early as the restaurants all fill up by 7pm everyday 
vast public areas 
nice shower flow and hot water 
one thing that need to be reconsidered is to provide free internet in room 
comfortable with a balcony where one can get a view of tokyo night 
even its 2 other sister hotels nearby were also fully booked so all could do was to do air cleaning 
lousy service 
in the lobby floor there is a restaurant that serves breakfast in the morning 
the front desk staff will escort you to your room and check you in there with a handheld credit card 
but they need to address physical safety and food quality and service - if they do n't want to 
a small pool 
as at many larger hotels 
the property has everything you need and located to all the local venues 
as they use a different wifi just for the hotel staff 
this property is very spread out on the mountain side 
there were too many - the line at 8ish am was very long waiting for people to be seated 
internet was only at reception when we used it although it is supposed to be available at the restaurants and 
excellent staff yes this hotel probably needs a bit of an upgrade but the rooms are reasonably priced and 
the bed was not very comfortable 
the road to reach the hotel is hard and require 4x4 car the hotel is spread on a 
great restaurants and wine bar all within short walk ( 2 mins ) rooms are on the small side in 
perth accomodation so overpriced for its facilities 
staff was helpful and gave good tips 
all of the highest standards you will find in any major city around the world 
attention to detail rooms are well appointed with tasteful furnishings and gourmet snacks and complimentary breakfast 
breakfast left some room for improvement 
the white room or the 1 bedroom suites are worth that little extra 
beautiful studio room with a kitchenette and small balcony 
overall a reasonable value central hotel in belfast city centre but there is lots of choice in this 
good solid place to stay in belfast 
very good value at 60 
the staff is super friendly and the rooms and quite big and comfortable 
very good service and nice rooms 
with lovely villas to stay in 
a marked duvet atop a small bed with pillows that ranged from terrible to bearable 
the gym was good and the location was fine 
there are also a lot of dining options at the hotel ( in various price ranges ) 
walk to the back of the hotel & you will find several small restaurants & cafes 
sweet rooms with very huge private pool 
the olympic pool was also now off limits for relaxing due to the noise and workers nearby 
get down to lobby early or call them i advance b4 you get to the elevator 
just great one of very big hotel in the city and so close in just walking distance to convention center 
despite the front desk not being over customer friendly 
with all the amenities and a good room service 
it was a little overpriced but all the same star hotels in the area seemed to be comparative 
several dining options from diner to calfornia cuisine and poolside casual fare 
we were recently guests at the sukhothai 
i give the pool a big thumbs up 
pool is nice 
the precor gym was good 
the bathroom was spacious and modern 
we had a nice sized executive room with a view towards the lakes 
views are always nice from city side or valley side 
free internet access 
the front desk made it sound like it was a good thing as it feels spacious to have the wide 
the window does open a crack so you can get some fresh air 
with fluffy towels and bottles of water brought as soon as you mark a space 
the spa is fantastic and if you have time and the budget try the jasmine ritual 
the gym has new equipment and is huge 
the bathtub comes with funky lighting and is only separated by a flimsy curtain 
polite staffvery quick and efficient check-in and check-out servicerooms are tastefully 
and do n't miss the garden behind the main building -- a true tranquil oasis in the middle 
the pool is quiet big and the restaurant are delicious 
the lobby lounge closes at 9pm so you have to take anything after that hour in the bar and 
what you would expect from a good quality modern hotel room 
the pool was great and the staff was fantastic 
i have spent several nights at many of the ritz carlton properties around the world and would 
there was a closet between the toilet and the shower 
others at our table had already been served main meals 
the in-room shiatsu massage was one of the best i had in kyoto 
the spa was nice - i had a massage and the quality was very good and the prices not to 
the staff at reception we pleasant and helpful 
i would definitely stay here again 
a shower tap located at the back of the shower 
there is also a free shuttle to and from the airport 
clean lobby and roomsvery friendly front desk stafffast check-insmall but lively bar area in 
the juices were fresh and not tinned as in other hotels 
the decor is a little dark and so we found ourselves wanting to get outside because it did not matter 
has free shuttle to and fro 
bar drinks are expensive 
the hotel lobby 
which is great for trip planning and catching up with news in evenings etc 
the check in is after 2pm and check out is 11am 
there is n't a bustling lobby scene like some other hotels 
stayed here on vacation overnight from hong kong 
the infinity pool was fantastic and much bigger than other pool suites i 've had 
walking along shinjuku terrace city and across the bridge will lead one to the hotel 
the water was great for swimming 
in my bedroom had a comfortable table for work 
great selection of everything and decent coffee 
warm juice and only hard boiled eggs along with bacon etc 
and a reasonably well equipped gym 
nice lobby and very helpful staff 
was supported by a good hot item menu 
they will charge you for the unlimited drink plan ( m 34pp us 4 ) no matter what 
forget about breakfast choice- expensive 
the breakfast was surprising good and the good location make this place a good option 
the pool and the beach were nice 
swimming pool & facilities are luxurious & modern 
staff just great bar not overpriced will return 
the sea view rooms on the 4th floor were very nice and spacious with a great terrasse and 
the three bedroom villa with pool was amazing and the butler service perfect 
very helpful staff 
the room we booked was a suite with a sea view but got upgraded to delux due to the 
so the rooms are fine ( eg bunk-beds in the family room for the kids ) but 
spacious ( almost equivalent to the bedroom size ) bathroom with superstrong water pressure 
and the extra bed set up on the 2nd day 
hotel is near to jr station and shinjuku shinsen ( metro ) 
they better spend some time cleaning the tables or the dirty windows which are full with fingerprints 
basic accommodation close to bts 
a security guide is at the new wing and entrance of hotel 
good but not that great business hotel very close to shinjuku station and that helps a lot for 
the bathroom was clean and the water pressure strong 
the bathroom worked out great and the in room kitchen was clean and well equipped although we really made little 
super effective and quick checking in and out 
a market and supermarket close by and some good local restaurants too 
i was fascinated by a warning that you might find a gecko in the bedroom and they are harmless

10 minutes walk will lead you to yaletown where the greatest restaurants are located next to each 
strongly suggest the hotel invests in some security so guests feel safer 
the two bottles of complimentary water were dressed in material and the hair dryer was also in a lovely 
if the swimming pool can be cleaner and nicer 
a truly relaxing hotel that never quite seems full 
all you can see is walls and the little door with elephants 
both western and asian options were available 
the reception people were helpful and friendly 
but with a balcony and a good sized room 
that meant a very short stroll to nearby restaurants 
received a complementary mekong river cruise which was nice and a 20 min complementary massage too which i 
the hotel also has free wifi throughout 
on the days we stayed our room was really stuffy and hot 
30 second walk to the markets 
the accommodation is most comfortable and clean 
historic property with plenty of activities 
i recommend they throw a little paint on some the walls and change carpets here and there 
peaceful street in a busy town 
modern clean , but cold and noisy i had a room at the back of the hotel on level 5 
it is a grand old hotel 
breakfast had a combination of cereals and hot and cold items 
friendly check-in and as a bonus 
choose the club room option - you get breakfast and free internet 
room decor is old and depressing 
7 ) choose the east village for your log cabin- choose the west villgae for your igloo 
meals are available in the main house-delicious and daily menu changes 
and a tired hotel in places but with excellent facilities which saved me giving it 1 2 stars 
snowmobile and husky safaris were excellent 
just the first street over - convenient to all the excitement and hub-bub but 
it is very typical of hotels close to the airport but what makes it different for me is the swimming 
we wanted a hotel with free parking 
location is a key and good for shopping at night time not far from night bazaar ( paradise shopping 
it represents good value 
very comforable beds 
the toilet was like a portable-cabin ( really horrible ) 
there are some basic shopping and restaurants nearby ( but nothing special ) 
food options nearby are few though 
the pool area was attractive but again quite worn and with very basic changing facilities 
and was glad - the hotel is close to the airport ( very good for in-transit passengers 
shower good 
the only thing i can pick on is the mattress is so soft 
very good price - we also bought inclusive airport parking for two weeks - would definitely stay here again 
during the winter the hotel shuts off the ac and the hotel windows do not open 
very cheap as well as getting the next metro and train station hatton cross by free buses 
a little over priced most of the time 
they claimed they fixed it--but no it was n't & i had a cold shower the 1 
very cute and convenient hotel 
the front desk is working very well and the service that you get is more than you expect 
staff at the front desk were courteous but there was no offer of assistance with luggage and they 
great indian food but the dining room is a little strange not sure how to discribebit 
rooms were typical ibis- small but clean with nice bed 
decent room 
there is no free luggage holding facility 
just be sure to check anything you print there 
lovely contemporary style room but shower only ( no bath ) in standard room 
very handy in an airport hotel 
a good airport hotel - but not one of the best 
decent airport hotel with good service 
2 ) the menu in the restaurant was limited and not appealing 
free soft drinks and snacks 
the bed is the one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in and the pillows almost literally 
420 and 520 were quiet rooms without any real view but ideal for a good nights sleep 
there is wireless available via ozone paris 
the double bed room 
it is also easy for the metro - there is a stop close by at rue de bac 
i found the room already a little dated 
breakfast buffet is nice 
good clean hotel 
club lounge very poor 
everything in the room is great to the extent that one may opt to stay in-room a little 
great place to stay if you are going to canberra 
the set menu is 3 course or 475 dollars per person or 95 per personquality of the food is 
overall the hotel is very nice with some great restaurants and amenities 
i was tossing between few 5 star hotels to stay but decided here as it had good reviews and looked 
it 's a good quality hotel in a great location for business stays 
with a fluffy turtle on the bed and a duck in the bathtub - you ca n't help 
during the memorial day weekend we spent 4 wonderful nights at the setai and we simply loved every minute 
one of the best hotels i 've been to in my life 
it was a tad slow but more than adequate- efficient front desk staff ( well 
the beach is small but the pool area is quite nice 
room was not upgraded and no free wifi too 
it s reminiscent of a giant love boat cruise ship , most of the staff are the most miserable 
only stayed one night and the checkin was relatively simple and hassle free 
the restaurants serve excellent food and the service there is impeccable 
extremely spacious and very clean which is exactly what a tired traveller needs 
i was there when the temperatures were very cold and the unit was constantly making a lot of noise trying 
even in the corridor attaching the hotel to the station 
bathroom was decent sized 
bed and pillows excellent 
pool is nice and only the beach is below my expectation but the service is perfect as usual 
you are not just a number in this stylish boutique hotel 
but be warned it 's an old building so it 's quite a tight squeeze 
breakfast in the hotel was also plentiful and of good quality ( great coffee also ) 
we had a beautiful bi-level suite with a wonderful bed 
the main lobby building is nicely done in rustic chic with a polynesian flair 
so it was a really pleasant experience when we met with a clean and spacious room 
the floor was dusty with wood chips from the stove 
and the view of the valley at the breakfast room is amazing 
this is perhaps the best place to stay in phobjikha valley but that is not its only 
over the top luxury 
the conference facilities were excellent and the catering and service excellent 
from the lobby to the two restaurants are spacious 
the location is terrific - very serene and secluded - not always the most convenient for getting to 
overall a great couples weekend in a quiet residential area close to museum district 
endless cups of hot tea are served 
drinks were good 
the buffet breakfast is great and it is worthwhile to come on a sunday just for the breakfast brunch 
which is essential since the nights get very cold 
heating is with wood burning stoves in each room ( as long as the wood cutting is controlled 
we are not big beach goers and the fact that the beach is nothing to write home about was 
i just want to stress that it gave very good value for what they charged 
much like staying in the middle of the jungle with access to restaurants and a private beach at your fingertips 
bed was comfortable and the desk was a good size 
reforma so it was an nice walk 
this hotel also has a great fitness center 
the suite itself was spacious 
i stayed here for 2 nights and found it a great central hotel location 
this great guesthouse is really in keeping with the surroundings in melaka 
nice room with great shower but we were on the ground floor and there are no windows so it took 
the room is spacious also 
which was a very good size with a sizeable bathroom 
staff said that its rooftop is about the highest point in the city other than the duomo and one 
our breakfast server felt like a friend 
with confortable beds ans really nice pillows 
loved the quaint interior design , decor & furniture of the room which had the basic necessities . 
busted hot water both in the shower and the sink 
but the overall stay was nice 
the views that greet you from the hotel lounge and bar are just fantastic 
the hotel has both kinds of tea free of charge 
the room size is spacey and the balcony view is beautiful 
the closest airport 
make sure to do the tour of taquile and the floating islands and buy some of the crafts 
so for a decent hotel intown its the only one 
a wise solution may be to either take the airport express or leave at least 1 hr earlier than you 
you can enter the hotel 's parking either from pattaya 1 road ( beach road ) or 
the room was spacious & had all facilities you can expect from a good star hotel 
also - the windows are noise presistant 
it was a great stay made a little nicer by the bell hop 
we went to horizon on 34th floor which is a skybar and restaurant 
and modern furniture 
one uncushioned wooden chair -- all that would fit on the tiny balcony -- was delivered to each 
which was a full suite with kitchenette 
you will be dragging your suitcase several blocks to get to the hotel 
good choice if you wish to get away from the very touristy queenstown and the traffic problems 
view and good amenities of a 5 star building 
it was ridiculousfront desk needs needs more training and the kitchen staff by the pool are not friendly at 
you are less likely to get stuck in the bad traffic in the east 4th ring road 
there is a mall attached to the hotel that has many restaurants ( though language will be a challenge for 
rooms are very spread out and ours took a good 6 minutes to walk to from the lifts 
had an excellent room service breakfast 
breakfast spread was excellent and the japanses buffet was really good 
the bathroom had a separate shower room and wc area but no bathtub 
ask for a high floor to avoid traffic noise from main road 
spent four nights here in late february 2015 
near a few stores but definitely not near the center or near the main touristic attractions food 
but there are shops closely by 
updated floors are quite nice 
the lobby bar and the restaurant 
there are plenty of shops and shopping malls nearby 
can be a nightmare if clients are within city proper if you are taking cab because of terrible traffic and 
while it has a good view of the busy street below 
breakfast is good and there is an mrt just outside the hotel which makes transportation very easy 
the ladies at the 24th floor premium lounge are great ( a 5 star performance ) but there had 
as for breakfast being served in the front of the street , you are better walking a bit up 
children play area and kids pool just outside the spa 
good but rooms on the street are very noisy 
so pathetic- non smoking room but still can smell the strong cigarette smell 
rooms are beautiful and food is great at the restaurant 
there are also numerous food outlets and shops between this mall and the one across the street accessible via the 
make sure you call ahead to check that your rooms are ready 
with free wifi 
dinner prices very reasonable 
fresh orange juice at breakfast 
the concierge was very helpful 
i am a traveller who is a frequently found in international hotels and that include ihg properties 
the price might seem shocking for the size of room and quality of service you get 
i could access the club floor and therefore i was entitled to snacks and drinks all day long 
bedroom and large bathroom ( shower only ) 
really great beach opposite the property 
2 best things about this place for me is that it has 2 nice big pools to play around 
gym and indoor swimming pool is excellent 
it 's a huge resort -other possibilities were almost certainly available 
there is also the polo bar for a drink before or after dinner ( they have early and late 
at hors d'oeuvres hours the lounge serves sweet pastries and cakes as well as some as 
i must say there where a few little things that i thought where a nice touch 
the breakfst buffet is decent and hot food is cooked to order 
try spa in neighbouring indigo pearl - prices even higher 
although no 711 or familymart around a shipping center is close by with restaurants 
the restaurants are plentiful and they even have nobu 
all the staff were very pleasant and hard working 
visiting beijing after several years based on a previous visit 
we interacted with 5 different staff members and they were all humble 
they prices are really reasonable 
it turned out the check in agent had the layout wrong 
the room is an armani room 
the wood barr is also amazing 
the front desk did n't offer to move us as a result 
some of the shops are closed on sat and sun 
we stayed in a floor where back half the corridor was renovated while the front of the corridor was not 
the remote control is ugly and the television set-up is strangely one-dimensional - not many good 
probably best location in milan 
the rooms are small 
usually the highest floor might be the best but our room was on level 5 ( lobby on level 4 
room was small and its window overlooked the runway 
we heard no outside noise 
it is located in the corridor between the hotel lobby and the department store 
the breakfast buffet was ample and they had all the traditional irish favorites including scones which were really 
breaky and dining room is nice 
room 517 offers space and excellent views 
our room was big enough but the bathroom in particular was very aged ( and not in a good way 
our room had no open window as such so you could see the light of outside but you coud 
it was pretty convenient for public transportation as it was just a few meters from the train station and the 
was supposed to get an upgrade after enquiring at reception but was later told that someone did an override 
you may want to bring along an extra bar of soap from home 
we were able to walk to the harbor for the new year fireworks without having to look for cabs 
good value but we had expected finer food 
and having the chef cook at an outdoor grill is a nice touch to get everyone hungry 
the water stream from the shower was very small and not comfortable 
the staff was able to accommodate us and shifted our reservation dates without a penalty 
they have a cool bar out on the pier but it for some reason closes at sunset which to them 
breakfast was excellent with an extensive buffet and a la carte items such as eggs benny and 
rooms are on the small size but normal for europe 
we visited in february and the weather was fine 
not that great stay at another hotel im a platinum elite and stayed 86 nights in marriott so 
a harbour view room is a must 
the hotel is in a good location and has views of the harbour on one side only 
elizabeth is a main street and you can catch a bus there to anywhere in town so this is 
this hotel can compete with some of the top spg hotels i 've stayed at and 
excellent business perfect for the business traveler , conveniently located just off the strip between las vegas bl 
james station which offers convenient airport rail connections 
we have tried 2 times on various stays to use one of these and they never work 
the bed very comfortable 
i wish the rooms were bigger and the window was bigger 
so one had to get an hourly authorization and spend time in the lobby to use free wifi 
the deck was a perfect place to sit and have a drink while watching the sun set on a beautiful 
i choose it because of its beautiful location - you feel like you are miles away from the city but 
fabulous bathroom 
both stays were wonderful - i would not stay anywhere else in munich 
staff very friendly and accommodating 
this is a great old world hotel with some super service located bang in the middle of munich 
with separate table as chairs belonging to the room 
all cream and white with a beam and a reverse-v shape high ceiling 
room was spacious and comfortable although would have loved a better room view instead of a small window overlooking a 
the rooms are modern and the amenities very nice 
this is the right hotel 
the view over the water from the lobby was spectacular 
only 2 lifts available so you ought to be patient 
the property has great open view of the hong kong harbor 
the shower was incredibly powerful 
very personal touch and style 
service is excellent . 
first time i 've been unable to eat a hotel breakfast due to lack of space 
the hotel is on 2 fairly quiet streets and has a boutique and personal feel 
not really huge but acceptable for city hotels 
location is close to chinatown and downtown if you have a car 
rooms and service typical of a hyatt regency 
great location which enables a jog 
decent gym 
the interior design felt more basic then many other boutique hotel options in taipei but it was 
the bed was comfortable but the pillows not 
the hotel needs to address the issue of the slab of marble that one has to step over to get 
this is one of my favourite hotels whenever i am in sydney 
they gave us a voucher to two welcome drinks at the bar 
club lounge on level 21 has a great outlook over the park and on over the harbour and is a 
the negatives are as i said above that the bed is very hard and uncomfortable although this could have been 
the club is really terrific with great selections for both breakfast and evening fare in a beautiful setting 
10 return per person . 
i knew it was n't in the airport and the only hotel located in the airport is the so 
no view as i booked the city side room ( the cheaper one ) 
an amazing club lounge breakfast 
pretty bad experience coming in off a long flight 
the breakfast is expensive 
i rate 1 point short of 5 because at your service button in the phone doesnt quite work that well 
i was in a standard double bed room 
this is not a family hotel and this noise was n't appreciated as i noted that several guests complained 
for the city of sydney in a hotel of this standard that is almost unbeatable value 
room was a decent size but dated 
a little bit of it 's age but still very comfortable and impressive lobby 
very efficient staff and rooms are immaculate and large 
never seen a higher quality of toiletries in the bathroom before 
the pool is good however perhaps it needs more cleaning or used lesser chemical chlorine i do n't know 
still well maintained after our last trip 
good breakfast 
excellent gym and wonderful spa 
i tried the spa and the balinese massage was excellent 
paying for a poor service and being several miles from the terminal be better for customers 
it is attached to a decent sized shopping mall which was once called bsm and also a theme park 
great renovated rooms park & harbour views are the best the sheraton on the park has always been an 
very nice visit 
great modern bathrooms and nice decor 
this is a beautiful hotel in a great location with good staff 
possibly heathow 's best airport hotel 
but will add 8 pounds to the price of you room 
the room was attractive and a spacious bathroom with a good strong shower 
great and delicious breakfasts too 
beautiful balconies and the living area was massive 
the hotel is fantastic and the service matched 
it is not connected to the airport 
the drinks and food were priced as expected for an airport hotel of this rating 
dream on if you expect free parking 
why no designated twin bedded rooms in a new hotel 
paying for car parking for an overnighter is a rip off 
so we inserted earplugs and turned out the light - we had an early flight the next day 
positives were 30min free wifi and only 3 for the next 24 hours 
all the facilities you 'd need for an overnight 
the only thing i did n't like was having no opening windows 
otherwise this hotel will charge you through the nose 
modern with a large lcd tv 
bed was comfortable and room clean 
the beds are fantastic 
gorgeous fittings and amazing sauna steam room showers 
the king-sized bed was comfortable but cabinets and furniture appeared outdated and without sufficient lighting 
the breakfast buffet very crowded 
great place but dark bedrooms 
the water outside your window is nice 
the heated mirror over the full sink was only useful if you were 7foot tall and the sink had 
the gym was clean and spacious 
though there was balcony one could not see marina nor water 
the first words out of the front desk were i need a photo id and a credit card 
on ground facilities are very good - indoor heated pool and spa - separate weights and exercise rooms 
i stayed first time in this hotel more than 10 years back from those days till now shanghai 
but one of few acceptable options in berkeley 
the outlook from the room was magnificent as it overlooked the paro valley 
and in easy walking distance to many of istanbul 's landmarks 
amazingly huge and luxurious suite 
excellent selections including many fruit choices 
the little bar is a really nice touch and the staff are very friendly - happy to give you a 
this is an older property in a fantastic location 
breakfast buffet was adequate with choices of international ( continental 
excellent business hotel in great location 
the concierge staff was also helpful with package shipments 
very nice bar to enjoy live music and drinks 
the bathroom is very nice and large with a great walk in shower 
exec floor ( tower floor ) lounge is ok and has good variety of drinks to offer 
next to the coffee shop is a children 's playland room where youngsters can play while their parents 
since the club room breakfast floor 43 is only available for club rooms 
there is a nice coffee maker and bottled water ( the water is not safe to drink in this hotel 
my corner room decor is clean and well-appointed 
this hotel is a wonderful place to stay with very nice staff 
and rooms were a good size 
the breakfast buffet was good but not as good as the one in beijing 
meeting services were very strong 
on the right side of the hotel in order to avoid the mosque or the continuous building activities 
great executive lounge and good service overall 
good portion and reasonable price 
the executive lounge provided good service for breakfast and evening drinks 
the hotel staff are nice and attentative 
it 's a good-placed hotel in ubud 
very quiet rooms 
it always came decorated with coffee art which was such a nice touch for your morning coffee ( i always 
make those screens lockable ( for peace of mind 
aircon cold 
i would n't necessarily call it very cost-effective 
good firm bed 
will definitely stay again 
especially for a nightly bath 
rick of front desk and mr 
well appointed with a king bed and quiet 
nice room 
front desk very kindly allowed me to email them personally and then they printed it out in the office 
right in the center of all shops and restaurants and an easy 5 minute walk to the mrt 
if you are looking for a good central hotel that is moderately priced this is a good option 
assorted juices 
close enough to feel you are in the old town 
the room had all the expected items present - a large and comfortable bed ( with a pillow menu available 
took my other breakfasts outside the hotel 
the concierge service - beginning at the time you make your reservation - takes a lot of 
but beds comfortable and all facilities present 
did get to choose it from the great reviews here 
decent value for money ( by disney standards ) and we will be back 
wonderful restaurants - you may easily stay in this hotel for a week without even a slightest urge 
the resort was beautiful and service from the staff were absolutely amazing 
if you take the magical express in for free from the airport 
everything lit up at night and countless pools of various sizes and shapes 
all the staff were fantastic 
i wonder why people spend almost 700 a night there with lower quality return 
the grand floridian resort and spa is an exquisite disney resort with many wonderful amenitiess 
the bathroom large and modern 
the service was top notch and the location was near everything we wanted to do 
nice lobby and grounds 
the staff are friendly and all of the little touches are there in the room 
the shower is in the bath which i was disappointed with but it worked fine and the shower gel products 
i did not feel like a welcome guest and it 's not hospitable to charge people for things 
in room dining served cold tea with breakfast - a remarkable service error given what nobu hotel stands for 
nice hotel lobby and corridor 
good lighting 
beds are large with luxurious bedding 
the wifi is free 
the room and service are fine 
having stayed in this hotel several times i was without internet connection in the room for 3 days in early 
spacious hotel lounge and perfect for a few days in milan 
pillows were very comfortable 
the only thing i could really find to complain about was the size of the bathtub which is separate 
the towels are very plush and impressively monogrammed 
the pools are pretty good and my kids enjoyed them 
brilliant breakfast and very quick room service if you needed anything 
room is a nice size and and everything in working order 
the main rail and metro station is directly opposite 
club service was great and the vietnamese coffee is a must try 
the bathroom was clean and the shower had a strong water flow 
imaginative public areas and beautiful rooms with wonderful views across town 
rooms are good and clean but on smaller size 
we arrived the day before independence day and were actually planning a full day tour but they said that due 
- exec lounge too small for hotel and absolutely unkempt ( dishes plates and glasses left dirty 
the house reefs just outside the aquatic center provide some of the best sea life available around the island 
and good amenities in room 
services - as we expected in laid back area - are generally slower than what you normally experience in the 
in a good location 
amazing breakfasts 
also they should give free internet for the price 
restaurants and shopping right behind the hotel 
there 's even a diamond shopping center just opposite the cathedral 
the bed is very comfortable 
but the stair case is dangerous to walk down 
we also made use of their hot tub outside 
the lawn is in the sun the whole day and unless you 've explored the stairs at the far 
efficient standard city centre hotel 
go for the deluxe harbour spa rooms - great views 
weather was n't great when we were there so a bit too cold for the pool but the hot 
separate shower cubicle 
pool and gym at the hotel are excellent and really nice to have a dip at the end of a 
especially the vietnamese cold offer . 
the best hotel in the city which is n't saying much as the competition is thin 
a short walk takes you to all these places which are beautifully lit and very lively 
decent shower pressure but very average toiletries 
very nice hotel with good service 
n nwe ordered room service for dinner and the food was excellent 
the service is first class and access to the club lounge provides you with a great breakfast 
the owners and desk staff are very knowledgeable about the area 
where you will find great restaurants and bars 
front desk very helpful always 
8- the gym is amazing and the pool has transparent sides which makes it quite elegant 
i stayed 2 nights in mid october 
the long bar was a great pace for a drink and the breakfast n the morning was that bit extra 
good facilities 
centrally located business hotel 
although there is a nice dining table 
large room and bathroom with tub and separate shower 
the building is very well maintained and quite plush 
hot pot restaurants are straight in front - go to the one on the left ( the busiest one ) 
with the upgrade you also get free wifi in your room 
even the location is perfect 
the spa was good and the massage was very good 
shower and separate loo 
we did n't use the pool but it was a good size and looked fun 
and the price is of course lower than those hotels just a bridge away ( singapore ) but considerably 
in a nice relaxing space 
the cafe downstairs from the reception area is nice for afternoon tea 
the breakfast selection is amazing - one of the best that i have seen 
good choice of restaurants ) -very friendly and qualified staff ( specially thanks to the staff at customer relation 
free wifi is provided in common areas 
can only say in my opinion all would be happy visiting this resort 
but there was also an array of western dishes if you prefer that 
the parking is free 
new hotel in a great location 
there are nice little touches like complimentary shuttle 
and maybe he could have a firm word with his front desk staff 
booked for and was allocated a 'club room' on the 18th floor with lovely views towards 
convenient location very near the woodlands checkpoint 
signage to reception is poor when you come out of your room if you want to use the stairs 
the staff were very friendly and courteous 
a separate bathtub from the shower stall was much appreciated 
great spacious rooms with a spectacular antique interior superb service at the front desk 
great rooms food first class 
beautifully decorated 
very comfortable with large windows facing over the sea - great views 
many great restaurants 
and many major attractions 
quite a choice of restaurants and cafes available around notre dame so i did not try the hotel 
the club floor was a nice perk 
the wi-fi connectivity is also good 
it did n't help that the villa was a duplex and the bedroom in the attic was 
thick bath towels 
kedewe a nice department store is very close 
there is a small restaurant at the property and they sell some snacks 
could n't ask for more . 
i think i will make this hotel my home when visiting this city next 
will recommend this hotel - the concierge service is awesome 
the bathroom is split into a toilet and then the awesome japanese bath 
i was waived on guest amenities fee 
but very good value for the quality of the hotel and would consider it again next time i visit s 
and a large shower next to the soaking tub 
great hotel with excellent service staff 
upgrade your room category 
the bathroom was very nice 
the rooms are good size and the marble bathrooms are spacious and of very practical design wake up and the 
the room was incredibly quiet it overlooked the pool which one could see through a glass ceiling but not hear 
the reception spacious with plenty of seating 
the easy indoor access to the pru without going outdoors 
room was lovely and spacious and a pleasure to come back to after a day of being a tourist 
food terrific and they even heated the pool for us 
lima is a difficult city 
there is a starbucks on the first floor 
room was very small and dated - bathroom so small that you could barely move 
good location but poor hygenie 
the first three visits to the front desk were met with rudeness and an overall attitude of i could 
we get a tiny room and after much insistence could exchange for another of the same category 
this hotel formed the final part of our tour of mainland china and it compares very favourably with 
pay extra for a bigger room 
you pay much more than for better hotels in bigger cities 
mindy and lupita for making our stays memorable 
jia is beautifully designed and had some really nice touches 
lounge is open 
hotel has good facilities 
forget the concierge floor not worth the money 
on second floor 
10 mins walk to windsor house where there 's a whole floor dedicated to shops selling kids stuff 
this hotel is good only for its location in city center 
overall the rooms are fairly standard marriott look and feel 
the room and the resort was very nice 
standard size pillows were good quality 
the private plunge pool is what seals the deal - it 's just too darn convenient to have your 
this is such a perfect spot for couples who wants to clear their minds and enjoy the nature in 
we made this walk several times a day and realized by day two there was no longer the need to 
stay here during a heat wave in amsterdam and the pretty new hotel was able to keep the rooms 
nice breakfast 
the only atm in town was also just a block away 
room was very spacious with some basic facilities for self containment 
s were available from reception 
no doubt this is a good place to stay when visiting franz josef . 
the pool was not crowded ( pro-bowl weekend ) so you had your choice of loungers 
but it is right next to the excellent shopping waikiki has to offer and just seconds from the 
maybe just give guests unlimited 
but worth it in terms of service and beautiful atmosphere 
the new accommodation suites are refreshingly decorated and are clean and modern 
after ripping it off my toe i checked my bed and sure enough the bed looked like it had just 
high floor better 
two excellent restaurants - arianas ( italian ) and tables on the river ( new zealand 
having previously visited rotoroa 
the embassy suites is right on beachwalk street with quick and easy access to waikiki beach 
the only real bug i have is that they actively block your phone 3g network 
but brightly decorated and stylishly appointed 
very close to decent restaurants 
the hotel provided daily complimentary bottles of water 
it is a very typical novotel experience and a good spot to stay ( next t the 
the hotel also has an excellent pastry shop and the bar downstairs was busy and has live music playing on 
i would gladly return to the w when i next visit boston but also would consider other hotels in 
has a small basic gym 
do take the free shuttle from the airport---they are conveniently located as you exit passport control baggage claim 
but it was modern with good sized rooms 
plus a good couch in the main sitting area which was perfectly good for sleeping on 
food there is great and staff is very professional 
this was a good choice as driving in and out of the area is much easier than the downtown area 
the bar scene and music in the evening is good at this hotel and actually better than most of the 
it is such an excellent room 
within walking distance you can stroll around whereever something is to see in this great city 
with separate toilet 
nice and chic hotel 
it was good that front desk provided them when requested but perhaps they should 've provided in the first 
we freshened up and headed out towards chinatown nearby for our dinner 
close to chinatown so some good dining options 
south america and europe offer free internet and wi fi - just like toiletries 
food is good around the pool and staff is nice 
the overall service in the hotel is good but in my mind offers room for improvement 
location was not so central as they claim to be but if you like walking then it is fine 
i was at the 19th floor lower penthouse 
two bikes and two treadmills ) but the equipment is high quality and does the job of helping 
wifi in lobby but you have to pay in your room 
go to the restaurant and order properly from their menus . 
we had regency club rooms with an adjoining door 
not being in darling harbour and right in the city you can often get the rooms at a cheaper rate 
the jet ski hired on the beach offered very good value for money and i used this to enhance the 
the reception was very friendly 
this is increased in the legendary south beach spot 
the lounge area is large and the colour scheme really lovely 
the rooms are spotless and have good facilities for your needs kettle toaster etc 
bed was very comfortable and we got very good recommendations on the restaurants 
we encountered the gm walking around the property several times 
sleep quality was excellent like home 
i was very pleased with the room and plan to request this type on my next visit 
the room was lovely and spacious and the resort overall is very nice 
with free wifi 
average quality rooms but it all about location , location , location . 
arrived early sunday morning and both reception and concierge staff were excellent 
the room was ok - quite small with no view but it had everything i needed and the bathroom and 
the lobby is a bustle of activity even in the evening and it 's quite entertaining to watch 
no free internet in room 
the tv and internet were intermittent and after raising the issue 
but also for the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff which we encountered 
once ordered ( which i had to do by calling the front desk ) the chicken was overcooked and 
there are also a good number of nice restaurants as well as good fast food and shopping right out the 
the bar in the ground floor is awful 
high-end shopping mall with practically any store and restaurant type you could desire 
the lobby is on the 50th floor but the rooms are on the lower floors 
nice to be able to walk to many restaurants and shops close by 
check-in was a bit confusing as we arrived around the same time as check-out 
good location 
i was here with a small group conference in march 2013 
this is not located right in shopping or tourist areas 
brilliant breakfast with good customer service 
i like that there was a big mall right next to it 
the bath room was wow large 
upon arrival in the evening i could not open the suitcase out of which i needed a lot of things 
very nice with one of the largest beds i have ever seen 
then started hating the non- stop tourist crowds and guided tours in the lobby and all public areas 
housekeeping was really poor in the bathroom ( see images ) 
the decor was beautiful and not sterile 
our dinner was preceded by a very well run reception with nicely served fizz and canapes 
shakey pizza is 3 mins walk away and the big supermarket max value is also 5 mins walk away 
it helped that the restaurant staffs were extremely friendly and hospitable 
from the moment you enter the grand lobby and reception area you are swept up in a bygone era 
bed with bedding very outstanding and excellent asprey bathroom products 
there 's a family mart convenience store next door and it 's operating for 24 hours 
had a lovely afternoon tea as well as a dinner at the palm court and also enjoyed one of the 
there is a car hire desk in the hotel and there are always taxis outside 
it was renovated years ago and you can see the results in public common areas and the rooms as well 
the food hall downstairs in the hotel was a nice surprise and we ended up eating in there a few 
room servicing and door staff are all excellent however the service in the palm court is appalling for this level 
but as a normal tourist i would still prefer the other side of the river where you can find some 
nice bar with lightchanging chandeliers 
clean and high tech the area was 
and overall it is a terrific place to stay 
the facilities such as the gym and dining options are very good 
the roof top bar and their restaurant is also amazing 
in white marble 
this hotel is a really modern one 
restaurants great 
the resto cafe on thr ground floor does snacks and the lobby bar is comfy - if y 
the room had a king sized bed and then in a separate room ( w o a door between the 
the extra touch of slippers by the bed & sweets on the made bed was a nice touch 
tinny room ( and according to reception deluxe rooms are the biggest the hotel offer ) 
the chi-session was fine and in a very luxury room 
as some of the other reviews state this facility has had a recent major makeover 
excellent customer service . 
we had dinner in here the first night and the food was very nice but the service which took a 
huge balcony and two bathrooms 
i would be happy to pay if there is any extra fee for this but this is free of charge 
the hotel has a nice and help full staff 
place is spotless , luxuriously appointed and the staff is amazingly helpful and courteous 
the overall quality of the hotel is excellent 
i think this resort has one of the most beautiful grounds of any hotel in los cabos 
there was also unlimited mimosas and screwdrivers included in the full buffet which was awesome 
clean bathrooms 
the rooms are really in need of a change and they did mention this will be happening at the end 
the columbus is located from the harbour in the fontanville area of the city and is 
the lobby is also beautiful 
a nice touch 
excellent good quality hotel walking distance to everywhere not sure why it is only 3 i have stayed in 
the hotel foyer is impressive probably more so in winter when fireplaces are lit but the rooms are 
opening windows for fresh air 
the hotel could be refurbished to improve the quality and the standing of the stay 
hotel location is convenient for exploring prado or thyssen museums ( 5 min walking ) the 
the corridor has slightly worn carpets which i was not expecting but they are of a very unusual pattern 
the gym was very small with limited equipment ( 3 aerobic machines and light weights ) 
my husband and i spent two wonderful nights in this beautiful hotel in franschhoek 
great location in chiang mai next to the night market 
hot dishes too that were delicious and different from the usual fare 
the hotel was a bit tired but the club floor was pleasant enough 
walking distance to nice food 
i had to catch a cab to an airport hotel and the reception staff were kind enough to arrange one 
i was really happy staying here - the staff are all super friendly and nothing is too much trouble 
just wishing that they had bit more space in rooms to atleast open your luggage 
exec lounge staff friendly and helpful 
& is close to the river promenade & charming old shophousesbreakfast at the waterfront 
blanket and big pillow 
good value 
excellent service 
very small swimming pool 
they quoted higher price 
nice hotel and good value for money 
whom i have had the pleasure of knowing for some years is a consummate professional and leads an 
best value for caring for your car 
all the uk 's top stores within an easy stroll and when the tiredness kicks in or 
offering generous hot and cold snacks and a wide range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks 
block out blinds worked well 
rooms well appointed ( prefer those not overlooking directly on the main street as they are quieter 
with perhaps 15-20 different breads available 
it is localised now and there is the brand new pullman barely 100 yards away 
very good business hotel 
) and there are plenty of one-way and pedestrian only streets 
the staff is very friendly and helpful ( really ) 
there are other hotels nearby though that offer essentially the same quality of room and service for very reasonable prices 
luggage rack was in area behind the door with low wattage ceiling light which was inconvenient 
sleep quality was top notch with no noise or any other distractions 
convenient airport hotel with everything you need 
the suites are big and convenient but a bit worn out 
large in-room safe & normal amenities 
the rooms are pretty standard in size and style 
modern decor 
the bed was very comfy and the bathroom modern and clean to perfection 
whole foods and other shops and restaurants are also accessible through the back gate ( keycard required for 
good value but not great 
i used to live in hong kong and still did not realize how in the middle of nowhere 
the small shopping center are next to the hotel 
the lobby is located in the main building together with the bar and the restaurant 
mainly because of the wonderful garden and pool and the excellent customer service 
i did visit a friend who was booked into one elsewhere in the building and you could have been anywhere 
flam itself is a very small village but has a few scenic hikes 
there were several options at breakfast - cereal 
warm hospitality 
unfortunately we got a first floor side facing room with not much of a view 
it would probably have been worth the upgrade to get that 
we were struggling due to not making a booking and whilst our first two options were gone 
the bed is quite comfortable but the pillow is a bit flat 
very poor quality and not much of it 
including a very large shopping mall in case you want to treat yourself 
this was one of the first west hotels that opened after 1990 
good hotel for business in reading about 10 minutes walk from the station , i stayed on a saturday 
the front desk told me that my reservation did not include the boat tour ticket 
food is very good but i recommend dining in amalfi with excellent restaurants a short walk from the 
as we used the bus to get to the main train station and the zoo 
the property is conveniently located near a stop for the red line of the underground ( which takes you to 
the room was large and clean and comfortable 
hardly any airconditioning - never stay here in summer 
stadtmitte u-bahn station is only one block away 
once we found out how reasonable the taxis are in taipei we made more use of them 
restaurants are better than rooms 
entrance of the hotel exemplifies the favorite chinese style with golden dragons in the ceiling and big 
internet connection is availabe for a fee 
bed is very confortable 
but overall a good experience 
it is in a very safe neighborhood 
the shower is also a steam sauna 
verry good small hotel 
lobby is well decorated and very spacey reception is ok room was in a normal size but bathroom 
never seen such a huge buffet in my life 
rooms spacious with big bathrooms and separate showers 
so yes this is a very nice hotel which is located in the center of berlin mitte 
we had a nice suite with a large bed 
it 's not the custom in germany but hotels really should offer high speed wifi for free 
room service was fast and friendly 
we had dinner in bridges one night and although the raw seafood platter was extremely good 
full equipped kitchen 
there is a comfortable library lounge 
breakfast is a decent buffet with average service and little attention to detail ( e 
breakfast quality was average but the outsoor seating is a nice touch 
last time i came with my wife ( then fianc e ) for a romantic getaway 
the hotel is an amazing refuge of calm and luxury right at the heart of amsterdam 's infamous 
amazing property 
it 's a bit old and needs some touch ups but more than makes up with the facilities and 
the swimming pool is nice and huge 
a sofitel in a historical building 
restaurant for in-room dining was great 
downsides were the view of the police station car park from our windows and the poor breakfast but that 
the bathroom is also good 
we 've been to amsterdam a few times but stayed at different hotels 
conference facilities were adequate and service was helpful 
we did enjoy the managers reception in the wonderful open lobby and that 's also where we got our 
it is also recommended for the piano bar which is local meet-up bar for expats in 
why ca n't guests get these one floor below at the pool 
the in room amenities were great right down to the nespresso maker 
to melbourne avalon airport is about 30 mins by car from the hotel 
it is located next to the safari park so if that 's your thing than it would be 
but the gym is a big disappointment - tiny room and barely any equipment 
given that there was no backup generator i waited 15 minutes and used my 4g to carry on with 
worn down carpet 
towels soft and fluffy 
also the pool area is so small and really useless for a hotel of that size 
the redeeming feature is that the hotel is right across the street from whole foods 
the internet was non existent ( in my room at least ) breakfast was ok 
the rooftop pool is also very cool 
staff were very helpful and the hotel had a very cool vibe about it 
staff was kind and checkin checkout was easy and very fast 
very good for the price 
the hotel pool is a little on the small side but still adequate 
however the room was disappointing- dont like twin beds and the bathroom was outdated but clean nevertheless 
the living room was separated from the bedroom by a long dresser that had a lamp and a very 
the pool is so small that you wonder why they still have it 
it was awful so i moved higher up to a room off the street with one small window that did 
decent prices and delicious free tapas with drinks - and the breakfast 
i typically choose quaint historic hotels 
( just because you are on holiday - the locals are not going to stop going to work or social 
a shame as the selection was actually pretty good ( avoid the oj tho 
and the front desk staff were just ok ( except for the nice guy finding us another room ) 
i found it too uncomfortable to get a decent nights sleep 
the concept of the lounge is a very good one and is extremely hospitable with one being able to 
good size bathroom and toilet room as well as a large selection of hair and body soaps 
wish we were staying longer 
this is your alpha romeo of hotels . 
extremely convenient ! 
the bed was comfortable but the pillows were way too soft 
not to repeat the last few reviews - but rather to add 
the bathroom is spacious with a very large shower 
beautiful building with a modern elegant interior 
staff were friendly and the bed was very comfortable 
this is definitely one of the best hotels in berlin 
her proactive emails really made the stays extra comfortable 
tidy with small kitchenette 
das stue is one of my favourite hotels of all time 
the bed was comfy and the location is quite central to the cbd 
rooms are reasonably sized and quiet 
will cost you like 1000 a night 
the park and the restaurant downtown areahad a privilege room 
fit offers great classes and next door is the heavenly away spa where you are spoiled with an extensive selection 
unfortunately we did n't have the chance to make use of the pool in the villa due 
receptionist very friendly and check in process is fast 
like all hotels in the express brand a buffet breakfast is complimentary 
make sure you book a room on the beach side 
its near the airport and there is a free shuttle bus on the half hour 
ca n't recommend higher as a hotel close to the airport with frequent shuttle run to the airport 
this hotel is a real hidden gem 
when you search the other hotels close to the airport 
plus the hotel car park and the villas in front of us 
i loved the outdoor shower 
you can get the free shuttle bus which runs every 30 mins 
let down by poor staff attitude 
the internet is very slow and sometimes unresponsive 
we were told that the free internet that was indicated with our reservation could not be honored and we would 
bus was on time at 0445 for our ride back to the airport which is about 10 mins away 
there 's a lovely grassy area with plenty of loungs and th esnorkeling 
food in the cafe had a few local specials 
the complimentary breakfast was a plusthe airport shuttle is useful but never appears to run on time which 
they told us to wait longer 
rooms were a good standard and the breakfast really accommodated all needs 
within walking distance to the beach which is fantastic to walk along and enjoy the sunset 
we got room service one afternoon and the food was decent enough for room service 
only negative is that you had to pay for wifi in your room and only had 30 mins free in 
keep in mind that this hotel is a bit dated 
huge wardrobe space and a great covered balcony with table and chairs and fantastic view 
the view from the patio of the main lobby is magnificent 
the bathroom was the size of some smaller hotel rooms i 've stayed in and had windows all round 
i stayed at the hotel for four nights -- first impressions were a bit cautious given the age and condition 
really nice pool and spa area 
with a deep corner tub 
) - would be a shame if such a beautiful property deteriorates quickly 
it has cottages which are pretty large is size 
good tea and coffee making facilities with cold milk in the fridge which is a bonus these days 
extremely good food - i try to be vegetarian and am sick of the usual indian food options such 
the bathroom amenities are nice 
a little dated with free parking and great pool 
which was worth the extra few dollars 
ihg top quality 
great food and cocktails and you have a winning combination 
marvellous staff and a brilliant central location 
i stayed here for a global conference and then extended a couple of days as well 
the gym is excellent 
we stayed in a king spa river room the first two nights and then for the last night moved into 
it was an excellent value 
staff of reception really friendly 
there is one large outdoor pool and a hot tub that seats about twelve people 
the grounds are kept immaculate by the hard working staff & the beach setting is just perfect 
powerful showers 
i love hotel indoor swimming pool 
we ended up parking further than where we should 
without traffic you can probably make it to the airport in around 15 minutes and even in the worst traffic 
the hallmark of great service is anticipating your clients needs and this is well demonstrated at the ritz car 
we had a ground floor mountain view room with a small patio 
great location but very average hotel 
overall rooms are pretty standard and conservative 
no new soap or shampoo 
with a short walk to all the beauties of the old town 
restaurant options were decent but room service pretty good for once 
good city centre location ( though a little dodgy ) - useful en route to few days work at 
the stay at the itc maurya is always exciting since it has perhaps one of the best 
superb bar and service . 
excellent housekeeping and room service 
especially the luxury ones 
will definitely stay here again 
the beds are hard but thats standard in china 
the only drawback is access to taxi quickl 
the bathroom clearly used to have a bath which was lost in the refurbishment so its shower only 
we booked for cormorant fishing and liu san jie impression with the desk and all 
the public bar alternative was especially fine 
it 's pretty good value 
the best restaurants in india 
the windows were good and shut out the noise 
the hotel lobby is also very nice with its high ceiling painted with mauryan art 
beautiful room and fabulously helpful staff 
the room was good size and very clean 
the lobby is stunning with the ceiling painting being the focus point 
service was great as well and food quality was high and everything came on time 
the room is large the bathroom is fully equipped with toiletries and bath robes 
the bathroom was n't clean 
there was a nice large pool with pool bar offering a good cocktail menu 
the hotel has multiple internet plans but you have to chose the slower one if you are an spg 
luckily the staff were very accommodating with changing our room as well as giving us an upgrade 
the hotel is only about 14 km away from the international airport 
the shuttle ride to the airport was much better 
keeping the traditional touch with a lot of paintings on its high ceiling is a good touch 
excellent facilities and friendly staff 
situated right next to the hotel is a fabulous shopping mall as modern as anywhere you will find in 
for an airport hotel 
this was just a bad night in the bar i think 
the main dining room is magnificent with the color scheme and decor and the historic building 
at the itc one desk was extremely helpful during my stay 
a guest shower room and a really nice touch is the little office area off the sitting room and bedroom 
the front desk and concierge were so kind and helpful during our visit 
the ground-flour restaurant meant for breakfast was full so we were asked to go to the rooftop 
with both a tub and a shower ( and it is a superb shower ) 
i had mentioned when booking that it was our wedding anniversary and special occasions are obviously duly noted 
this time for a week due to a conference at the hotel 
the hotel staff are amazingly helpful and quick to try and resolve any issues 
one woukd expect an airport hotel tp staff their front desk with english speaking people 
the restaurant was excellent and the bar is a must go 
there 's easy access to the toasty water for a swim in a protected area 
our room had a glass screen dividing the two plus a curtain which you could pull across the window if 
good swimming pool 
the food in the lounge was good 
and the wangfujing pedestrian street is nearby 
nice little gym 
the convention center for the runners expo was a quarter mile away ( easy walk ) and the traffic 
this doubletree is like most doubletrees an older property with adequate accommodations 
the mercure is in fact located in the middle of downtown narita which is a good thing 
meals very nice paid 30 pp extra great experience 
some free weights 
the restaurants provided a good range of meals and the 'ivy' restaurant in particular was a favourite 
my niece loved the kids club and swimming pools . 
free wifi is only for 30 minutes per day 
good gym and an excellent pool deck 
more and more hotels are no longer doing fitted sheets and going with the most absurd practice of folding the 
full sized fridge 
good bath tub 
the hotel gym is also stands out 
dallas is very spread out so i am not sure there is a best area to stay but this 
we stayed at the delta for two nights over new years and really enjoyed it 
this is a great hotel location in downtown dallas really close to the train stations that run all the 
what a great hotel 
this was the first time i stayed there with my family ( wife 2 kids ) during our 3- 
only downside is there is n't much dinning options nearby so i ended up with room service 
did have a pre-dinner drink up on roof top bar - great views on a sunny evening 
a great shower with water 
albeit the hot items could have been a little hotter 
we were visiting on a quick weekend away and the hotel is the first stop on the 747 airlink 
i would look at other options closer in to the city 
roof terrace bar is great as others have said 
considering this is supposed to be a smoke free lobby 
breakfast and dinner buffets had a good but not lavish selection 
their lounge and restaurants were great 
this was our first visit to kuala lumpur but we have stayed at other shangri la 
there are lots of electrical outlets and the bathroom is modern 
also food was quite bad in particular the frozen dim sum 
as mentioned there is no free wifi 
and food quality good 
the rooms are quiet 
clean rooms 
the location and the bathroom was my favourite part of the stay 
this was odd , as the evening cabaret singer was still performing . 
very comfortable and upscale night 
so check your bill on check ot 
i just found the decor in the rooms to be a little dated and that the furnishings overall needed 
i must come back to this hotel again when i travel to kl again 
enjoyed the bar and the food which was very fresh and staff were chatty which i always 
loud and busy entrance at night 
clean and wifi was included 
the lobby is a bit dark ( sometimes hard for the eyes to adjust especially when coming in from a 
i stay in the wow suite which was great for the room and the balcony 
the bed and the service matter most to me 
it has a very spacious gym and decent pool 
a good selection of bars and eateries and the lunchtime buffet is exceptional with the biggest range and 
) we opted to have room service instead of the restaurant breakfast due to time constraints 
room and property were wonderful 
asien and indian food 
this property offers large swimming pools and a water park designed for the kids 
a quick visit to the shangri la and the difference is evident 
i do n't think that a better location could be possible 
had lost and found locating the missing items safe in custody 
but then no outdoor seating probably 
maybe worth mentioning that they also have a range of villas as well as the traditional hotel rooms for 
waterslides good fun 
i love countries where you get top notch international five star quality for a budget price 
the bathroom was also a good size and had a separate bathtub and shower 
recommended for those with kids as they will enjoy the different pools and activities of the waterpark 
there is also a rest room adjacent to these with water and drinks available 
so it usually leads to a wet bathroom floor 
30 am which got us to the airport in good time 
30 am at the latest to avoid the bad traffic 
the plus here is that you have access to the taj village too 
i was staying in the sister hotel ( pullman ) next door 
it is a beautiful property with great views 
my wife commented that her dish was awful and the laksa that i ordered was incomparably 
the bar at the higher level off the shore is so ideal 
the private villa with a garden was quiet and secluded to give the privacy needed 
all are completely set to make their guests feel at home and their friendliness and professionalism was exemplary - 
exposed brick finish left it looking very low quality 
moment you enter to warm smiles you are dwarfed by the huge number of people crowding its 
the pool is located on the roof top 
very good value and very good service from the all the staff in all departments 
the check in process and staff are really good but the food at duke 's breakfast and the 
but the star has to be hannah in the restaurant , in particular at breakfast service . 
and it is easy to walk to the honolulu zoo or waikiki aquarium 
i usually stay at the traders but fancied a change this year 
the gym was 24 hours and the pool was great 
the beach is lovely and the water is warm 
i love hotel with huge bathroom and huge bathtub 
i agree with others on one price issue -- stop the crap about the compulsory resort free providing guests what 
big bed that had the right firmness and big pillow 
what a beautiful hotel - we had an ocean front room and the view was to die for 
dukes bar and resteraunt on the lower floor offers great food and entertainment 
on holiday i love a relaxing decadent breakfast in a five star hotel with my husband as we never 
the pool is very small but why would you swim there when the beautiful beach is just footsteps away 
the hotel has an excellent position - max 10 minutes walk to klcc 
the balcony just opens up 
the room was a tiny corner room miles from the elevator small with little lighting - seemed almost dinghy 
overall good value for money esp when the foreign x change is in our favour 
the hotel is good 
they have limited options in terms of what they can do 
we had afternoon tea one day 
the pool was good 
from the moment we walked through the front door the standard of service was exceptional 
has mcdonald 's across the road with tram station just outside 
choice of pillows and everything you would ever need included 
came back at 1pm and room was not ready despite request for room make at 9am 
the classic white building sits steps from the tyne and offers views of the contemporary art museum and a 
parking is at the multistorey behind the hotel on sandgate and currently costs 10 per 
remarkably good value for money 
bathroom was great with a powerful rain shower 
a taxi is a good option at less busy times 
so it 's not possible to have daylight and a little privacy at the same time - when i 
at a strategic location with easy access to taxis 
central location - walk to monorail and towers 
the bathroom was tiny--you could n't fit two people in there standing up--it 's 
nothing to complain about as the renovations likely fixed some issues such as not having plugs near the bed 
the cocktails are pretty good 
great groundsservice at front desk awful and miserablefor the prices they should clean the rooms daily 
you could probably find a better place to stay in lorne 
but i guess as it is a big property and is probably half empty during the winter months that it 
the apartment was very clean and very comfortable nice kitchen 
splendid complex right on the beach 
good price for what you get especially the club louage is very good 
affordable parking 
recommend the 1st nation exhibits at the museum and calgary tower is worth a visit 
it was a great stay 
the room appeared clean but still 
if you want to partake in any activities you can dive or surf 
pool area nice 
we also ate once for dinner and the food was very good 
the location is excellent with ready access to good restaurants and bars plus a very short walk to the convention 
yet big enough to offer fantastic facilities 
petronas towers and menara tower are both walkable though if you head to menara via 
the twin towers is a 5minute walk 
but the concierge quickly got this organized for us 
great value 
excellent service 
and the lounge on the executive floor was truly a sad excuse of a lounge where the soft drinks fridge 
big room 
the only other slight niggle was that there was very little in the way of seating in the 
even price is good value 
i think better options are available in this city at better prices 
view on the top floor facing the pool 
for international cuisines 
the concierge and other staff members are outstanding 
a reliable taxi is always availableother than that 
as with all good hotels 
molton brown products were also an excellent touch 
the front desk staff was great 
ours had a really strong musty smell though which was quite unpleasant 
i found the suite to be spacious and nice 
the rate i paid really a good value for money 
the grounds of the hotel are great for picture taking too 
this was mentioned in a previous post with the manager saying immediate action would be taken 
which has a nice clubby feel and good drinks 
big roomnice bathroomfree wifi ( for some spg ) lots of food drink promotionshotel restaurant 
as mentioned since it is an early departure 
the best thing this hotel has going for it is the location really and fortunately if you are eating out 
the hotel lobby is spacious and do not provide a lounge area for people to wait for friends or just 
the hotel is big ( probably a bit too big for our liking ) and located approximately halfway between ang 
leading off to the breakfast room and stunning walled garden area 
only 1 glimmer of good in this stay - gino the concierge staff was super friendly 
a staff then served us a welcome drink with cold towels again 
go back to the hotel to relax and take a good lunch 
and very good water pressure and hot water 
the lobby and the bar area of the hotel are quite nice so when i checked in 
beds and pillows are comfortable and room service is effiencient and good quality 
it will cost you around 100 usd 
the pool is a beautiful combination of swimming areas and lily ponds and the gym is well equipped 
overall a very disappointing experience & i wo n't be staying here agin ! 
the views were nice from the beach but there are a lot of big cruise liners in and out 
hotel is run down with most of the furniture damaged and generally poorly maintained 
the location is nice and handy and grounds are amazing 
it is a really good property 
the second room located on the 4th floor overlooking the front was much better 
our room was very simple 
but excellent private beach is the highlight 
the location is unbeatable in st germain where there are cute little cafes and boutiques just a 
serviced apartment so you need to help yourself to clean towels etc 
my favorite part was the bathroom with all the marble and a lot of space for a small building 
or just take a tuk tuk to town which the concierge is happy to call for 
a separate bath and shower area ( with a rainfall shower head ) are nicely proportioned 
stay at the hilton next door 
the room are a little bit old but it was very clean and very confortable 
the staff are so friendly and professional - they go way beyond the call of duty - hospitality at its 
all the staff here were super friendly and helpful and willing to provide you with lots of good information to 
so needed to keep the windows closed for the noise even if my room was on to a very nice 
hotel is great for accessing the cbd and is opposite flinders station 
the views from this round-shaped tower are nice 
i was impressed by their outstanding customer service last time 
the special of the day at the restaurant is a great value dinner 
about 30 min walk if you are fast 
i would have preferred a good solid water flow coming out of my shower 
the refurbished and updated rooms offer all the amenities you might wish for 
as has been mentioned by others wi-fi is only available in the public area and was fairly slow 
we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was more like a junior suite with separate living room and 
rooms are comfortable with the major basic amenities but nothing luxurious 
breakfast spread is great and the rooms are very comfortable 
nothing to rave about . 
the front desk is behind a bar - it 's a creative concept and i like it - if 
the breakfast was excellent and we also had dinner in the main restaurant a few times - good food 
we did some shopping and found nice spot to eat and gave a drink 
with a good signal 
when you arrive at the airport you may be offered an upgraded room but they wo n't necessarily be 
there are some restaurants around the hotel but we did not try any of them preferring to try others elsewhere 
interesting touches like the safe hidden behind a painting is so quirky that it immediately reminds you of your biases 
the bathroom was clean and of a good size 
trams and walk to some very nice restaurants at south bank 
we loved the fact you can get into the tivoli gardens completely free by the back door of 
one of the best options in toronto 
location wise it 's not bad - opposite the main station 
room 14 is nicely decorated 
old historic building that feels a bit like an ocean liner 
the location is perfect for a weekend get away as everything is within walking distance 
i like the historic building and the idea that these hotels ( they used to be called canadian pac 
the pool was right on the water and at night they had a smores cookout over the fire 
a great value for money for the whole family 
the hotel is in a great convenient location - right opposite the railway station and easy walk to the major 
it has a nice gym 
still a standout landmark in toronto and great location for tourists . 
the villa was very clean and comfortable ( 3 tv 's 
i found the bed too soft during my stay as part of a group 
it 's an easy walk to shops 
which was a 2 min walk once you step out of the hotel 
loved the huge bathroom 
the menu is a little limited but offered good value with a 3 course being offered for 20 ( then 
upon entering the hotel it was very clean and staff very friendly and helpful 
my husband found the heavenly bed to be far too soft and woke with a sore back but other than 
nice big conference rooms 
friendly and efficient reception 
we stayed here last weekend and love everything about it 
the hotel itself is very nice in a quieter part of bali with lots of watersports on offer 
each of the two main pools has a bar with different happy hours 3-5 and 5-7 
if you are thinking of staying in muscat put this hotel on your preferredlist 
the sun lounge area is small and you can miss out on a pool side lounge at times 
the hotel is located in an excellent 
swimming pool is great for lap swim 
very junior staff 
the lobby is magnificent and food was very good in the buffet 
i 'd probably book elsewhere if there is a next time unless they raise their hospitality standards 
but its a nice beach to walk along 
someone was checking in - poor girl did n't know which way to turn while guests were becoming irritated 
very good internet access 
i 'm looking forward to my next visit to the westin in melbourne 
trader vic 's has a nice terrace facing the garden and the corniche and beach 
the hotel itself is very clean 
the location ca n't be better in the city of melbourne 
service was good but quit busy when ordering eggs 
the hotel is very well located in the city centre and opposite a major shopping mall with a great food 
we were late to nobu one night so the hotel kindly arranged for their car to drop us at 
downtown right opposite the paragon mall 
small but well equipped gym and pool 
one of melbourne best hotels 
we got a specialon bookings 
and the white walls are not so white anymore 
being back in australia i have been craving good steaks 
the wifi signal is strong and whevener you passby the lobby 
tea or coffee to your room for the time you arrange a wake up call 
it is as good as no window 
the hotel range rover will shuttle you around town for free in a radius of 10k - providing it 
the bathroom was spacious with a fabulous ( enclosed ) shower with hot water and great pressure - easily up 
do n't miss the high tea 
i would be delighted to stay here again 
needless to say the hotel has all the amenities from spa to conference rooms you may need 
from the moment we pulled up at valet parking the service was exceptional 
excellent hotel right next to the airport and within the casino complex 
i was in my room within 40 minutes of having landed at midnight and it was a relief to have 
we were for our annual conference 
in summer this could be extremely annoying if you want to capture some sunshine 
but the overall ambience is lively 
great business hotel 
the rooms are very basic with poor wifi 
in the heart of the upmarket shopping district of central melbourne 
my wife and i stayed at the metcourt for 1 night recently as our connecting flight was only the 
ask for a high floor with a cathedral view 
the gym and spa are amazing 
but the running machines were fine n nexec lounge on 8th 9th floor nthis was 
the lobby was quite busy at all times 
i used this hotel for airport transit 
the bathroom was very big too 
there was in room wifi which was free but very very slow 
this hotel is in a good location 
the decor throughout the public spaces and extending to the bedrooms is white gray brown and furniture design is equally 
there are two lounges - one on the 8th floor ( south tower ) and one on 
a quite perfect 3-night layover en route from bangkok to tehran 
fairly large bathroom 
the room was great too - excellent bathroom amenities and a wonderfully comfortable bed 
it could be a long wait in the cold weather at jfk 
all for a high floor room with superb views of west bay and its high rise buildings 
the hotel has a very large outside swimming pool 
this hotel will always hold a special place in my heart - only because it was the last room left 
awesome restaurants 
this hotel is located in a quiet street near lumine 2 and newoman 
everything from check-in to departure was top notch ! 
very good business location 
the intercontinental doha the city is a luxurious city center business hotel that repeatedly exceeds my expectation on 
staycation in doha our family were all due for the holiday but ca n't just yet so 
it 's an old building but is decorated quite nicely and although it was something of a trek to 
cross one small street 
the shinjuku express station is a short walk away 
the front desk staff ( ladies ) were all super-lovely every time i visited reception or rang 
there are loads of better options within a two minute walk 
the rooms are clean and well appointed 
it was never over crowded the pool was quiet 
first of all booking was easy and very prompt in replying to my inquiries 
the fire and ice style spa is good fun but go early or late to avoid crowds 
the food in the garden bar was nice and stay open until late 
lovely powerful shower and a huge comfy bed 
two bottles free water provided 
the location was excellent with delicious cheap eateries just outside & shopping was just across the street 
nice and clean on a high floor 
breakfast in the club lounge also good 
the area is a quiet residential close to la vaguada shopping mall which you can find many shops 
the pool is great too 
i would have thought the upkeep of such an area would be high on the priority list 
the whole room was superb 
executive rooms are on high floors although noice is not a issue in this hotel 
an amazing property and although in the middle of the bush very easy drive from newcastle about 50 minutes 
the bed was king size and lovely 
the staff are uniformly pleasant and friendly 
bar was good 
the bathroom is modern & a kind of modular construction with a good big bathtub that can fit one 
they are not fancy but acceptable options 
after a long flight 
super efficient room service and beautiful wine 
the bathroom was fine with a good shower and spa bath which was nice to have but the jets were 
the receptionist was polite 
the real issue is that you cannot even open a window 
the beds were clean and comfortable 
very satisfied overall 
very comfortable bed and pleasant bar area are all real positives and due to reasonable rate i would certainly stay 
the hotel is 2 minute walk from nianjiang rd east pedestrian shopping malls and a 15 - 
this is a bargain as many hotels in shanghai charge extra for this 
i did not find the hotel to be a convenient walking distance to either the subway or the forbidden city 
porter helped us with our heavy luggage 
it is quite likely one of the best options to stay in siem reap 
really good business hotel 
the hotel is a good property for its rating and price and has everything that it promises 
the service in the executive lounge is good 
a full rain shower etc 
and 10 minutes walk to mirota batik ( fixed but fair priced batik shopping ) and 
i liked the skybar and rooftop pool as you could see the beautiful sunset 
food is outstanding and very good value 
hotel is nice and staffs are friendly 
room huge clean well supplied with water towels etc 
located on the wangfujing avenue which is full with shops and restaurants and pretty close to 
free drinks ( free alcoholic ones between 5 and 7 pm ) and food 
nothing like checking to a hotel at 1am receiving a room upgrade and a friendly employee wanting you to 
good hotel with sustained level of service is hard to find 
but i mentioned to the server that i like my oatmeal warmer 
great private beach which is clean and the water is calm and clean as well 
stayed for a night during one of the business trips and while the location of hotel is decent 
the area around is fantastic for walks 
we were on the first floor with a great view of the pool and the ocean 
grille 66 is one of the better restaurants in the area 
very central- friendly helpful staff- good restaurantdislikes 
plenty of bars restaurants within 15 min walk 
the bathroom was roomy with a nice rain shower and tub 
if you get a room in the tower ( 6th floor or more ) you can have a romantic 
it made the whole dining experience very uncomfortable and there was not enough food to go around 
the hotel has a nice pool area and although not on the beach there is an hourly free shuttle service 
but even without that this did seem to be an excellent property 
the poor lighting in our suite - the duty manager had the voltage of our bedlamps increased 
there was a definite lack of things to do around the areagood for a one night stay however 
meant the noise from the bar across the street was so loud in our 4th floor room that 
food at pool bar for breakfast was very good and reasonably priced - server was excellent and very friendly 
the decor was bland and the towels were so small i think they must cater for small people 
a short ride from the airport and conveniently close to redondo beach 
our room had french doors and a little balcony so we were excited to have a room overlooking the town 
the rooms are of a good size with a very narrow balcony 
my room was nicely decorated & of good size 
pool size was good and it had 2 kinds of slides 
from the moment we stepped out of the taxi and into the open walled lobby we felt welcomed 
the bar is ok with good and quick service 
seems big mall still under construction next to the hotel 
rooms spacious and clean and the marriott bed gives you a guaranteed good rest 
but we found the food choice adequate though not pampering and the taste appropriate if not heavenly 
however it is the outside where this villa really does come into its own 
if you are willing to spend then do n't go for the regular rooms and opt for the villas 
swimming pool is good 
the staff all are excellent 
great sharer room the facilities and conditions of the room and premises itself is a little more worn out 
the pool was great 
room was decent with no separate shower bathtub 
they woke me up and the only way to stop them was to turn the heating unit off 
it left us feeling underwhelmed in what was on the surface a great hotel 
the new hotel restaurant that just opened is great but booked out that eve 
rooms were spacious and very stylish 
the pool area is immaculant and the place is so clean right through out 
the hotel is ideally located with access to the buses and there were a large number of cafes and restaurants 
the good thing however is that they offered 2 bottle of nutmeg drink and a traditional snack which is 
we were also given ginger lemon tea as a welcome drink which was quite comforting 
take the water bus up the grand canal for an inexpensive way to get to st marks and also for 
the spa was one of the best i 've been too - and i 've been to many 
shower gel cum shampoo ) was one of the lowest quality amongst similar priced hotels we have stayed 
f&b director shyam panvar and chief cheff sandeep made my wife 's 
nice for sightseeing and there is also supermarket near here 
room was nicely decorated - venetian style - and seemed quite big 
adequate breakfast . 
a 45 minute drive through the valley takes you to the gates of heaven - inside the big courtyard is 
an excellent buffet breakfast 
do n't forget it is city centre and there is appropriate behaviour to be respectedyou can use 
as well as eateries like pizza express and cafe rouge 
good quality breakfast ( although bacon was a little over-smoked 
and other amenities were all available making it easy to feel at home 
walls are too think 
new homey boutique hotel with character and loads of free perks ( grab and go breakfast 
could have more child friendly facilities ( 6ft pool depth all over 
has a grand luxury feel ( for birmingham ) 
i ca n't recommend the studio room ( which i had ) sadly the sink in the bathroom was 
had a nice refurbished room on 35th floor 
many thanks to tyta for looking after us so well and her lovely cocktails 
several chairs and several tvs throughout 
i am a hyatt globalist i inquired about an upgrade but was told nothing was available 
the reception staff were great and managed to find us a room earlier than our scheduled check-in which 
there were the usual tea & coffee making facilities and sachets of herbal teas or hot chocolate 
the food is excellent in both the hotels restaurants and there is a very good breakfast 
we were there during the beginning of the fifa world cup and they set up a big screen in 
a ping pong table and a healthy array of eating options nearby or in town and you have all 
dinner at the pepper tree restaurant is an amazing culinary experience 
unfortunately the city side is under major redevelopment 
the hotel is placed at the besch with a perfect scenery with fishboats out on the ses 
taylor and tally in the beautiful premier lounge that comes with great view and excellent service 
hotel look very beautiful but room layout is a little bit awkward ( i stay one night at room 
complimentary ice-blocks brought around to the pool ) - manager was very hands on and personally welcomes 
the service was amazing 
breakfast was excellent with a large buffet and choice of egg dish cooked to order 
we were there when there was something on and the roads where blocked off the day we were due to 
the room was large with modern d cor 
the breakfast is great but in my opinion limited and with less options compare to other hotels that i have 
the area of the rooms is really quiet 
ask for a room at tear of building as main road at front but not noisy 
which kind of set the bar too high 
it should not be so high on tripadvisor 's rating as really there are lots and lots 
family 2 bedroom apartment had everything you need and was reasonably clean 
if you are a light sleeper like me 
great apartment ( one bedroom ) 
four seasons is a lovely hotel 
the open kitchen is clean and fully equipped 
had a very early departure and staff prepared a breakfast to-go 
breakfast buffet is very nice and the eggs benefit is delicious 
like you sometimes get at larger hotels 
roomoverall the rooms are clean and very spacious 
as the hotel is so new 
the service and the food were also exceptional 
the room was not like the ones shown on here 
heading back to the airport a wheel chair was waiting and checkin uneventful 
heated pool 
the 100 food credit from american express platinum can only be used in the lobby bar for lunch or 
beautiful hotel but check your credit card 
so sometimes the wait can be long and the hallways for whatever reason are not air-conditioned 
on checkout the hotel accommodated our late checkout without any hassle 
he magnanimously offered us free desserts which we refused 
the gym is a room that has been converted to gym 
unless you open your balcony door 
the spa is good 
we enjoyed in la petit maison and the excellent buffet breakfast 
the rooms are a tad on the small side but very well decorated . 
big clean room with very comfortable beds and good linens 
took room 21 which was a good sized room & had a nice outlook over the city 
spacious room with high quality furniture fixtures and fittings 
i also found yesterday 's flannel screwed up and wet in the bath 
concierge provided good recommendations for food 
next door to provincial capital building and close to bc museum 
a nice pool 
the parliament building is just next door 
breakfast was a large buffet 
they said the hotel room were nice 
apertivo generous and very high quality -- especially the glassful of perfectly roasted hazelnuts 
the desk personnel nice 
overall great stay for a night and it is just easy to walk to the shopping mall nearby 
the staff in charge of concierge is very dangerous 
the staff is usually friendly and the front desk speaks fluently english so no issue 
the over-all ambience and facilities were very good and room was very comfortable 
clean and value for money 
it is indeed a grand old hotel 
we had dinner one night which was good 
the public areas were furnished to a high standard 
hotel staff are top of the industry and could b 5 star but would ruin ambience and friendly 
it is as other reviewers say an excellent little hotel and one i could thoroughly recommend 
very spacious and what a great shower in the bathroom 
not too large but a good enough size and very attractive between the surrounding trees 
great if you have an early flight 
the bed was very comfortable as was the temperature in the hotel 
lovely ambience as you are met in the lobby and main lounge 
travelers expect a good shower and a good sleep for an airport hotel 
node view across the airport and the standard amenities 
the good thing is the fast airport shuttle and the vey helpful lady driver who was really the only 
30 am ( a very short walk from hotel ) i 'm sure i felt betterthan the people 
the top floor skybar is the place-to-be and to-be-seen 
having the terminals 2 minutes away and being able to either land and go to this hotel or spend 
tea and cocktails for free 
modern accommodation in a part period part modern building 
there is also a comfortable guest lounge with bar 
the pool bar is one of the most interesting experiences - go see 
the terrace is a great spot to people watch and enjoy the sunshine 
a strange rule . 
we ate in the main bar and the food was oily and badly prepared 
i know the bar is one of the best in kl but the property is a hotel not a 
pancakes and the list can go on 
would definitely stay again to catch an early flight 
room and bathroom seemed clean 
it was right beside the nice park and the view of petronas was spectacular 
they recognized my gold status immediately and offered complimentary internet 
got there for a late checkin 
big downside in sky bar was trying to bag a table with best views 
the location is typical of an airport hotel 
but the convenience of staying right at the airport due to an unexpected overnight - and early morning flight - 
the swimming pool is small and the placing and design look awkward 
it 's my go to in sfo as i always have an early flight 
the added cost is worth it 
separate shower andtoilet room 
great great location 
comfortable and has good amenities 
room was a nice size 
our welcome drink 
high speed internet 
very close to the airport 
i took the terminal bus to the rental car area-- very easy 
italian restaurant was very nice with calamari and ravioli 
the gym on the lower floor is a complete facility 
if you need a hotel in the airport 
as in any airport hotel 
this is by far the impressive hotel with good service and comfortable stay 
also an excellent full leg massage is available across the road 
downmarket , dated ( really dated ) , worn , cold and impersonal . 
very high occupancy 
where i can be in the queue but someone can come from behind and serve the caucasian guests 
do n't forget what tower you are staying in 
overpriced dinners- 15-minute walk into town- restaurant shuttle had limited pick-up drop- 
fantastic view of the gorgeous petronas twin towers right from your bed 
hospitality was warm and attentive , food was actually well executed and very good . 
all the amenities you need and great bathroom 
the staff were very helpful and the rooms were spacious and clean 
perfect lunch hangout this was a perfect place to sit looking out on to the grand canal watching the 
which makes it real value in my books 
the rooms could maybe need an update and you can hear the people in the next room and the hall 
the walls were so thin that i could hear every conversation being had by neighbors on both sides 
the property is a fairly big one but we did n't feel like it was super busy which was 
bath shower and free wifi 
great what a hotel , style , location and view . 
arrival i arrived by taxi from the kl sentral taxi stand where i bought a coupon to 
all top notch 
and the line for coffee gets extremely long 
the breakfasts very good and dinners as good again 
well worth the visit and we will return 
the room is so spacious that it is still spacious after we got a baby crib and they open the 
parking was provided in the underground car park which was nice 
though i did wish the tropical pool was adults only and the lagoon pool was very suited to families 
corridors dirty 
etc ) and restaurants and direct access to the beach which is good for a dip or body surfing 
breakfast was great value 
one of the best in the city 
parking is administered by a third party 
) and delicious desserts 
we never did get to try out the pool but it was a standard square pool with no fuzz 
the check in was slow as the staff were busy chatting to each other 
there are one or two excellent pubs just up the road and there is very good transport into the city 
comfortable bed made for a great sleep until morning prayers started every morning at about 0600 
the room had a charming view over mayfair and the gardens outside and was stunningly decorated 
we did a long walk to the canal & meandered through to temple bar area on a sunny 
the location is fantastic across from the shopping centre and the stop for the sighseeing bus for the city 
the hotel is situated in a quite location only a few minutes from grosvenor square nad 
well worth a visit 
full with pleasant small details and wireless was free 
with the restaurants and bars of the suria centre within easy walking distance or accessible via the free hotel 
it was of a reasonable size 
excellent welcome in a lovely very clean hotel - rooms are large and well equiped and nice bathrooms 
good internet 
really good breakfast 
good bathroom 
a great array of breakfast choices 
traders beats for instance the mandarin oriental and is in my mind definitely worth its price 
there is a small park separating the towers and the hotel 
the hotel is very near to the center of the old city 
great location and the sky bar is pretty nice 
the room is nice but the noise needs to go 
this hotel lives up to the marriott-renaissance reputation 
i came to the lobby bar for a quick beverage and the service was prompt and efficient 
gym a little too small for the amount of equipment 
the pillow menu is great 
walked down to see receptionist busy on her iphone 
great bar and a nice restaurant 
lots of clean fluffy towels 
however they tried to charge me for the room service continental 
very nice hotel 
bathroom and bed were great and the gym was perfect for every level 
if you push too hard , the lock is jammed and no one can open it from either side 
they should have waited until the spa center was open to institute this new fee 
the hotel lobby lounge area was great with an extended outdoor seating area with firepits and water features 
i see a lack of the ongoing investment that a first class hotel needs- you could contrast the nearby 
spoke to the same receptionist but she did n't recall me 
overall a wonderful resort 
the bed was a meter off the floor ( perhaps normal in singapore ) on a blond wood frame 
great pool area and a beautiful beach 
the best in town 
servers patrol the beach regularly or you can raise the flag on your lounge chair to get beverages or 
it was clean and comfortable the beach superb and every member of the team were impressive 
high floor 
dated decor needs urgent renovation 
quiet area with very nice food - they even served champagne with afternoon tea 
everything about my stay was fantastic 
perhaps the reputation of being the best resort in the area has given them a little attitude 
although not huge in size 
hilton deansgate is about 15 min walk from the city center main shopping area 
so beware of higher floors if you dislike heights 
but with extensive shopping mall nearby 
it 's in a very quiet part of the lake with a beautiful inlet full of lotus 
inle princess like other similar hotels in myanmar 
with good views of the city and the lounge had a good food and drinks selection 
the gym and pool were both good and a nice way to relax after spending the day in the sing 
get a high floor ( 30 or 31 ) for view and also access to the executive lounge 
this is a truly outstanding hotel 
the lobby etc are modern 
the bad news is the resort is very close to the highway 
very cool lobby where they have free happy hour drinks and live music in the evening 
this hotel is within blocks of wonderful restaurants and the gaslamp area 
iron and ironing board and tea and coffee making facilities and free wi-fi 
very good hotel in downtown san diego 
- bathroom is modern and clean- only 2 minute walk to the airport and the to the rental car 
the bathroom sink had a separate hot and cold water faucet 
executive lounge was very good 
afternoon scones and then free alcoholic drinks at night 
had tried regent previously and to be honest regent is a better choice if you wanna bring a 
rooms need new carpet 
executive lounge ( service and variety ) was better than many hiltons , staff greetings were 
service needs improving but it is all good value if you are very busy in hk and do not 
they were well thought out and whilst only a queen bed 
150 for two nights including all taxes 
our room was on the second floor and was virtually silent from the noise of the street or nearby bars 
they always have snacks or fruit available 
an excellent hotel 
so the 2 small elevators in the lobby were jammed with people 
the only down side was the wifi connection , so slow it was really frustrating . 
but rooms are still very well maintained 
breakfast and dinner was good 
firstly the positives are that it is conveniently located near the airport and the cnr exhibition centre 
the pool is 20 meters long which is great for swimming laps 
cheap and convenient underground train system 
long waiting time ) 
the lounge on the 31 floor was great afternoon tea 
the rooms though are well laid out and has great views of the harbor on the higher floors 
the suite was very nice and spacious with a great view of the fountain 
and because most rooms are on little cul de sac corridors general corridor noise was non existent 
i would come back again as the ambiance was excellent 
i had a light lunch at oscars which was nice 
slightly out of the way for the main attractions but within walking distance to the star ferry 
there was also a mix-up when we checked in and then later went to our room to find 
i would not mind coming back here but i will get a higher room category which is at a higher 
with all areas quickly reached by taxi 
the price is not worth to get such a small room 
close to many sights and wonderful singapore sightseeing opportunities 
as one might expect for a resort setting like this 
somebody tried to design something 'different' on a low budget 
the king bed is very high but also very comfortable 
you have to come to the lobby for your free breakfast because they claim that it was too taxing to 
but it 's a very good value 4 star hotel 
it 's a easy walk to the mtr 
of course ) although all security people carrying guns right in front of the lobby 
the gym was acceptable however the free internet connection in the lobby was very poor and i failed to access 
the buffet offered in the hotel restaurant is a much better alternative 
the glass topped tables are scratched 
very dated decor pretty much throughout 
the one thing that spoil my stay more than anything was the barman in the goodies hotel bar 
the bathroom was clean and the beds were comfortable 
very dated lobby 
this is an awful date hotel that its hard to believe sheraton put their name to it 
or you could take a very short walk into the shopping mall or better still towards promenade m 
actually this property has one major plus point 
a relaxing pool and generally good food 
decent sized room 
the beds were nothing like published on the website 
rooms are clean and nicely decorated 
- location is great few minutes walk to grand palace 
shopping centre across the road and small restaurants close by 
do n't expect the frills of what you would normally expect from say a sheraton but what 
this was the first time we visit singapore and stay in this hotel 
i stayed here for 4 nights in one week time 
big and clean room 
instead expect to stay in a very unique place that transports you back in time 
the service was fantastic and they were more than helpful with directions 
the good hairdryer is in the closet not the bathroom ) breakfast was just ok and beds 
we were eligible for a complimentary upgrade 
great location and good value 
the view of the marina bay area was fantastic 
right outside the hotel is the metro station of restauradres and also the rossio train station 
front desk and concierge were both great making us reservations and suggesting things to see and do 
the ceilings had to be 30 feet high and the furnishings were fabulous 
room service is generally strong and bang on time and the cleaning is very good and efficient 
everything was of high quality with no expense spared and well beyond what you normally find in five star hotels 
on the good side shuttle service works 
mrt is close and taxis to everywhere from the front 
the front desk staff and doormen offered suggestions 
the beds are comfortable and the service is great 
and the group i was with had a good meal in the restaurant on our last evening 
but i reckon the conrad is the best in the area 
the resort is set in truly beautiful tropical gardens- stunning in every way 
high floors city side afford really good views 
guests are left with free wi-fi in local coffee shops and the conrad is left without 
we did complain and the hotel tried to make it up to us 
carpet was dirty molded along window edges 
jaigarh and amber forts ) which are all on the northern side of the city 
the bathroom was also well laid-out and the toiletries were pretty good 
pool clean ( one of the bulbs in the pool was fused and not been replaced the 2days web 
the conrad centennial was an oasis after a very long flight from toronto 
fantastic hotel in great location 
i do n't understand how housekeeping can overlook the fact that the balcony door wo n't open 
the water is crystal clear and the pool area is large and there are hundreds of lounge chairs for the 
the pool was wonderful ( but go early if you want to reserve a sunlounge ) 
the bathroom was clean and well lit 
very slow internet connection 
i have been staying here since it opened in the late 90s although i have stayed at other hotels 
stayed overnight pre conference 
especially the lagoon and pool which are very stunning 
i can safely say after 2 visits this hotel lives up to all the good reviews 
the pool area is and always has been great and the beach is a patrolled beach 
but was handled very professionally by the hotel staff 
this was a lower cost marriott but i was so happy with the quality of the hotel 
well prepared food 
but sharon stepped in and arranged a lovely dinner at one of the other hotel restaurants so she really 
it is a good quality hotel with good facilities and good service 
rooms on higher floor & facing water bodies give a nice view 
we have stayed here over 20 times and love the location and the renovation is great 
spent two days her as it is located centrally near station and airport 
we enjoyed sitting by the pool in the open restaurant 
we did move into the main building which i would suggest if you want to sleep but were given misinformation 
it is a rather large property - when you come around the corner and start in toward frigate bay 
you have to take taxis everywhere so the costs mount up quite quickly as there is a set fare for 
small but adequate gym 
you got nice building and facilities 
i had a nice corner room at the end of the hall - very large 
the front desk staff seemed nice and pleasant 
placed where it is perfect for the city centre 
the hotel rooms were very clean and came with complete bathroom amenities 
standard of rooms and price it 's difficult to beat 
good position near the shops 
good location for the city centre and train stations i needed a central hotel for several meetings in birmingham 
the housekeeping did not top up our shower foam shampoo throughout our 7-day stay 
one of the best hotels anywhere 
manager and colleague at the front desk 
the rooms were very well furnished but i do agree that it does give away a slight cheap holiday inn 
all nice facilities to have 
the bathroom was clean and adequate for our needs and the windows did a good job of shutting out the 
nice wall-mounted soap shampoo tho and fairly decent towels 
the palais has an indoor gym and pool 
the rest of the staff are excellent especially the concierge and the bell boys 
walk up the magnificent staircase to see the upstairs eatery 
a truly beautiful setting right on the promenade offers magically breathtaking panorama of the bay of angels 
the food at the restaurants is alright 
good sized lounge area and 2 pc 's 
the outdoor promenade versailles lounge is a wonderful location to start the night 
barcelona is a very walkable city and alexandra barcelona made it very convenient to enjoy 
well located boutique style hotel 
the deluxe double is plush and comfortable 
very friendly staff 
this is even more true when considering the price that you have to stay here 
and encountered a gentleman at the front desk named jeremy 
the air-con was terrible ( room was extremely hot ) and lastly the shower was dated 
people like him make all the difference in hotel restaurants which sometimes do n't have the personal touch outside 
good quality free wifi 
very good hotel with very helpful and friendly staff with good tips for local restaurants etc 
it 's like staying at a timeshare or something 
ask for high floor if requesting ocean view 
salad greens 
stunning oceanfront resort in beautiful santa barbara 
i was pleased only to be staying here one night as it was dreadful 
we often choose hotels for long weekend when they are on b c of the late check-out 
a good alternative outside of santa barbara 
we ate in all of the restaurants and had excellent meals 
great family friendly resort 
easy to get to with lots of shopping and good restaurants nearby 
breakfast food were good quality with very friendly service 
the buffet was good at breakfast but probably could have a few more options 
nice big lobby 
the grounds are lovely and breakfast by the pool was great during the warm weather of our stay 
we thoroughly enjoyed this spacious hotel on lovely grounds 
have stayed at the suite for two nights , our room was not on the executive floor which is fine 
a very memorable stay 
the guy who gives free tours of the historic hotel is over the top loud and a bit too dramatic 
she brought out tea and fresh orange juice 
try the view from the restaurant on the top floor 
there are also plenty of restaurants down the street and some look really nice 
this is one of the great hotels and in my opinion the best in cairo by some way 
location of the property had great access to both business and tourist locations 
tough to get such good quality in cairo 
the room on the 19th floor was nice 
our top floor room had a slopped wall due to the roof 
my experience was not good for the price paid - this is a a newish hotel - my particular 
recently completed renovation that seems to have balanced very well old and new 
the bathroom nightlight and the aircon night so we could sleep 
nice bar with good staff 
don t personally like the recent bar re-fit , far too modern but maybe i m not 
however climb the spiral staircase and you are faced with a very thin and somewhat tired corridor 
had dinner the evening before in the hotel and i found it overall good value 
very convenient being able to walk through from terminal 5 rather than start getting shuttle buses 
breakfast is good and the cooks are friendly but they need to do something about the shuttle service , 
super quiet with the walls concrete 
staying at one of the closer establishments might be more convenient 
drainage in the bathroom was poor and flooded quite badly after showering - a particular concern as 
you could probably ask for an extra rollaway bed 
followed the signs to the hotel and a short 5 min walk later i was in the lobby having 
we did n't try many of the amenities except for the club room - the vibe was a bit 
nice rooms and bathrooms . 
we left our luggage in the room and were able to get on the underground which is a short walk 
if a room smells like an ashtray 
the bathroom had n't had a deep cleaning 
dinner and drinks were ideal and the team had a pleasant time 
well lit and very nice bed bathroom 
service levels all round top notch 
the hotel bar was trendy with friendly waiters 
with sweeping views over the nearby lagoon and across to ( the eyesore that is ) beacon island 
the menu was limited and portions were not generous 
it is a minor issue because nobody would resist walking down the steps and jogging along the beautiful beach 
i stayed overnight before catching a train to the airport next morning 
this is the best airport hotel i have ever visited 
but the difference between hilton hotels was vast 
free mini bar refreshed every day was a nice touch 
very good breakfast 
we also ate in several restaurants in franscchoek which we were told was the gourmet 
its located right at terminal 5 so it takes 5 minutes to walk across for check-in to your 
at least they have real hotel service while other new hotels may only have limited reception 
the bath on the balcony was nice for an evening dip watching the world go by 
there was another pool on the same level as reception 
it is a short walk 
the infinity pool had an amazing view 
restaurants on property of high standard and great staff at riverside 
orange lake is a huge resort originally founded by kemmons wilson who founded and led holiday inn 
the room was quiet and very comfortable indeed with all amenities including complimentary tea coffee and water 
there is an easy 15-minute walk to the cathedral as well as central helsinki - or 
we were upgraded to a spacious two bedroom suite and the place was very good value for money 
the bathrooms are sone of the best around and fully stocked with luxury shampoo 
i ended up eating most at the indochine restaurant located on first floor due to the choices of 
try one of the smaller boutique hotels and you will have a more memorable stay 
they have very roomy elevators which is also appreciated with the load-o-luggage we 
the bathroom is big and spacious as well 
and an easy and free transfer on heathrow express to terminals 1 and 3 
toilet is big with shower only 
9 restaurants and some high end retail outlets 
this make-shift buffet included typical hot and cold breakfast foods 
corner room best 
comfortable and contained all the amenities one needs 
fridge with complimentary water 
if it does n't work then settle down for a long wait for tech support 
worth paying a bit more for the convenience of staying so close to heathrow 
rooms and bathrooms are excellent value though 
clean rooms and friendly staff all within minutes of terminal 5 
modern decor 
there are newer options in brisbane now 
i was very upset about it and very stressed by the extra cost 
the pool and sauna area is very nice ( kind of outdoors ) 
public areas in the hotel are small by comparison with other similar class hotels 
there is a nice pool alsostaff is professional 
and lots of good restaurants are only a few minutes walking distance away 
eggs cooked in rings not my favourite and no fresh omelette station 
very comfy bed and well appointed for business travelers in terms of work desk and connectivity 
conclusionthe sofitel is a good airport hotel for overnight transit stay 
we had an early flight so thought we would stay at the sofitel as it is attached to 
efficient and friendly checkin checkout 
has to decide if this resort is worth the money 
be sure to take train timetable from the hotel reception to plan your day 
reception desk very helpful 
if you are going on a cruise from venice this is an ideal and well priced hotel but please 
great for an early flight 
breakfast and meals enjoyable 
we did not realize how far a walk it was from queen street mall and the central rail station 
furnished to a high standard and a good size 
if the pool was heated and the price was right 
the food and cocktails were very nice especially the tempura which was light and fluffy 
whenever i encounter these experiences my conclusion is that the general manager is not doing his job 
the bathroom is small but modern and the shower was great - hot and powerful 
i would not recommend , nor return to this hotel and was very disappointed . 
salzach grill was limited menu but great quality 
including me ) had a quiet room to the back and the window opened all the way 
the hotel sacher salzburg is a historic hotel in this small 
but they run a morning shuttle to the airport for a nominal charge ( or free to hi elite members 
they even had an airport trolley and loaded our bags ready for us to roll over to the 
this was totally different from the other hotels in same category that we stayed during our trip this time 
but marie who was front desk in the morning was so helpful 
by far the best hotel at heathrow and if you want to start your holiday in style or 
urbana offers big space and absolutely giving great value for price we paid 
it is located right on the beach so that you can walk outside and access the beach 
the complimentary internet for both rooms is a plus to the overall experience 
i discussed this with a different receptionist on departure and got a more usable answer 
the property is a lovely 
our room had a private fireplace 
the front desk had attitude 
outside the grounds are very nice with lots of mature trees and well kept lawns though some of the 
one of which is above a very large sunken bath 
the room rate is a bit high now days but if you can afford it 
we paid 128 usd night for a superior room on the 17th floor with a large balcony and 
ideal for the regular traveller 
a typical airport hotel 
but the food was better than average buffet 
rooms were clean and modern 
good dinner buffet & set lunch & beautiful seaview from a large balcony 
the superior are slightly bigger but exactly with the same beds and bathroom 
next door to the hotel are simple but very good restaurants 
i tried the hotel lunch and the salad buffet was really excellent 
great location 
good to see that the breakfast was back to its extensive range 
the bathroom with shower was good 
i loved the modern style of the room which had everything you needed and plenty of storage space if you 
i would actually like to come back and spend a few days here for leisure and see it at its 
but a great friendly check-in 
overall good value and location for hope estate concerts 
the upstairs villas are nice but consider if you want to carry your cases up the stairs 
reasonably good value 
stayed in a 2 bedroom villa which was large and spacious with good amenities and once you got 
the facilities modern and the rooms a quiet calm 
fantastic city hotel with top shelf service 
the bed was soft and inviting 
good bar facilities 
and sorce restaurant is very expensive for what you get 
stayed in 2-rm villa next to golf course so this is also a good base for 
the property is gorgeous from the moment that you enter the gates and the living room lobby to the se 
i got a free room upgrade to a king deluxe- platinum members also get a free 15 euro 
with a new interior and new name this is a great location for the american hotel 
great facilities 
there is a microwave and small fridge 
known to provide the best eggs and breakfast in melbourne - that 's if you can tear yourself 
great location on collins street - lots of shopping and dining options nearby 
we stayed here on a brief one night layover prior to heading to schipol for our flight 
stayed for 2 nights including breaky and 3 course diner 
concert sting easy check in upgraded as i am spire elite . 
avoid staying here if you like a peaceful nights sleep 
the whole place radiates top quality 
however the hotel looks tired and dated 
located opposite trafalgar park and a 500m walk to the centre of nelson township this 
car parking on site . 
the hotel also has a really good fitness centre attached to it on level 9 
hotel has a nice cool pool 
and it is easy to walk to the falls 
this is a very nice hotel but it does come with a high price tag 
the well-appointed room was spacious and had true block-out blinds - really appreciated 
it is reasonably priced for a tourist area and the quality and view 
the room layout was good with well designed corner sofa and round table 
second , since spg has rebranded sheraton many of its properties some are now on par 
there was a small queue at check in and we were surprised at the sheer size of the hotel but 
it reinforced the excellent quality and service from all staff here 
the mini bar cabinet doors were crooked and furniture was drab 
the staff at the hotel were fantastic as well 
fast and efficient check in and received an upgrade to a family room so had a separate lounge and bedroom 
even though the common areas of the grand are beautiful with the craftsman style architecture 
the gym on the other hand was a good size 
the cast members in this property are excellent and strive to make the most of your stay 
the rooms are nicely decorated and the location is great 
non smoking 
the staff were very helpful and there was ample parking 
will be sure to stay here again next time i am in parramatta 
my room was quiet and the bed was very comfortable 
room had a great layout with separate lounge area with sofa bed 
getting the front desk to answer the phone was impossible 
recently modernised this is a high standard hotel with good amenities and staff 
walls made out of wafer biscuits so you can hear your next door neighbour snoring through the 
good pool and leisure facilities and really nice accommodation 
was a little taken by surprise by the number of small children running around the lobby and the general cac 
given the hotels specific location and the city 's attitude to cars in general this is worth 
but the cost of the room and there was no breakfast included for us 
did clear a table only reluctantly 
lots of silly mistakes . 
sand in the toilet was never cleaned from day 1 some positives that you would expect from a 5 star 
all the team are extremely friendly and helpful and thoroughly deserve hdv spending a bit of cash to 
i ca n't say for sure whether it was from the food we ate at the hotel as we 
and the ceiling speakers were hanging loose from their mounts 
decent value 
for 16 they will park it for you at the hotel across the road where you can park yourself for 
otherwise a great hotel experience from the organised chaos of the driveway to the comfortable beds and 
the chinese restaurant staff not happy i wanna make order because they wanna finish shift on time 
the hotel looks very new and modern 
it is a hyatt regency with great facilities 
fantastic facilities , close proximity to federation square and flinders st station . 
clean and spacious 
it is a perfect resort for a relaxing weekend retreat 
although the pool is too small for actual swimming 
excellent location of the hotel beautiful warm interiors and super team 
location is a block away from where you would want to be . 
beautiful pool area and a very good restaurant 
the room i was given was a corner room with a huge balcony ( very nice ) i would stay 
street noise is a factor to be considered 
small full kitchen 
the included breakfast was very good 
bit disappointed that our room was n't ready for more than an hour after published check-in time 
very good in size and neat n clean 
there are n't that many good restaurants in the area other than the limetree cafe so you 
but they gave me a free wifi code 
we had a nice sized room with ocean view 
extremely nice hotel in a beautiful city 
i suggest the management to look into these issues and freshen up the interiors asap 
the lobby was small 
i liked the electrically heated bed pads 
i was able to work and get a good nights sleep even with the sound of planes going into he 
while the hotel decor is a bit tired i found the room very comfortable and the front desk staff friendly 
friendly and helpful front desk staff 
the check in was simple and if you are a smoker 
it was one of the official hotels in the conference that i attended and for a 4-star hotel 
the rooms are excellent save for lack of a bath in the standard rooms and the fairly noisy aircondition 
however as previous people have stated the rooms are dated and could use a update 
there are some renovations underway and it was clean but there is a general lack of facilities ( no room 
overall good stay and value for money 
towels huge and thick and everything worked in our room 
in a small hidden street 
lots of dining options nearby 
book loads of rooms and they will upgrade you 
i ca n't help feeling 2 things - it rests on its laurels because it sits in the 
the bathroom is huge with a great shower and a tub next to a big window ( the towel warmer 
trendy friendly and with great shopping and places to stay and eat but this is not one of 
the concierge is one of the best we 've ever had the pleasure of working with 
room is well appointed with clean linens everyday 
stunning terrace right in the grand canal 
it was on a lower floor so the street noise was there - and although i live in the city 
an absolute delight getting treated to smiles on arrival is a great great feelingmy daughter absolutely enjoyed walking the 
i wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy more of the hotel and the city but next time for 
the electronic toilet with all its control buttons was a marvel 
front desk staff very friendly & informative 
there is a long entry way with a long rack for luggage 
( 6 ) loved the free phone calls back home- really cut down on my mobile phone bill and 
it was no surprise how beautiful this property was 
room was average clean 
the location is just perfect 
the level of the hospitality and room and amenities were top notch 
the free international phone calls is is fanatastic and allowed us to notify family of our save arrival 
i asked for special arrangement of flowers to be ordered and placed into our room prior to arrival 
anyway you can find other good options around eventually paying something more 
observed some mould clusters on the privacy screen and the anti slip rug 
got no use for that and for someone that just checked us in to an already occupied room the best 
nicely decorated with good a bathroom and plenty of hot water 
the only good thing is we were upgraded to a better room than we paid for and had a nice 
soft drinks 
we had a wonderful stay and highly recommend this hotel 
location about 15 minutes drive to the airport and they provide free shuttle 
which got me free internet and early evening drinks snacks 
did enjoy the hot tub in pool area as it calmed me after a sleepless night 
a great hotel away from bustling city 
clean large desk and exceeded my expectations 
or you can ride the free greenlink bus as well 
we booked a one bedroom apt 
however , after i came back home i was charged 2x for a total of 150 usd 
great gym 
coffee burnt 
food options are limited to hotel restaurants and a residential hawker street nearby 
but an adequate size 
downtown - nice hotel 
we never could visit the shops on the main street as whenever we came back from the day tour ( 
and a tired but clean toilet 
food options not only available on site ( inside the hotel ) 
sleeper sofa in living room as well as table with several chairs 
the hotel room was one of the biggest i 'd ever seen - the decor did n't wow 
i would actually stay for a couple of nights at this hotel as we enjoyed it 's proximity and 
very good wifi connection 
my highlight is the awesome rooftop pool for sunset and sunrise views 
with easy access to the mrt you can get anywhere in bangkok with ease 
she said that they ran out of deluxe rooms with king size bed 
good food choices for breakfast 
rooms were well appointed ( junior suite ) with all modern amenities and free wifi 
front desk and concierge very polite 
the lobby is huge and very elegant indeed 
it 's also a few steps away from don quijote ( which 24 hours ) so you 
there is a pretty cool bar ( where we ate well ) on the top floor with magnificent views of 
overall a very good stay with friendly and attentive staff and excellent food choices in the extensive buffet with 
the front desk staff looked harrassed but in fairness to them 
took the hotel 's shuttle car to nu sentral for lunch and some shopping before returning to 
a very good asian hospitality 
so we called and luckily got a room in this elegant and luxurious hotel 
the whole hotel operates like a good swiss clock 
the food is great as well 
the hotel is as you would expect being a st regis 
i would say that this property is a solid b a- business hotel--it is not a trend 
fine dining 
the bed was great and there were ample pillows 
lots of beers and the food and apps looked nice 
it can be such beautiful property 
a call to the front desk yielded an apology 
and the main level lobby bar is trendy with good light fare 
coffee shops etc - would recommend to go for the full board packages if available an excellent property for 
the wireless internet works very good at the loby area ( in the room they charge you for the 
pools and restaurants are generally in great form ( the pastry shop and dinner buffet are exceptional ) 
there are two big shopping centers very close by -- the sabco center and another very new mall whose 
when you go through a crowded and not so impressive reception to the big window facing the sea and the 
well worth the price for the view 
we had city view and in our room on the 13th floor ( out of 16 ) we heard 
you can find similar hotels at cheaper rates 
the laundry service was very good 
except that the 'upgrade' had a 4 floors higher view of the building site next door 
the obvious high point of this hotel is the setting 
the pool area itself is nice 
housekeeping explained the two 330ml complimentary bottles of water in the room were only replaced once a day 
but still very comfortable and a of a good size too 
of course such a fine an exclusive resort does not come cheap 
next time will try the spa and the inviting pool 
good location wit great beach and western style food bar 
get a valet to park you car which would set you back by p100 
- checkin was smooth & staff was friendly & helpful- the lobby is huge & feels warm with 
beach front really nice- but waves could get loud 
the bed is good and overall 
the bar serves great food and is very lively at night with expats and locals 
and near your unit it is two storey so if you have difficulty walking up stairs then perhaps a 
the bathroom was large and in good working order 
extremely enjoyable dining experience 
valet parking declined to accept cars to be valeted , the south parking was full . 
everything worked just fine in the bathroom 
the hotel is on the lake and you can walk to the city and shops and the lake very easily 
this is a large and busy hotel 
crisp linens and a view of the bay 
new carpets and bathrooms but overall ok 
the pool area is spacious and the buffet breakfast has the largest variety of food i have ever seen 
one slightly irritating thing is the standard wyndham policy of only providing one standard coffee sachet 
the buffet for breakfast was excellent quality and had a great selection 
the excellent and classy lobby bar 
however it has a really nice pool 
i called the front desk 
ask for the suite with murphy bed if you have business meeting the suite is fantastic with full living 
many rooms are occupied by tour groups and the breakfast room is crowded when it opens at 7 
the hotel is decorated in the style of the alhambra with details on the wall that you will 
and the views from the rooms and the terrace are fantastic 
n nthe hotel is a taxi ride away from the mall 
pool is somewhat small but good for laps 
we found that two single beds had been pushed together to effectively grant our request 
we enjoy an emperor suite with a beautiful pool- and sea- view 
the price was reasonable -- i tipped well and still got out of there for under 30 
be sure to ask the front desk on the best directions to leave for the next city you are going 
free internet access in the room is definitely a must as we are in the digital era not like in 
they remembered during the last visit i forgot to pack my toothbrush and had to ask for one 
the bathroom had a separate tub and shower which is always nice 
the breakfast buffet was fantastic and you are spoiled for choice with a wide offering of both western and modern 
most nights i got free parking opposite in olive st 
the hotel is connected to the subway and also linked to the airport express bus station which you can check 
bathroom clean with a separate shower and bathtub 
staff were friendly and service was good 
it covers less then half the city 
peel st and leigh st which consist of many charming little eateries just next to hotel 
the decor is a little on the dark side for my liking 
higher floors got better view 
generally good stay 
a bit dated property 
the hotel seems very nice and beautiful but unfortunately the restaurant didn t live up to my expectations 
customer service is exceptional 
security and quick service 
lovely hotel heated large outdoor swimming poolsecured nice people with big smiles even those who do n 
the huge restuarent behind the lobby is amazing and gorgeous 
very good rooms 
great luxury hotel and great service from the staff 
the hotel is situated very centrally just behind the central station and next to the hip new area 'k 
hence connectivity and food is not an issuehotel itself has a nice lounge bar with live music 
what a great property 
to top it off gravy was dropped onto a shirt and a waiter picked up bread with his hands and 
kal limousine took me from the airport to main hotel entrance 
greatthe next morning breakfast was tremendous 
it 's an expensive luxury but so 
and not at all stuffy atmosphere but in a private spacious setting 
the service was excellent and the ambience really relaxing 
as you can enjoy the view of the citysitting in the baththe out door bar is amazing 
overall i had the best sleep super quite rooms . 
free mini bar items 
there is a tiny mini mart right outside 
the indoor swimming pool is awesome 
also the executive lounge is very good 
perfect bath in room spa 
view was fantastic with a big balcony and the rooms were clean 
the business center located on the 3rd floor is well equipped and staff were very helpful 
the bed and pillows are comfortable 
there were a couple of cable channels available on tv and wifi was available at a small price 
best choice in jing-an district this was my 2nd time staying with the puli . 
with great beaches 
was just a short walk to the shops 
the pool was popular and the coffee shop downstairs is a real plus 
however the overall quality and service is worth the money you pay 
eventhough the staffs were nice 
people are very friendly and hospitality is really worth mentioning 
the concierge was extremely helpful with a great sense of humour 
nearby nanjing road west in pleasant weather is a lovely walk 
i booked for a massage at the last minute and the lady at the spa made every effort to accommodate 
it has to be said that the view is sensational and when they finish the construction works in the area 
this is really great for a city stay - it means that you can always get a bite to eat 
35 minutes for an omlette for the only customer in the restaurantthe room service menu is a bit 
because you may hear the chinese national ( country ) song music every morning 
the hotel is near many shopping malls and there are plenty of options for food if one chose to venture 
apart from the very comfortable accommodation we would like to say a huge thank you to all staff 
compared to five-stars with the same price more or less ( mercer and w ) - 
they served wide variety of food and the food quality was good 
internet can be used downstairs for free and parking is 40 day 
the king size bed was very comfortable 
three is that employees are like androids perfect brain but no hearth no warmess at all 
reservation and front desk staff are super efficient and the lobby has a glamorous feel 
plenty of shops and eateries nearby 
liked the bed and desk set up and the view was great 
but the room was a little old 
as it is so hard to find affordable parking anywhere in the city 
with a separate bidet and lovely agraria toiletries 
the view from the room was fantastic 
bed was fine and a good nights sleep was had 
it 's a good and convenient hotel if you have a conference at the hotel 
essentially the beach is a semi-private cove shared with amanpuri resort next door ( 
it is a great convention hotel 
feels old and some of the modern amenities you 'd expect from a 5 star hotel were sadly 
big busy business hotel 
the bathroom itself is actually a good size so it looks like a design fault 
i loved our private beach bungalow that was right on the beach 
the only difficulty is parking 
the gym was a big construction and so was the pool which is also at the same spot 
the tv did not work satisfactorily and the bed though comfortable did not lead to a good nights 
on several occasions we booked restaurants via the front desk but where not informed that restaurant cars ( as is 
we had panoramic view of the very quiet beach and the turquoise ocean 
but if you want to be in the city centre this is a great place to stay 
and if you 're in the lower floors 
all rooms have coffeemakers and safes 
all in all - great place to stay in one of the greates cities in the world 
the gps stops on the highway and the hotel is not easily visible 
rooms are good but missing a fridge . 
but old fixtures in bathrooms and generally feels tired 
but what can i say it is in awesome location 
then you are definitely going to have to pay for a taxi to get back to the hotel ( around 
firstly there is no mini fridge in the room 
the bathroom had a nice shower 
they told us to take a taxi and they covered the fare upon arrival 
fan made some loud noises when blowing in room 
there are several great restaurants in close proximity - riboville for great 
the executive lounge was very good and it was nice to watch the sunrise over the hills and town 
the area generally felt unsafe after dusk 
if you are looking for a reasonable prices room 
the executive lounge had a nice breakfast and other food most of the day 
this hotel is very clean and tidy 
the service was excellent 
you are not choosing it because it your first trip to florence and you are looking for a 
fast wifi 
the room furnishings and decor was contemporary and the bed linen was fresh and crisp 
a short walk from bahnhofstra e and the bellevue 
i checked into the spa early in the morning on saturday and had a fabulous aromatherapy massage 
the rooms are clean and well appointed but why would you be indoor anyway when queenstown has so much 
the main area decor is gorgeous and hotel rooms are exquisite 
the rooms are a good size with all of the amenity you would expect for a 4 star hotel 
everything about the room itself was fine 
lots of choices and truly very tasty dishes 
the property is very huge and green with lots of trees n plants making it even more prettier 
2 nights deluxe room & 1 night lake view room from 1 dec to 4 dec 
we could see the mountains and the city side part of the lake from the little balcony 
though a small window 
we came for our anniversary for the atmosphere and to have a relaxed and healthy short vacation weekend 
concierge and front desk staff were all very pleasant and helpful 
our room was all crisp modern lines and picture windows 
typical cold meats 
the bed was very comfortable and the linens clean and crisp 
they have a nice gym space and equipments and you can relax at the jacuzzi 
the service is decent and the rooms comfortable enough for a night before or after visiting taj 
a nice break from the chaos of agra room a bit musty , but otherwise nice . 
( for the extra waiting at check-in we were given complimentary drinks and spa for 2 after i 
again - if you are headed to agra do 2 nights like we did and enjoy the spa as 
always a perfect stay 
we were heading out on two occasions as a taxi was dropping people off and the staff refused to allow 
we stayed at a suite in the hotel and both the room and the service were first class 
this is an older property with plenty of character and excellent service 
the room was decent sized with a good king bed 
which i thought was a great bargain 
the king room was very comfortable with the all important plugs for phones at both bedsides 
since you can access the hotel from the airport or directly from the car rental drop off area 's 
if that s the case then splash out for the oberoi having also stayed there it is 
this hilton is quiet and features a restrained and tasteful decor 
hotels are regularly full up with guests so maybe they do n't have to be so attractive 
they arranged the shuttle bus transfer before my arrival and even though my flight was late they were still waiting 
lots of complimentary drinks in the room 
the property is very nicely done and offers a good experience of indian culture 
best aircon we had in india 
the lounge is excellent and has a generous closing time of 11pm 
but it was very good and the ambience was excellent 
the moment we arrived we were stunned by the beautiful entrance already 
rooms have a decent size 
the hotel is in an old palace but most of the rooms are in the newly built wing 
but the price is also very different so at a scaled down size we still get a very pleasant 
we found a great deal for a 3-night stay in one of the hotel 's courtyard suites 
the hotel is in the 16th and on a very quiet corner behind high walls 
the beach was clean 
5 for a days internet access seems churlish and the 10 breakfast a bit steep but 
this hotel offered every amenity imaginable 
the spa like toiletries are first class 
the property is stunning words and images ca n't describe it 
the view in the roof top is amazing 
a cute hotel 
me provides you with an attractive package for a weekend trip in summer 
good for the value 
there are better hotels 
great location hotel 
bigger than the usual hotels around 
the rooms have a decent size ( no smoking floors ) room service ok 
that lead out to the backyard garden with a humongous bath tub and the salt water plunge pool 
beds are very comfortable with nice linens 
rooms on the top floor have lovely terraces 
the pools are beautiful - especially the adult pool with the swim up bar 
slow free internet 
loved the bar above the main pool and the bar with billiards 
faulty showerhead 
took the narita express ( nex ) at 4000 yen round trip 
room is a good size but very sparse and old looking 
taken from the car straight to comfy chairs and were greeted by a number of staff including the 
a great visit 
walk from shinjuku station is very far with luggage 
it is an effort to find any open beach chairs unless you are there before 10 a 
the bus to town is only 75 cents each way 
one night stay was a nice surprise 
not that big but it does have a small kitchenette and laundry facilities which if you are staying a 
there was only one ultra thin blanket on the bed and an old acrylic one from the closet that we 
after brunch - you have 3 pools for a dip to get you focused in case u hadntoo 
we got a great hot deal which made it excellent value 
i think that it is a good 200 per night beach hotel but as you aprocach 300 there 
the beach is horrible and the resort can get crowded 
couple this with the rather flimsy room doors and you can get a noisy environment from outside your 
restore the budgets for maintenance and landscaping and the indigo pearl could return to being a pearl 
the pool area and the beach are the main resort draws 
the rates were relatively low which probably explains why it remains busy but there are a number of good alternatives 
with easy access to the beautiful nai yang beach 
separate toilet with curtain for a door and 2 wash basins 
free parking with plenty of covered spaces 
quick overnight stay 
i had to repeat the check-in process each day as the name on the room was wrong 
great food options and very good rooms 
beautifully finished with large tub bath and double shower 
our room was modernly decorated with amenities comparable to those of 5 star hotels 
i 've found that the shower drain is frequently clogged ( it is an old building ) and 
the chef could not even cook a proper omlette and the continental breakfast was very poor 
alcoholic drinks 
we booked in for one evening and had a very pretty room with an amazing bathroom walk in shower and 
the bathroom had a frosted glass wall and frosted glass sliding door 
and then rest at your hotel before setting off on a night out then this really is n't the 
i was fortunate to have the same cleaning staff each day 
the staff we met were all friendly and the bar area was great 
large bathroom and opened onto the terrace of the hotel - perfect for travelling with our dog 
i appreciated the energy-saving water heater and the key-operated power cooled the room quickly 
you 'll be spending a great deal of time engaging in the resort 's activities and the tour 
excellent and well worth the visit 
then at check-in the reception staff was very ordinary and had no idea on how to assign rooms 
proximity to the airport is the biggest thing that the parkroyal saigon has going for 
activities consist of visits in other islands in the vicinity - everything is nature and in the most beautiful 
the room was a good size and comfortable 
pool area a bit small 
the chef trained and worked at the mandarin oriental as did the head waiter and one can see 
try the higher floors- for the view 
the hotel is also a residence 
this is located almost adjacent to the grand hyatt but offers a good lower cost alternative 
bathroom was great 
make sure you get one with good wifi signal and have a hot shower available in am 
do not confuse this ibis with one that is outside the airport a few miles and requires a bus 
we got a personal email welcoming us to the property and the concierge responded to an email question 
a bus tour we booked one day left from just in front of the karstadt dept 
efficient and well schooled in making the traveller or guest feel welcome 
to give the ibis credit , they did n't make a fuss when we told them we were 
in fact taking the s8 is likely faster than a taxi ( and costs about 60 less ) 
the walk down to the beach is easy 10mins and the beach is so nice 
efficient but very loud airconditioning along with a very hard bed - two king singles with king single 
had a very pleasant room overlooking the river 
great location good hotel 
the sofitel across the street ( next to the train station ) looks very nice 
if you are looking for even a bit of life ( late dinner and drinks ) then best to avoid 
but it seems an entirely appropriate setting in this lush 
very good excellent well appointed bedrooms , slightly small bathrooms , large modern comfortable hotel . 
but there was a major mess up by the concierge prior to our arrival 
the fasano is a charming boutique hotel 
room amenities include coffee maker and laptop-size safe 
the bathroom in our room was poorly done with only one sink and the shower fixtures leaked 
large lobby with bar 
stunning hotel in s o paulo fasano hotel has a lot of class and style 
if the housekeeper was n't able to clean the room properly 
this hotel is fabulous 
great shower 
the bed was fairly hard 
breakfasts were good as was room service 
it had a hand held with very little water pressure and even though they tried to fix it 
this is an excellent hotel which is only a five minute walk from the city centre 
however it was all very clean and the bed was comfortable 
they helped me sort out a problem with a prebooked tour including calling tour agencies 
but there 's enough space on the side and back to park a vehicle 
the front desk staff were really nice as well 
of an evening there was a live band in the bar which had a great chill out area upstairs and 
aswel as a good sized pool 
it had a seperate bedroom 
stayed here 1 night in a deluxe suite 
the hotel was a bit outdated though but still the location was perfect for us 
the only downside was that noise from above was a little intrusive 
try the table number one 
and i prefer some privacy when occupying the toilet ( it 's not an issue if you 're 
this property is very well managed and is a credit to taj group 
lovely temperature ( great for cooling off as the ave temp last week there was around 39- 
well run large resort 
a long journey from the airport but worth it 
the hotel is ina prime location -- run by the taj 
check was delayed as they had a limited front desk staff on duty and i was then assisted by a 
this is a small boutique hotel in milan 
it is a basic business hotel 
i liked the hotel and the quiet area 
excellent rooms at good prices with great views of duomo 
free wifi and comprehensive breakfast included 
- the checkin checkout was swift and the front receptionist was very helpful 
the rooms are very small 
but it was light colored shag carpet after all 
they charge a premium tariff and you expect first class 
so that is in a great area if you want to be right in the middle of it all 
is the same bar that the old hotel washington had 
big bean-bag type loungers that you can move to where ever you want in the resort 
the resort is a haven for families 
also i guess if you are there for a weekend you might want to get a higher floor room as 
) who was a greeter at the main entrance 
a free shuttle bus is available within a certain distance 
the long way we took alongside the road was horrendous & was actually very dangerous given we were walking with 
went to explore little bit on foot which was pleasant and most central attractions reachable within a mid distance 
bar is worth going - an amazing view of the monument and the white house 
centrally located in hochiminh city hotel eden saigon is very well located 
the gym is absolutely tiny and the pool is not much bigger but the view from both over the city 
wifi is super fast 
easy to find and in a good area 
very spacious with 2 beds and huge lcd 
the hotel has one of those charming old cage elevators which nowadays operates just like any other modern lift 
room comfortable bathroom unique a must stay . 
the rooms are spacious and very comfortable 
albeit a little restricted view of the sea from our small balcony 
the location is close to central station and the city centre 
from the time i checked in to the time i left we were impressed with the hotel and the staff 
the sitting area was fantastic 
beds and linens are good quality and the rooms very quiet 
a fabulous area to cool down after a day exploring 
a great place to lounge next to the river 
the size of the rooms is good however they are a little tired and the service was generally good 
but the highlight was surely the warm hospitality from all the staff 
choose the river front rooms for a bit quiter ( sounds of boats and live music inhouse 
perfectly situated near the grand palace on the banks of the river 
an excellent dinner 
the 'room' was very generously sized with separate living and bedroom areas - both with large windows and 
rooms were small with limited amenities 
nice views and plenty of space with nice fresh coffee but breakfast is a cheap affair 
the bar is nicely laid out and enjoyable 
this was a good hotel 
the bathrooms are very spacious and nice as well 
the bartender in the bar downstairs does an excellent cocktail 
all of the other 500-600 night luxury hotels in the city on a late summer weekend 
breakfast buffet was average with indifferent service 
with a separate area for luggages 
great to have a separate lounge area 
the room was n't ready when we arrived 
when i brought this to the attention of the front desk 
made for an enjoyable stay 
our suite was perfect 
you have definitely recruited a great team and a 5 star employee in michelle 
one example is a dimmer switch in the bathroom that you can turn to the right level to find 
the room and the bathroom were clean and serviced twice a day 
though no bath we had a fantastic walk in shower and both the hand held and power showers were easy 
gym and location i would think about staying here again ( an the shower pressure was great although not 
given that there is no cell phone reception there , having a wireless internet connection was greatly appreciated . 
with excellent beds and new larger flat screen tvs 
good air conditioning and windows which open 
i say hot but actually it was stone cold which was frankly disgusting 
we probably would n't stay here again but we are still glad that we did and will remember it 
large lobby and breakfast was tasty & plentiful but room was shabby - old decor 
near nana bts stationthe hotel is in a convenient location near nana bts station 
the light above the bed is a lethal danger and i have a scar to prove it , i 
the bathrooms were extremely small and the room was sparsely decorated 
this does however do n't expect all the frills of modern day hotels 
we could hear a neighbour coughing but the main noise problem was some noisy families walking down the corridor very 
may be the staff cant make me feel warming 
free soft drink bar 
you can also use the internet for free there 
the cabins are smartly decorated in period style and the old fixtures are fantastic 
do n't stay at a heritage site property unless you are prepared for some of the heritage to be 
very long flight only to get out from the car and found that we had to lug our heavy bags 
since i had a train to catch next day to london 
desk and your own imac which allows you to watch tv 
the service has been excellent and our room is great located close to the pool and overlooking ( just ) 
i do n't think i 've ever provided an excellent rating on a hotel that has prices at 
this resort is newly renovated and have a very luxurious feel 
bed seemed short as the room was narrow 
valet parking is expensive at 45 a day 
dinner in the restaurant served good food and my only comment is that perhaps they should dim the lights 
the staff are always friendly and the bar and restaurants offer good value for money 
facilities - impressive indoor & outdoor swimming pools 
one bus takes you directl y to bondi beach 
average , location not the best . 
there is a good restaurant in the hotel which may be helpful if you hosting people as it was the 
a superior room is on a higher floor with a better view 
thats the trouble with white walls in hotels 
saving some for our next visit 
quite a nice simple hotel and good for business stays 
a nice touch to have remembered our name 
all in all a good hotel 
very friendly bar staff 
good location 
the bathroom was fine and the shower was easy to use 
the pillows are terrible as they provide zero support 
there is a new reception team here since last visit but not as friendly as before 
families with morals and or children should avoid the strip unless you are driving in a car with the 
and for sydney - great value 
at 145 a night it was quite good value 
staff uber friendly 
you have several great restaurants and two great nightclubs 
positives- warm welcome and requests actioned ( high floor away from lifts ) - larger room than 
breakfast breakfast breakfast and you can walk to everything from here 
hotel is really pretty 
bed and linens were comfortable and blackout curtains worked great 
it was the first time stay for me at this hotel and i found this hotel fairly comfortable and value 
it has some great restaurants 
they let me stay in the old wing so the room was nice and had a lot of space and 
and had great skyline views of city 
free wifi available for guests 
and reasonably clean and the decor was not bad 
the bathroom was of a good size 
the clientele is a rather odd mix of businesspeople 
magic on the front desk was extremely efficient and kindly showed us to the lift 
it 's a lovely building 
this is a very nice new business hotel 
roomy bathrooms with separate shower and deep soaking tub 
the comfortable bed was great for combating jet lag later that evening 
a very enjoyable trip 
the service is impeccable and they waiters are not just good 
very nice bathroom amenities and a mini-bar 
the great staff at reception and valet as well as comfortable beds were highlights 
one of the best hotels in la but cannot compare with the four seasons in asia 
the hotel reception and concierge were very helpful and helped us make the most of our stay 
was in the building closest to epcot 
the concierge did all our bookings and suggested nice dining options 
the reception and concierge services were excellent 
staying with young adult son we enjoyed the quiet pool 
this is one of the true disney hotels where if you never saw a theme park you could be 
located right on the beach and marina as well 
-great rooms with very comfortable beds - we had a room with a balcony with a lovely view- 
buy some snacks so you dont have to go into the very expensive mini bar 
the rooms beautiful 
we got free wifi 
a splendid 5 star property with excellent staff 
the staff was beyond friendly 
a fairly adequately sized private swimming pool with a statue of lord ganesha at the opposite end 
i did have better massages in bali 
the whole property is very tranquil and quiet though it was high season ( we stayed over christmas ) 
upgraded to a one bedroom suite in the wilshire wing and the room was gorgeous 
first stayed here when i first moved to ca 
eating out and with the abundance of taxis in the area basically not too far from anywhere in bali 
keeping a checklist of whether a room has been cleaned or not is something a basic one star property can 
when lying in bed - with only one reading light to share between the two of us ) you were 
walk past the taxi stand and just head over to the sea walk for a brisk stroll or gentle ram 
we arrived at the hotel lobby with a big suitcase & a few small bags 
there is a big nice shallow pool which the beach villas share 
it is located by the beach so the sea breeze was a welcome relief after exploring blazing hot barcelona 
an added bonus is the main train station is almost right next door 
the bathroom has a tub for 2 and spacious shower and adjoining walk-in closet 
while i was having my poorly fried noodles 
i stay 4 nights in late april and early may with some other friends 
club rooms are actually good value 
great location on the beach and all the bars and restaurants close by 
they will promise to check and return your call 
for sure this is the best luxury hotel in barcelona 
this turned out to be a good value for money 
our last visit was during the bangkok army coup and we were the only few guests and the hotel 
comfortable beds and good internet 
respectful of gluten free travellers 
the views from the rooms are great but the rooms themselves 
sunny helped my wife with her luggage very polite & helpful 
but were not expecting such a nice facility 
in the lobby in front of the ballroom where guests were having cava and starters 
nice and large room 
bathrooms are huge with a wonderful tub 
our package included free transportation from the airport to the hotel although ( usually there 's a surcharge 
free internet is a plus 
the bar and restaurants area is magnificently designed and as the floors are all made of soft sand 
the area is fascinating as it 's very chinese with lots of small independent shops giving it lots 
upon entering the hotel ground floor one must take elevators up to the lobby level 
on arrival to the mainland wharf for nikoi 
with a separate bathroom ( combined bath shower ) 
exec lounge very good 
the concierge were friendly to help me getting taxi to where i need to be for the week 
i stayed for one night enroute to home after a week on the coral coast 
the biggest pro is the free strong signal wifi within the room 
lovely breakfast served by freindly staff 
the gym has only about one machine and to be honest they could do with finding a better position for 
but not a bad location 
the team at the front desk and the breakfast restaurant are extremely friendly and helpful 
the only cons for us were the relatively small pool 
the guy picking us up said 'your flight was delayed so we charged you more' oh right 
this hilton is a little old but is very conveniently located 5 min walk from old town square and 
right next to metro and tram stops 
the rooms were very clean albeit small and the shower was very good 
servers brought great appetizers 
poor sound-proofing - i was in the 17th floor but still could hear all the street 
freshly made waffles 
on a relatively quite street to allow for grat sleep 
the bathroom is spacious with a good powerful shower 
the beds are nice 
staff is the friendliest in ny and location is very convenient 
they have inward facing rooms available 
this hotel was very close to wenceslas square and major shopping and some good restaurants 
the lobby is quite small 
no complaintsthe staff were great too - everyone i dealt with was friendly and helpful 
and a variety of food and drinks available throughout the day 
nice hotel but internal noise 
i loved that they had a nice coffee maker with complimentary newman 's own coffees 
we went to the roof top bar one night and it 's covered 
but that 's a given in better new york hotels these days 
good service and very helpful staff 
great bathroom 
it is also a short walking distance from the old town which is great for visiting but also for bars 
for those who prefer luxurious accommodations and excellent cuisine over convenience and proximity to the ski slopes 
book valley view or lowest level view and upon check in ask if they have any upgraded views available 
airport directions and city facts 
breakfast overlooking the sea with the sun shining in was very special and dinner equally so 
staying in lovely hotels but we have never experienced quite the level of sophistication 
the bar and the breakfast room are just simply stunning 
n nthe only downside is the cost of the parking ( 25 overnight ) on top of the hotel 
the gardens are beautiful 
on a high floor for great views 
getting back at 7pm before a quick turnaround to go to dinner and the room wasn t done 
we were only staying one night for a show 
a special note must be made of the amazing toiletries provided including bulgari and penhaligon 
you get the marriott quality with a very efficient service and friendly staff 
would definitely return on my next trip to boston or cambridge 
the kind of hotel you like for a business trip 
very comfortable bed and pillows - the best of many hotels i have stayed in 
now that would be good customer service 
the subway red line runs under it 
the room was decent size great beach view and nice little touch like the butler leaving scented so 
so sunbathing by the pool is only possible for a couple of hours a day ( the structure 
the area is good for cambridge 
on the whole i would recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates a lovely hotel with excellent staff 
very close to the beach & cavill ave 
so i ca n't comment on the external buildings 
the menu is limited and unappetizing 
as a marriott rewards member paying a good price for the room 
the pool is also nice but very cold 
i had a large and comfortable room in this hotel - which has very good facilities ( nice restaurants and 
late checkout 
as i was here on business i wanted an early start and the breakfast restaurant was ready and going at 
breakfast buffet is a winner but for their guests who consider rice as staple in their diet 
the tv was so far from the bed i needed to go and buy another pair of spectacles and 
the pool was a little disappointing and the poolside service could have been better 
but you can tell its an older property 
the best hotel in chongqing 
a supermarket entrance is right by the escalator 
we were told a comprehensive list of drinks was available 
this is the best spg cat2 property i have ever stayed 
have to pay for classes at the big apple gym ( but otherwise free access to both gyms ) 
they 're all suites and there is no way you could n't love it 
my husband dislocated his shoulder diving in the hotel swimming pool and the staff at the hotel were extremely 
it was so lovely to stay there and i recommend every one to go and stay there 
great free and reliable wifi too 
i asked to use the pool early one morning and was told it was not possible 
the 150 plus years of this hotel have seen an amazing array of famous personalities visit in and the exhibition 
marble bathroom was clean with all amenities 
fuji and hakone area is nearby too 
the fierce aircon quickly cooled the room down - it was a very hot day outside 
staff was very robotic and their recommendations were cookie-cutter standard and as such next to useless 
the hotel reception is always busy 
the hotel is connected to the tokyu department store and right in the centre of shibuya 
a room at the back may be the best as the hotel is on a main traffic route into the 
might be back again to try and visit the zoo next time 
the bathroom was a good size 
the beds bit hard 
the bathroom is also spacy 
room size is very spacious and rooms were reasonably clean 
the property has a minimart downstairs and you can even call them to deliver items if you need 
amazing resort great for families and couples on the doorstep of phillip island 
lunch and dinner to all be of an excellent standard and the service was very attentive 
i found my loft room worth the extra price for the space and the view on a private garden at 
they told me they the first nobu restaurant in switzerland will open soon as well 
the hotel is the best in hanoi 
they provided a personal butler service who helped us for check in 
elegant comfortable room with comfortable king bed 
and that 's a sign of a good hotel 
pure luxury 
car parking convenient 
located just out of the main customs area and just across the road from the stadium 
for those who are mobility limited - you might find getting in to & out of the shower bath a 
nthe front desk staff we found to be helpful and friendly and gave us all of the information that 
bath twice the size of a normal meant a really nice long soak but that was after the other bonus 
afternoon tea and evening cocktails are nicely presented and the staff do a wonderful job taking care of all 
great pool and spa gym 
the pool was very well maintained with great pool chairs and staff 
the bathroom was also of a good size 
the 2 main restaurants are both very good 
separated by the shower cubicle 
there is a large bar area and a good sized restaurant and being one of the larger hiltons 
the main lobby is quite small & quickly fills up & becomes difficult to use 
staff friendly at check-in and throughout my stay 
luxury plus great location 
there 's air con so can avoid opening window and having road noise 
this was supposedly a superior king room 
the rooms whilst clean and the beds comfortable but having twin beds was horrible 
nice staff 
i rate it as one of the top hotels i have stayed at 
nice option close to bhx airport 
this is a large hotel geared up for large conferences events and the night i stayed the hotel was over 
we are frequent visitors at hilton executive lounges but our first to this one 
we dined in the dining room and the food and service were absolutely superb 
large common area 
they have free coffee in the lobby in the morning or in the room from a coffee maker provided 
the guy in the gym is a little annoying though - he just stands there and stares at you with 
the first room we were allocated stank of paint but we were able to transfer to another room 
the off bedroom also had a king sized bed and a balcony 
we came here to celebrate a birthday in a beautiful mountain area and had a wonderful weekend 
the hotel has a beautiful pool with restaurant and a garden restaurant next to it 
the lobby is awkward and had no good place to relax other than a small seating area next to the 
very nice hotel worthy of the westin name 
you get free internet 
do n't dismiss this hotel because you have n't heard of it 
good service and consistent sheraton quality 
and worth a visit 
the outside swimming pool cannot of course be used during the many cold months 
and accompany you to check-in and then to your room 
large bathrooms 
there is a convenient shuttle bus taking you into town every half hour 
the pools are huge and great with easy accessibility from all rooms 
and shuttle service to one of themreception - warm 
dirty tables 
heated swimming pool 
the spa is very nice nd we had treatments 
for travelers who 'd like to explore the old town and boutique shops in the day time 
needless to say that when staying at a four seasons you get all the luxury and excellent service that 
at least eight times what i believe is a reasonable price 
the location is excellent just on the edge of the old town and the promenade just across the 
the rooms overall were very comfortable 
the beds are super comfy 
and more than once we would get a call to the room saying our taxi had arrived 
great hotel good customer servicefriendly stafflovely placevery quietlooks like a hotel resort but it 
the royal nikko is definitely one of the best hotels in taipei 
i stayed at this hotel a few times and got always good and friendly service 
a beautiful palace 
but the hotel was nice and a good value considering prices in the city 
the room was not cleaned properly there were two black bobby pins - on on the floor and the 
lovely pool 
this is a beautiful property 
hotel is a great location for accessing the metro and there 's a number of restaurants bars near 
wonderful bar space and breakfast area 
shanghai station is about 10 mins walk and if you fancy a stroll to the bund it will 
and modern bathrooms with excellent facilities 
the food and service are wonderful 
a loft in a beautiful building 
the front desk staff were very helpful 
exterior is old style but inside is sleek . 
between 1975 and 1983 the home of the italian ambassador and inside had highly polished wooden floor and was 
the westin is in a good location 
they offered free internet access in the rooms 
the bed and amenities were wonderfuli used room services for dinner and lunch the second day 
the gym has good equipment but unfortunately face the road instead of the gulf 
you have a couple of good restaurants in the hotel 
the lanvin bathroom set was lovely 
with free parking and numerous good food options 
the breakfast room is bright and airy with a nice array of options including individual portion servings of fresh 
a huge desk replaced a second armchair so we had to take turns sitting down 
i t is undoubtedly the best luxury residence in hanoi 
new and well decorated 
there was a strange irony in that we walked around the very lovely gardens one afternoon - and at the 
they gave me the smallest rooms ever had 
even the bathrooms near the pool area are spectacular 
i would recommend the new opera wing if you are not on a budget 
nicer with the open space on the garden 
luxurious resort in fantastic city 
the bathroom is nice 
the beds are great 
if you do n't want a great little character hotel 
while the lady behind the front desk was helpful 
club lounge was excellent 
i have free coffee throughout the stay 
it is a pleasant property and offers a nice free breakfast buffet but customers should be aware of the steep 
the close neighborhood of the hotel is run down 
we especially liked the check-in directly in our room 
there is a decent strip of restaurants at the beach 
what an amazing property - from the welcome to the check- the service only gets better by the minute 
of course one can count on nice prices in 5-star resorts like this 
small desk and ours had a sofa as well 
a must visit even if you do n't stay 
i 'm still happy we stayed despite a few small disappointments 
it literally gave a new furniture smell the moment i walked into the room 
great stay and beautiful hotel 
the staffs was friendly 
gym was small for a sofitel , pool was really really short . 
this is one of the best 5-star hotels i have stayed in 
a patisserie frequent by both locals and tourists 
short walk to the parliament building 
but the welcome into a cool lobby and reception was fantastic 
we had dinner one night at the ferris oyster bar & grill ( upstairs ) 
the outside of the building needs scrubbing down 
we never even saw the front desk at all 
each floor is assigned 2 elevators but one must push both elevators buttons to get service on both 
we were in the new wing which was well appointed and the western food is good 
however it lacks any impression of luxury that one looks forward to in a hotel 
stayed in premiere club room in opera wing 6 the floorgreat job restoring this historic propertynice 
the room is no better in terms of the smell . 
the location is excellent and within two blocks of a mall complete with a food court and grocery store 
the gym is solid and the sauna clean and hot 
there was a small fridge and sink 
and the worst of all -- internet is free but not working well at all 
a comfortable bed and a large ( double sink ) bathroom 
and higher floor 
few minutes' walk to sightseeing the old towns 
and found the rooms beautiful and service close to perfect 
after staying one night at this metropole hotel 
ihg member privileges are cut to a bare minimum and the lowest and cheapest of any 
the hotel were really top service 
gorgeous wooden flooring which you come to appreciate if you are in hotels a lot and have 
this was my first trip to vietnam and selecting the metripole hotel in hanoi 
very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom with a separate bath tub 
our room was ready with everything we had asked during our first stay 
hence we were unfortunately not able to enjoy the amazing pool many other reviewers have written about 
the bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent 
i had to check out during lunch to go for a convention and head to the airport later in the 
bars and spa to be fabulous ( if pricier than most everywhere ) but there is a true amb 
many cold selections 
for a continental european hotel and the service fom the staff and concierge team is 
we had good recommendations for local restaurants from the concierge 
this airport hotel was a good start to our japan stay 
fast checkin & fast check out 
everything about it is pure luxury 
front desk did not always answer the phone 
things will change when then new four seasons opens on the lake and a little bit of high end competition 
nothing better than club level at a ritz you really do want a beach facing room . 
our room was quiet and the bed was comfortable 
from the time you get out of the car the staff treats you well and the check-in is 
you may visit the outlet next door for some shopping and the observation deck ( and sky museum ) 
great beach 
the room was excellent and the situation of the property is ideal 
at full price 
very good quality bathroom accessories 
but so did everyone else and the typical guest was not a typical ritz guest as a result of 
or lower cost hotels nearby where the facility amenities are similar 
the walk in wardrobe is also much appreciated and they could do better if they have a larger space for 
just right . 
as always the service is very good and so was the club area 
the hotel staff are extremely helpful and warm 
with a car park facility at a small charge - no complaints at all 
the club floor staff is very courteous and personal 
absolutely brilliant and excellent value for money 
no shuttle necessary 
the pool area fantastic and service everywhere is effortless 
pool attendant 
the greeting from door staff and reception was warm and friendly and check in efficient 
lifts fast and new 
had a lovely experience as we stayed on the 5th floor and the rooms were very modern with a 
the large double bed was very comfortable and the room decor was pleasant and relaxing 
new desk chair 
there is iced fruit water available all day 
the lounge is small 
one separate room with a table and a sofa ( convertible bed ) and a small kitchen 
the taj has a team of staff dedicated to making you feel special in very nice surrounds 
the pool is alright 
the staff were very friendly and helpful and the guest laundry also handy 
avoid the first room ( s ) after the lifts if you are a light sleeper as there is a 
convenient and value 
the staff very friendly and were only too pleased to help us with any queries or requests 
carpets in the lobby are dirty and needs a change or thorough cleaning 
both mahesh and himali at the lounge provided really friendly service 
free wifi was very good 
the room was comfortable and lacked nothing . 
the service staff was helpful and responsive to your needs 
take a suite pref 4 th or 5 th floor 
i had dinner in one of the restaurants which was very good and breakfast buffet was good 
we had hot water for a shower and they made us a lovely lunch 
its a little dated but the service makes up for it 
they do a lot of little things that improve your stay such as lighting a fire in your room if 
the food is basic and wholesome and may be not up to the standards of safari lodges 
poor value for money 
rising from reception the first floor rooms are accessed by a wide landing and we were fortunate to be given 
a new build on the estate it has good facilities 
the pool is a good size with jacuzzi 
lots of shops on the lower ground which can address older tastes and lots of events outside the hotel 
it is great to walk every where 
breakfast was very good although surprising that some items like omelettes or porridge was extra 
and fogged up easily ( it 's an old building ) 
we told the front desk when we went out the next morning and to their credit 
the kitchen is fully equipped with the living and balcony area ideal for hosting family and friends in front of 
food and service were both top notch 
we took a while to find it as we had to negotiate our way through what could best be described 
walking into the hotel is like stepping into american history or an old movie 
new plush towels 
no free weights 
all high ceilings 
we ask for a better room as what they offered to us was not as promised 
has a gym and there is no noise despite being an airport hotel 
chaotic is the best word from the front desk 
great bed and bedding and lovely toiletries 
the beach is also beautiful 
and the coffee was very good - often a failing in the best places 
the hotel is in a good location and the beautiful decor and sitting room on the top floor are a 
this is an excellent airport hotel adjacent to international terminal 
which are part of the leading small hotels of the world collection 
additionally water would flow out of the shower stall and there was no shower curtain at the bathtub 
we had a lovely large room with its own spa and excellent kitchen dining area 
pool spa and lounge were nice 
i would stay again 
the hotel bar and restaurant are very good with nice drinks and tasty food 
the restaurant offers a fair range of menu choices and whilst the price of dishes has increased in recent times 
large bathroom with separate tub 
their advice was to close all the curtains instead of checking the actual temp from the vent and carried out 
more improvements for front desk 
huge windows 
but i have been in several hotels in las vegas and this one offers convenience and comfort 
i was only informed at the front desk upon checking in that the hotel was being renovated ( it was 
a short walk from the international terminal 
rooms are cheap decorated 
this seems to contradict the idea of an airport hotel being a place that offers travellers a restful stay 
efficient check-in with plenty of friendly young staff including help to get bags to our room . 
did the job but no more well i wanted somewhere for a few hours bleep in transit and this 
our superior double bed room was very clean 
great for tired travellers location is the best , just outside the arrival of akl international terminal . 
additional free internet stations at reception offset the annoying free 30 minute wifi which expires as soon as you 
breakfast was an excellent buffet with lots of choice 
whirlpool ) and requested a high floor 
its definitely the best airport hotel in auckland 
separate shower and wc 
the 11am checkout is very generous as most nz hotels we stayed in had a 10am checkout 
the beds are comfy and the food was good 
no free wifi either 
hotel is brand new so very modern and good sized rooms 
the breakfast was excellent and the gym facilities are very good 
so check your bill 
bathroom amazing - seriously fantastic shower - no water limiter here and two shower heads 
room itself was spacious and clean 
just perfect for a mass tourism property like this one 
the decor is modern and the building is amazingly soundproof with no airport noise 
kayla and daniel at reception are greatrooms a bit small 
large but narrow shower ( no tub ) 
our taxi driver could n't even find it i had problems with my pillows being too soft ( 
great location and clean 
room was modern and comfortable with a view of the excellent large pool 
the views are not great--but mine had a good view of open spaces toward gurgaon ( 
super close to the airport 
but 80 litas from it and that is too much for a short trip 
must be something better for the price 
this hotel is located on a side street and the city center 
the best hotel in the city 
fast wifi connection 
better to have a room on one of the higher floors ( less noise from the busy street and better 
and i think rooms desire modernization - even to sleep there is comfortble 
nice toiletries 
i enjoyed the outside pool 
we strongly recommend the car service that is affiliated with the hotel -- we have used them several times 
totally impressed with the grand boutique hotel and the personal touches they provided during my short stay 
two people behind the desk but one not serving 
was in a good location for melbourne 
this was an afl footy deal and a great package rate that keeps me looking at ryd 
restaurant for breakfast was good with a generous array of food 
i had a small shower room with every amenity you could possibly think of and miller harris 
it is very close to some museums and there are plenty of restaurants in a walking distance 
clean and functional at a good price 
however this is facing the street so you could pick up quite few noise which made you difficult in 
we were upgraded to a superior room from a double on arrival which was a really good start 
the upgrade was not available at check in 
the hotel staff were very nice and professional and we had an enjoyable stay 
hot items 
tip is to sign up to pgr rewards for a free beer on check in 
i recently spent a short stay at the rydges melbourne 
every staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful 
the bar area is a marvel and should be classified as a national monument 
quality hotel with great access to central mall 
there 's also the duty-free floors that allow you quick tax-free shopping 
and led us immediately to our upgraded room ( starwood preferred ) with view of city hall square and 
this was my first visit to the westin chosun seoul and i would like to score 
the swimming pool and the saunas provide just about envy thing but the most avid sportsman could 
this was mostly forgotten because the rooms were great - spacious 
my workplace was located at the same building with the hotel 
great gym some of the staff excellent and the club lounge was very good 
restaurants are high quality 
our baby got sick and the concierge was very helpful in finding and booking us a visit at 
other than the main entrance with a big drive through 
central location and excellent service 
next time will stay at the hilton property next door 
service was great but service is great throughout seoul 
the westin chosun has very high standards of service throughout 
good service and nice hotel 
it 's fun and very relax to have a hot spring bath before dinner 
very nice luxury hotel in a very well location 
concierge is sincere , not obsequious and the breakfast is delicious but not over the 
stayed for one night ahead of an early start flight 
a huge queue and they insisted on each of our group of 21 signing their own room instead of me 
i used the gym each morning which was a treat as its exceptional since its the size of most fitness 
it 's a beautiful hotel - been around for awhile but well-maintained 
instead we took a very nice king size room 
it was good value for the hotel plus parking and very convenient being about 5 minutes walk from the terminal 
but rooms look tired 
the maid service is so good that you dont ever feel when or how they clean the room 
so if you just arrived in germany , jetlaged or in the early hours this 
so i decided to open the window for a fair amount of ventilation and to drop the ambient temperature ( 
the hotel hosts a number of good restaurants 
n ndespite being right on the airport 
and in equally convenient reach of the terminal 2 shuttles and the local trains 
i have been a bit spoiled by staying at some very nice hotels in asia and due to this 
the nearest mart was at the train station about 7mins walk away where can you find some food establishments 
so easy access 
the breakfast buffet is almost too large with full western and asian fares 
common areas well designed 
the rooms are clean and functional too 
stayed here for a short 2 night trip to seoul - this property is conveniently located in the 
albeit on the smaller size 
the food tastes nice 
the hotel itself is high on service 
and there would be no extra cost 
very convenient to airport 
keep up the good work ! 
as well as a decent sized bed and bathroom 
there is free wifi in the lobby but you have to pay for it in your room 
but it was otherwise priced at close to 300 euros 
he also surprised me with a nicely decorated fruit platter in my room which was done by him personally 
located mid-way on the pedestrian bridge between the airport and the railway station 
rooms are hip and modern but not cold 
45 minutes between appetisers and main course is unacceptable 
but if you go to the sports bar wifi is free 
but the staff treated you like you were a number 
only stayed here due to my flight being cancelled which gave me double misery 
the naumi is a good small boutique hotel nestled in the heart of central singapore in the 
the staffs were very friendly and the service was excellent 
it offers good facilities like sky pool & gym 
always nice to have a hotel right in the airport when one of the nefarious european unions decides 
rooms are spacious and beds comfortable 
and drinks if you have a club room 
small selection but nice buffet breakfast 
this is easily ranked in one of the top 3 worst hotels i 've been to 
the pool is fabulous for kids ( and grownups 
even without the poor exchange rate 
the rooms are fine but dull and uninspiring and instantly forgettable 
the only thing i like in the hotel is that the rooms are close to the beach 
you feel far far away from the busy streets of macau or hong kong 
an excellent resort with a value price 
we think the kempinski at baie lazare is an excellent beach resort hotel 
seeing how only one large table with approx 
the food in the beach bar is excellent for lunch with hot stone cooking being the signature i guess 
the fixtures and fittings in the room could do with some updating and if they did so it would 
but apart from small things like that , it is very pleasant . 
the staff and accommodation was first class - expect for one night where i seemed to have an ant inf 
the difference between a good and a great 5 star hotel is the service and the langham has 
soft pillows and all mod cons 
after 1030pm the traffic virtually dissapears so even if you are in a kent street 
considering there are 2 outstanding hotels flanking anantara 
the staff are extremely helpful and are trained to give staff a good experience 
elegant and charming 
outstanding experience only qualified by the fact that it was a short stay 
some nice city walks around that area too 
the interior is light and welcoming , indoor pool , spa and gym . 
the ambiance was relaxed with the guests seemingly being a mixture of business and leisure ( we stayed mid 
b ) sizes of the rooms are huge by any standard quality including amenities etc are all greatc ) 
check-in on the club floor was easy ( we had taken inter-connecting junior suites ) 
i recommend the raffles highly for the tired traveller wanting to be well looked after in the challenging physical 
the room i had on the street side of the hotel ( as opposed to the railway side ) was 
its location is great 
the beds were singles with mattresses that did not seem to fit the frame - i am quite tall 
huge beautiful room & bathroom 
the true testament to a hotels service is when things go wrong 
the think is we had a room on the 1st floor and it was really noisy if we open 
breakfast room is all glass on top floor 
it is close to the airport but not to the downtown area 
the airport is a 5 minute drive from the hotel and any taxi ride would only be aed 20 
it is all the little touches that add to its magic 
double sink 
rooms were spacious and clean 
tatu restaurant is top notch as well 
not black tea ) 
the area is perfectly safe to walk around during the day 
we got this room by booking in advance so at 139 a night- it was great value- crisp 
room cleanliness and decor is as expected for a mercure 
the bed was lovely 
there are plenty of other hotels better located in hanoi that offer much more 
we stayed here one night and had limited expectations 
the breakfast is like a cantine and not giving pleasant atmosphere 
it is a good solution for for comfort at a reasonable price 
got a room in the back so no problem at all with noise and location is excellent as actually there 
location is close to the old quarter and french quarter 
the service is still excellent 
for my first visit 
we have been to hanoi many times so this time around we have chosen to stay here since 
several nice restaurants 
best breakfast buffet in a long time 
they have a nice lounge so if you are a gold or a diamond hhonors member you will 
the famous quan ngon restaurant is nearby 
higher floor will have better view 
this is not the best hotel i 've ever stayed 
we used this hotel after a late night flight to jfk before moving onto manhatten 
the other issue was the outdoor lounge - they often played music late into the night 
the hotel is centrally located and there are plenty of good restaurants and bars in the area 
peaceful and relaxing hotel but we did stay in one of their very spacious suites 
checking in and checking out was easy 
anyway the hotel is not large but the rooms are spacious and the location is excellent 
as usual i felt like coming back home when entering the lobby and welcomed with a smile and a hearty 
lovely spa with great well kept facilities including steam and infrared sauna and hot and cold jac 
overall a good stay if you have corporate discount 
we also had issues with the bathroom - there 's a funky smell and the shower area shows its 
the room is abit small 
ask for high floor because of traffic noise 
keraton is definitely the best luxury hotel in jakarta that is located right in city centre 
it 's a basic level accommodation that serves a purpose if you need to be in the city for 
rooms on high floors should be quieter 
breakfast area are good with serving a nice lunch buffett as well 
very good location across from world square 
the major drawback is that the walls were paper thin - we could hear everything being said in the room 
clean and the staff are helpful and friendly 
great location with great service 
comfortable bed and pillows 
great location and good restaurants available at the hotel and nearby 
the lobby cafe is a good choice location to have a coffee 
subway train stations are located very near by and are accessible by underground walk ways 
hotel has direct shuttle bus to hanada airport in less than 1 hour 
excellent location in shinjuku area close to shinjuku station and nishi shinjuku 
modern with toiletries and amenities as expected 
the executive floors have been completely renovated ( ultra modern style ) and include complimentary in-room internet 
room 1018 was brilliant - very large and airy lounge with views over the boats and river 
lots of room and a kitchen with dishwasher and a full laundry 
the pool is small and short but usable and there is a japanese bath area in the change 
stopping on every single floor and people crammed in like a subway at rush hour 
we walked past the shops on the way to and from our room and the display attracted my wife every 
the same cafe offers dinner- again a buffet 
each night we drank in the elephant bar which is full of character and has a really nice feel about 
room size was adequate and clean 
ours overlooked the park and the concrete jungle of shinjuku 
the double beds were a bit narrow for two although we were glad that they accept a family of four 
it is no wonder why this hotel has so many excellent reviews 
you can take the hotel buss which drops you straight to the hilton 
it had a very nice vibe to it 
more business like but the rest of the city is in easy reach 
the shower was the best thought our stay in the far east and the bed the most comfortable 
i was always impressed by their hospitality and extra service 
the greatest of this hotel is the location & comfortable rooms 
the swimming pools for adults and children are of a good size 
the bathroom is a bit small but the shower opens to the room giving it a less clastroph 
as a seasoned traveller this is an oasis of calm and attentive 
had a nice view of the park nearby 
the front desk management is really great while the location of this hotel is of great value 
bathroom was equipped with a deep bath tub and and shower head at the same room 
never a wait for the elevators and they are fast 
the warmth settings certainly comfort one and personally i am happy to see the ceiling fan as it does not 
the day pass is great value 
it 's a busy hotel and heard about their legendary strawberry hi-tea however we did n 
a lovely bathroom too with a large roll top bath and a separate shower cubicle 
executive lounge also provides nice view of tokyo 
the pool was great and the breakfast was fine 
tea and coffee making facilities and a small but well stocked bathroom 
very good location for exploring phnom penh 
the shuttle service is available till 930pm in the night 
the food and snacks available in the executive lounge was nicely varied 
the high charges for extra services like in-room wifi ( offered free at the loby ) 
i maybe would have preferred to be in a slightly edgier areastaff were all impeccable 
too cold to dip in the lovely pool 
a typical business hotel 
we enjoyed the sushi bar and the steakhouse 
located more in the cbd area of shinjuku its about a 15min walk to the 
been to tokyo many times and this is the first time stay in this hilton 
the building is really ugly and the rooms are dated and average 
hotel has all the facilities you would expect for the price of a hilton 
after calling the front desk 
executive lounge is good 
there could be more food options as you really are limited to eating on the hotel grounds 
this is a very touristy area 
unfortunately due to renovations most of the restaurants were closed 
the big wardrobe can be useful and the wi-fi is free 
comfortable and very quiet with excellent views over the shinjuku area and the lounge was consistently very 
n nthe hotel is on the coast and it 's a short ( albeit steep uphill ) walk 
i was told one cannot book extra beds ( it in facts states you must when booking ) and when 
which is a nice touch 
so very nice to look at at the view ( even the bathroom had a small window that perfectly framed 
very good city centre hotel 
room facing the temple temple view room we had 2 rooms facing the temples with a verandah , 
the decor was good - not decorated yesterday but modern and clean 
breakfast was of good quality and reasonable variety 
the towels are paper thin 
the location of the hotel with its private entrance to the archeology park and the view of the temple 
the service is terrible 
excellent price 159 pounds for 2 nights with full english breakfast plus free child 's accommodation if bel 
shopping centre just a walking distance less than 15min from the hotel 
outdoor space ( the gardens are amazing ) 
the concierge provide us with excellent recommandation for restaurant 
it is a very good cafe brasserie next to the hotel 
it 's an older property and it shows 
and numerous restaurants 
the welcome from the front desk staff in the exclusive check in area was smooth and our two bedroom suite 
terminal 21 shopping mall and the train via an overhead walkway 
we ate dinner at 10pm one night which was rather late for us visiting from australia 
shower and toilet are separate and the shower even has a steam bath 
although it was a free service for starwood members 
the bathroom is large n' nice but equally the counter space had no room for my personal effects 
room was a great layout 
beds ( as per one of the primary reasons for staying in a hotel ) were super comfortable and 
trump came to the rescue . 
the only downside as a visitor driving in is that it is in a very busy part of town with 
great amenities in the rooms and very attentive at guest services - we got everything we asked for in quick 
sukumvit area is generally crowded and noisy 
in fact there are 9 separate buildings on top of the hill 
since phuket is pretty humid all round the yearrooms are decent sized and by the looks of 
small pool are 
amazing breakfast 
pretty good buffet 
bathroom is very big with an nice bath tub but water pressure was low 
they asked us if we still needed the extra bed which was strange as we booked this very specifically as 
the second area was a bedroom and large bathroom with a bath tub 
i have been staying twice at the hilton cyprus during the last month and i enjoyed my stays 
great outside pool weather permitting 
join the starwood program to stay on the best floors 
breakfast at rossini was great with quality food spread 
rooms are great & service is excellent 
this was one of my most impressive stays with a spg property in a long time 
absolutely beautiful apartments located in a great location 
the sheraton is a good solid hotel - would i stay there again on my next visit to b 
i questioned myself as there are hotels with better views of bangkok 
upgraded to 100m2 apartment which is all ope plan apart from the separate bathroom ( bath 
fabulous all round . 
the hotel also had a reasonable sized gym that had both cardio and free weights 
great coffee 
on friday night the bar is very happening and some noise music can be heard 
6th floor have the great suites 
location slightly away from the heart of santa monica 
food quality was good 
there is a small but very pleasant spa 
the concierge desk was helpful with restaurants and surf board rentals 
the la rinescante on the other side of the hotel has some good restaurants in the top 
broken toilet 
really knowledgeable front desk and concierge service 
thankfully i had read the reviews of this hotel and was not surprised when we were told at the 
management and staff of the hotel were friendly and helpful 
the location is very close to the temples by tuk tuk 
the amira is worth a stay and i will be back 
nicely decorated and kept very clean 
very nice buffet breakfast 
nice size bathroom 
my only small disappointment was that breakfast was very basic for a hotel of this class 
he gave us some great recommendations on dining and the city 's attractions 
which was beautifully done with largely international dishes and a few ( smoked halibut 
interactive big touch screen in foyer first class 
bed very comfortable 
beautiful new resort and great large rooms 
the rooms are large and they provide a large day bed where kids can sleep free of charge 
second or third floor overlooking the water is ideal 
swimming pool has many activity and the beach is breathtaking 
the alfonso is a superb and unique hotel 
the restaurant 's food was very good ( i had breakfast and dinner 
the hotel decorations and rooms are magical they capture the essence of that period with all of its royalty and 
and a nice room very near to the peace park which with trenches 
the buffet breakfast was excellent and susanna 
he finally stomped off with his family for the front desk since staff seemed not able to help him 
a typical corporate chain hotel with very efficient and courteous staff 
valet parking on site and friendly concierge are all part of the experience 
the staff were all very helpful and the location fairly good in terms of the station 
the tram is a 1 min walk away and that connects to all the areas you 're likely to 
lower quality preserves 
we received a warm welcome and were happy as rewards club members to get free water and discounts 
the hotel organised a pool side buffet dinner on one of the nights with a live band which was nice 
the breakfast buffet was excellent and dining room not too crowded even though the hotel was full 
the pools are great with one huge 40m new one which my daughter loved 
a long walk to and fro when my room key did not work 
but its location is great as its only 2 blocks from skytower and a 10min walk downtown 
clean and the bed was comfortable 
we had some great food in town too and would recommend 'moksha' 
stayed overnight for a visit to the southbank theatre 
the reception staff are friendly and helpful 
i could only hear slight noises when i was in the lobby 
the bathroom had good toiletries but the awkward shower was over the bath - i felt quite unsafe 
this meant you could n't open blinds in the morning and see what sort of day it was 
large rooms 
the corridors are long and it can be a long walk from the lift to the room 
the lobby is awful and very tight in space 
clean bedroom with crips sheets and nice bath roomit 's got in spades 
it 's right in the city so finding somewhere to eat 
and a great location one block off queens street 
great stay 
the hotel provided me with a long stay car parking pass which is apparently cheaper than paying daily at the 
it 's only a 10 minute walk to the waterfront and the sky tower is just around the corner 
the bed was fine and the bathroom adequate 
although arriving on an early flight from sydney 
the heating was adequate and the space was good enough for 2 persons with big luggages 
walk past reception then get in a second lift to get to room 
the bed was so comfortable - i want one for home and pillows amazing 
as i had a friend double parked outside the front entrance waiting for me - i had to leave the 
the only window looked down over a building site of a gutted shopping centre 
hotel is right in the middle of town 
the bathroom was small with shower only 
the novotel does come 2nd in terms of modern room styling 
but all the facilities that you can need from a city hotel and good and willing service 
the staff efficient and the cocktails were great although could have been filled to the top of the martini 
the room was nice enough with a huge window overlooking the city 
nice room had an issue with a twin room booked a double but kate from reservations sorted it out 
very nice visit 
the bathroom was nice 
the room was spectacularly clean 
the food is good and is close to the national museum 
the staff is friendly 
to the doormen were extremely helpful and friendly 
good toilettes 
the bar is a comfortable oasis for drinks or light meals 
although the food at the more formal seated dinner was surprisingly disappointing 
i was on a business floor where rooms are very nice 
but when we walked with her to help her to check in and then saw that room 
we had a room on the 24th floor with great views of the city and the river 
stayed in hilton osaka last year and service cannot compare at all 
airport shuttle prompt and efficient 
she was the only staff member during that period and made sure all guests were happy and served 
service efficient 
our office booked us into this hotel although our flight was n't due to take off till 5 pm 
the bed was very comfortable and made for a great night sleep 
indian food and bread was an unexpected highlight . 
a good 4 star review 
we loved our tented accommodation and the gardens and grounds are lovely 
rainshower and handheld shower ) are very powerful giving a good massage at the end of the day 
i was really amazed by the room size because it was in osaka . 
each space is also very comfortable for groups or a single like me 
the restaurants are good and the rooms are very nice and a good sizes as well 
the pool is open from early morning to late evening 
so we asked if there is an restaurant for a light lunch 
newly renovated pool area is wonderfully done with staff reading your every needs from your lips 
i 've stayed in my share of nice hotels but this one is right up there 
it was enough time to jump in the rooftop pool that had a lovely relaxed vibe and great view 
i would definitely return on my next trip to osaka 
i used to borrow one from the hotels including holiday inn sands and ritz carlton singapore 
it was too hot to walk 
nothing for the shy and understated client - already upon arrival you know that you are among the high 
it took them almost 1 hour to deliver food and when it reaches it 's not as it should 
sensuous interiors & fantastic staff 
however we booked through destinology in the uk as they could offer us a half board 
the fittings luxurious without descending to bling and the bathrooms well appointed 
superb roomy fitness center & grat outdoor pool 
for us the room had very little character and the service was rushed 
especially kate we found very helpfull and always asking if we were happy with our stay 
if you can negotiate the confusing marina square mall and the numerous other shopping complexes it is connected to 
it was also a short walk ( maybe 5-7 mins ) from the subway ( goes right to 
the club lounge had a good selection of snacks and for the evening offered champagne which was a nice bonus 
its really very nice property 
nice pool 
this hotel has a great vibe and a great lobby and a fun fantastic pool 
though we picked this place as a very short overnighter transit hotel - our flight came in late 
there are two pools - one larger and shallower 
our children loved the pool and the pool side food 
the door into the bathroom in room 420 has deep gouge marks in the tiles and as you open 
the property is attractively located on the beach 
you right on the beach although was a bit crowded 
had great sleeps- room size is fine what could be improved- breakfast is really nice ( too many 
only 20 minutes from the airport this is a good choice to relax if arriving late 
the atrium lobby area is spectacular and there is a refined elegance and attention to detail here which some 
the location is great 
i do n't think i have seen a hotel buffet breakfast offer three different types of salmon before 
the hotel is very beautiful 
5 minutes walk across the road is a massive shopping mall and next door to the skytrain that z 
the staff is helpful 
but we had the bad luck that always when we came there seemed to be a shortage of available tables 
they have established a good vibe 
the restaurants are excellent and the service is truly 5 star and the food is of a very high standard 
we stayed at the lindrum for 2 nights on a cold and windy weekend in melbourne 
rooms are nice the better value in the mid to high range than entry level 
all staff met were polite and welcoming 
we had lost our luggage coming from london and they upgraded us to a suite and then gave us 
this place does n't have valet parking which is a minor inconvenience but the comfy bed and 
clean and quiet - away from the noise of the main street in front of the hotel 
the breakfast was very good 
free internet is a major bonus ( and so unusual for australian hotels ) 
so a bit of a disappointment here . 
quality boutique hotel - the building restoration is sensitive and makes the most of those great high ceilings 
the mattress was comfortable and i slept well 
the free city loop tram is outside the front or 
the oriental has 1 ) beautiful communal areas 
but what really made the trip special was the staff and their care to detail 
we stayed there for two nights in a spacious two bedroom suit with excellent sleep conditions 
i am truly impressed by the willingness of the team to make your stay the best 
it 's about the japanese occupation of singapore and well worth a visit for history buffs 
mo singapore is possibly a very consistent way to try luxury mixed among tradition 
nice and equipped gym 
the pool area was great for an afternoon swim and much-needed shade was provided by the building to 
there were other perks like free pressing for 2 pieces of garment per day etc 
the room delightful and the access to shopping is great 
which made for a difficult stay 
french toast 
impeccably clean but there s no warmth in the staff 
this is a very nice hotel with talented staff who go the extra mile 
separate toilet and practically no noise from the street or the hotel hall 
the check in staff are decidedly average busy doing paperwork as you check in 
it also has a pretty cool pool very zen 
never a fault with this fine hotel providing superb accomodations and unobtrusive service 
the rooms some of the best i have stayed in and the club facility is one of the better ones 
order the hotel limo airport pickup - second time i have done this 
our room was modern 
it made the entire stay great 
the infinity pool at the okura boasts a nice city view 24 floors high 
the pool is very good 
---i chose okura based on many positive reviews on ta and for having seen it in construction phase 
as the hotel is only a short walk away from all of the major malls and the mtr stations 
an otherwise decent mattress on the bed that is ruined by a 10cm feather pillow top 
pool area is magnificent again with glorious views of the singapore skyline 
or little touches of 'omotenashi' but it was all very functional 
5 star and 5 star plus hotels at almost every corner and new exciting hotels opening on a regular basis 
we did notice that the goods are not cheap and the shops are pretty empty 
we dined at all 3 restaurants and the food was wonderful 
swimming pool is hanging over bkk on the 24th floor quite spectacular 
the infinity pool is nice although quite small 
getting taxis at the entrance was very easy and the bell boy being extremely helpful and efficient in doing so 
the rooms are spacious and comfortable 
it was great to have champagne breakfast in the lounge 
bright with a very comfortable bed and excellent bathroom 
the pool area and public areas are impressive and well kept 
pros-great location-clean room-modern furniture -quick and professional service -walking distance to 
the food is top-end and very expensive with bar drinks typically twice the price of other top- 
rooms are comfortable with all facilities you come to expect ( good bed 
but the rooms are getting tired 
you could do a lot worse and i found it good value for money 
we were lucky that we had done a lot of sightseeing when we first arrived in rio at 
got to get a ocean view room and high up 
and it was well worth the additional charge - the lounge is well laid out 
towels and amenities fantastic 
this is a good facility as you do need your wits about you ( but do n't believe 
they need to atleast give an complimentary internet 
the extra space of the suites really is a nice luxury 
taking into consideration the general level of hotels in dubai i would look for another newer establishment 
the hotel is quite close to the financial district 
the drop off and pick up area can be a scramble due to lack of space but the boys down 
honest housekeeping staff 
there are plenty of eateries and shopping malls close by 
the small bar was a very nice place to finish the day with a cocktail or glass of wine 
not enough electrical outlets 
needs focus on true service 
the breakfast buffet is among the very best i have had in india 
mid-level floors probably ok - friends told me upper floors they got bad cel phone reception 
the swimming pool is a plus but the spa and gym are super-both in terms of size 
get it hwile the price is good 
modern and located right on the beach with great views of doha from pretty much every room 
big thanks to the the room attendants ( they do n't go unforgotten ) again we chatted 
i thought and it was not pleasant dinner music 
stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during a recent business trip 
the hotel is a bit further away from the terminals from other hotels but still close enough 
also room service was prompt and was available around the clock 
my only main issue with the hotel was that i ordered room service twice at an ungodly hour 
only a 5 minutes drive from the airport and with excellent air conditioning it was a good choice and much 
overall an adequate choice if you need to be near the airport but there are better options elsewhere 
good quality airport hotel ! 
i walked for a few minutes either side of the hotel but it 's very isolated and there were 
the breakfast buffet was extensive to suit all tastes 
water pressure good and water temperature constant 
serviceable airport hotel with good breakfast buffet 
getting a free room upgrade is like winning a lottery 
shuttle bus right there when we came out of the terminal 
) offered several options for dinner 
the bathrooms are well-designed and the decor is attractive 
there are some small restaurants and liquor stores across the street from the hotel 
but with a bonus there are some shops right by 
a centrally located boutique hotel with immensely friendly and efficient staff 
the front desk staff checked the booking companies and even called two of them to see what they had in 
there are some restaurants and fast food outlets nearby but too tired to venture out 
what 's funny to me is that many of the reviews give the hotel high ratings and then talk 
good value good location 
however the hotel room i had was very tired with a tiny bathroom and air vents that needed a 
good value for money 
the room is big compared to other hotels and include all the amenities you need 
bar was well set out with a mixture of bar seating and larger seats grouped together 
live dj and the bar that spills over in the lobby makes it lively and welcomingwalking distance from old 
you can walk to gamla stan as it is just across the hotel so location wise 
the hotel staff is very friendly 
the rooms on the spg premiere floor were large but the showers were not great and need better doors 
but the walls are paper thin 
booked a room on a higher floor for better views 
in the morning breakfast was also good but whoever is in charge of plugging in the heating trays 
the sauna and gym facilities are useful to work off the extrra calories engendered by the 
we stayed one night at the boulevard hotel in an executive deluxe suite 
you have 30 minutes for free internet use with you notebook 
just a short walk 
very close to a train station which is one stop away from the main commuting center of kl ( 
we had no idea they were staying in the same hotel as us 
being connected to one of the biggest malls in asia is pretty cool and gives you lots of shopping 
the room service on the tv was a bit tedious and food was n't spectacular , however , and 
rooms facing the streets are very noisy 
great value for money serviced apartments at a great location 
all the staffs were very helpful during our stay 
only thing which irritated me is the blast of music from the new mall across the road 
s busiest the other lower priced hotels we tried had no rooms available 
separate shower lub and water closet ( toilet room ) - two tvs in the room 
grand spectacular lobby 
but there are many other properties on the strip ( and ones better still a very short cab ride off 
i called and spoke to a second manager who told us the room for first night would be comped 
we would definitely stay here again 
had to go to the front desk three times to get them to fix my room keys which was a 
the views toward train station ( these include the beautiful city hall ) and back toward shopping district are still 
was upgraded to vip service and special amenities 
sushisamba for the most amazing sushi experience ( treat yourself to one of their pisco s 
the bar in the basement offers good drinks and service as well 
space between rail & drawers not big enough to hang a shirt let alone a pair of trousers 
it has a good casino 
the complex itself has so many shops and restaurants you could spend a week there alone 
but for the overcrowded pool areas on the saturday of our stay 
new clean modern bathrooms and rooms 
it had a sunken lounge area with a large corner suite that can pull out into a double bed 
turn down service needs to be requested and even then it does n't happen - another first - i 
a mini bar and safe are provided 
had to ask for themno complimentary water bottles 
the staff are extraordinary and the accommodations are clean and cozy 
the standard of the decor i would describe as tatty 
we stayed there for one night we were a family of ten and ended up on two different floors in 
stayed in queens suite and it 's amazingly designed with excellent interiors 
they have alloted some areas where you can relax and enjoy your evenings 
enchanting and engaging as always . 
efficient service 
the pillows were very soft and even with replacement we were not comfortable 
there are numerous restaurants on the property 
nice pool and delicious food 
fast room service 
it is quiet hotel ( no noise ) with lot of greenary 
a fabulous property and great hospitality 
the cornflakes were of inferior quality 
the staff was very helpful 
i regret having to write such a bad review on this hotel but if you are looking for a good 
the club lounge was enjoyable and the food supplied was good with a large variety 
a memorable stay 
or a great resort for children 
beach good and spa very good 
guest services was helpful when having laundry sent out and returned 
when they claimed that i had emptied out my mini bar to the extent of 521 dollars 
the lights system in the room was poor in that the nightstand lights could not be made to work 
the restaurants are very good 
the resort is huge so you have to walk long distances in the warm climate to arrive at reception ( 
suites are spacious and well-equipped ( with the only drawbacks being that there is no coffee maker 
we were up-graded to a huge suite for our inconvenience 
the massage itself was very nice and the room and shower etc excellent 
bit dated property but gorgeous for sure 
husband enjoyed the golf course and the driving range which had discounts because of our racv membership 
stayed here for a couple of nights while attending a conference onsite 
we will definitely be returning very soon and ca n't recommend the resort highly enough 
a great conference venue 
the resort is n't within walking distance of anything so i would recommend you have a car if you 
this resort is not located in the centre of the gc action and public transport options are limited 
the best restaurant facilities and the best resort facilities on the gold coast 
the hotel room was very clean being 
for a short getaway 
extra chairs 
this resort is absolutely gorgeous 
the resort itself is so big that you can actually get lost in it as you wonder through the maze 
a scenic infinity pool makes is perfect to gang out 
they even recognize every guests and care greatly about their guests and especially want to thank for that 
and set amongst the gardens so you can dine under the stars 
this is one of the beautiful resorts in chiang mai 
on a beautiful island where there are piles of used water bottles in villages 
during my only free time poolside -- i could only have wished that they had service to cater you 
great breakfast area 
from the last review 
there were no bedside tables and one side of the bed was only accessible from the bottom of the 
there was a mist room and jacuzzi which were nice after a cold day out sightseeing 
great lobby 
super comfy beds 
the hotel tried their best to provide a comfortable and safe atmosphere 
so if you look for a great hotel somewhat close to the airport ( 40 minutes ) and do n 
the room was old but relatively clean 
a beautiful property offering guests a view of the bosphorus or the city 
the breakfast buffet was very good and the staff is very polite and friendly 
mrs cam on reception was lovely and made sure we were on the other side of the hotel on 
we had a great bath tub also 
the street side would be noisy if you were considering booking one of those rooms 
but the super market across the street is interesting to walk thru 
good place to stay on the way to cambodia river views are well worth it our stay 
it 's right on a great part of the beach ( other resorts have some beach erosion ) and 
the rooms are also larger in general compared to the w times square so between the 2 i prefer this 
the location is efficient for midtown meetings 
overall a great holiday and a perfect choice for a first visit to hoi an 
comfortable and offer all the amenities you could want 
the rooms were small and nothing to write home about 
very big and nice gym 
location is a huge plus . 
the great amenities 
modern and well laid out with large windows that give nice views 
very convenient hotel 
the bathroom was compact but very functional and the service i received from all staff on site was excellent 
and a good sized fridge minibar 
decided to stay at the chelsea because it was close to where i needed to be and 
the building is a bit dated but the downtown location is excellent 
book the room in one of the club floors- you will get complementary access to the club lounge with 
the room was pretty standard but comfortable 
great stay at grand hyatt ! 
3 and a half star hotels usually have this 
the beds were super-comfy and the rooms very peaceful 
nice balcony 
it 's lobby is very busy with line ups of mostly vacationers with lots of kids waiting to 
no matter which fkoor you are on you firt go to the top fkoor or 
service is top notch and all hotel people trying to go out of their way to help 
prime location next to klcc ( good for a morning jog in the park ) and excellent facilities 
if i base my judgement on a quality if a hotel it is about the comfort of a room primary 
with nice open bathroom 
checkin lounge is at the topmost ( 39 ) floor 
spacious and have all required mod cons ( save for coffee perhaps ) and service is top notch 
when i was about to leave the hotel for dinner one of the bellmen offered me an umbrella 
the bathroom was spacious 
bathroom with a big soaking tub and double vanities 
and fresh squeezed orange juice ( upon request to waiter ) were good 
fresh orange juice 
breakfast was too expensive but there are quite a few restaurants and cafes nearby for more affordable options 
even with an extra bed in one of our room 
ok airport hotel 
good hotel - staff helpful - bus crowded 
excellent - strange lifts though 
and t shirt for use at the gym only 
i personally like the rain shower in the bathroom and took longer bathing time than usual 
it was a good hotel to stay at before an early morning flight 
no orange juice so i went straight to the main dishes 
the suites are quite comfortable 
restaurants include a nice bar with friendly bartenders ( peter & kim ) 
wide range of dining options both in the hotel and in the precinct 
the hotel offers a free bus to from the airport and the hotel 
nice stay 
this is very good property 
complimentary mineral water 
the executive lounge does require more food in the afternoon and evening , as the supply did run out 
nice room the bed was really comfortable but hot shower did n't work 
3rd visit as good as ever 
but the size of the property and the walking and the keying makes the general logistics a bit daunting 
generally speaking the plaza location is very good 
this is probably a benefit avoiding the outside noise in kuta area 
i explained stayed at mercure next door several times and never had the issue 
in the centre of kuta beach streets give you great access to any place along kuta beach 
this booking gives you access to the lounge which is open till 10 pm 
the club lounge happy hour snacks are extremely limited but service was good 
the breakfast bar was excellent 
the cocktails at the hotel rooftop pool and bar were expensive and not that nice compared to other places 
nice spacious rooms 
breakfast buffet was plentiful and inhouse restaurant and cafe offered great choice 
from the coffee shop to the quotidien restaurant ( see separate review ) but most of all the 
hhonors show 2 reservations on same nights and i anticipate this being a problem 
overall not a good value 
great staff and superb location 
i found the service to be average and the breakfasts are about the same 
i was so excited to have this little luxury 
and the single bed that i slept on in the family apartment was sloped 
sat down for my welcome drink for 15 minutes and was totally ignored 
jinling offers a bit more for around the same price but this cp is still quiet good 
the breakfast is ok 
basic but not bad value for money 
there is thick carpet 
beds comfortable and temperatures good range on control 
check in was very easy in the beautiful lobby 
the bathroom large and the free wifi was at a killer speed 
room was reasonable size 
the lounge is good and the breakfast is good too 
but had some good selections 
so curtains open meant looking directly at people in the gym 
and the pullman thamin is right across the street from two shopping malls so you can just reach 
friendly happy very comfortable business hotel 
a great spread of western 
very nice rooms with all amenities one can think of 
the lounge was lovely and a good selection of food and very attentive host 
front desk however was frequently busy whenever i pass by 
our room was extra large and so was the bathroom which had not only a bath but also a separate 
the was a kettle for making tea and coffee but only enough tea bags for one cup per person per 
the tapas bar serves good food and drink which is excellent value 
it did have a fantastic bathroom 
valet parking was very accommodating ( considering i was on motorbike ) and very secure 
i liked the fact that the bathroom had both a shower and a bath . 
the building is a bit dated and the rooms are large and comfortable 
great facilities 
the citylodge at or tambo is very good value for money 
would love to give compliment to mr reza from the banquet for his extraordinary customer service 
rooms are standard and bathrooms new as hotel only recently built 
friendly staff and basic food and drink at reasonable prices 
trendy decoration and modern facilities in guest rooms 
taking a cab is your best bet 
so i assumed everything is top notch 
an up and coming group of luxury hotels located in china and taiwan 
interior is like a little beach-town crossed with main street with waterfalls 
previously stayed at the landis ( part of the same group ) but the services and facilities are 
good value and great service ( minus breakfast ) 
its very conveniently located near to the train station and walking distance of most of the town 's attractions 
which is massive in size and scope 
the front desk resolved this easily albeit with a small fee of inr 500 
its a good well maintained hotel with excellent friendly staff 
but if you do n't want to rough it in the old town then this is a chain alternative 
an extra bed was brought in 
bathroom a good size and shower good 
the in room service was super and the food was great 
has some good restaurants 
the bathroom fascilities were excellent 
the hotel lobby an elegant 
it has the perfect view of the pagoda and the room was clean 
our room was just okay but their breakfast was amazing 
we spent our last 2 nights in myanmar here 
the view over the city is quite good 
whilst passing through yangon we popped in for a quick lunch in the lobby lounge 
due to flight cancellation 
centrally located downtown if that is where you need to be 
food in the restaurants was delicious and service was great 
the beds were super comfortable and the service was excellent both times 
this hotel will more than meet your expectations for great quality and great service in se asia 
higher floor facing the main road 
water from the shower is plentiful and the water pressure is good 
a new luxury hotel located nearby is opening soon 
the hotel staff were great when we returned and organised a late checkout ( 3 
being the tallest building in sapporo 
the room was on the top floor & had a fantastic view of shwedagon pagoda 
at jr tower it seems all employees at the check-in desk and even waitstaff in restaurants 
ask for the high floor room 
if you stay here - i would skip visiting the roof top bar as you get the same view for 
yangon is a crazy busy city and the traders is an oasis 
and the happy hour snacks are sufficient to do you for dinner if you feel like it 
it is one of the best spa and offers only the 40degree onsen but they also have 37 
and although the hotel provided portable aircon units we had to run most of the day with doors and 
the breakfast buffet is very extensive and of high quality 
the room also had a fridge 
clean and functional business hotel 
and still smells new 
the sticker however is very sticky so you are well advised to request being spared the useless piece of sticky 
the decor and general cleanliness was poor 
n nfree parking that close to york city centre was the winning feature 
high floors are more quiet 
location good - connection to airport thank to direct bus great 
as we were on a 'horizon club' floor we were able to have breakfast in either the 
when i tried to adjust it to the least warm temperature 
they have everything you need - plus the bed is really comfortable with a great duvet - but they 
the wifi line is good everywhere in the structure 
so it is a bit noisy and smells like paint 
the staff helpful 
we stayed at the intercon coex during a conference last september 2015 
i read positive reviews of this hotel 
we were given the higher floor 
very helpful concierge 
large bathroom with separate shower and tub 
the subway is cheap and easy to use and has air conditioning which is important in the heat of j 
i enjoyed the club amenities and there was a good food and drink selection for the cocktail hour 
the club lounge is fantastic - drinks canapes in the evening are plentiful and the food selection changes each 
in the evening there was a good selection of alcohol available and other hot and cold snacks 
good business hotel 
the exec lounge was high standard as expected and a very good buffet breakfast 
if you are a light sleeper and depending on where your room faces 
all of the employees were so friendly and more than willing to go out of their way for any request 
the facilities were spacious and well kept 
the location of the hotel was quite good - opposite the hotel there was a beautiful temple worth visiting and 
the rooms were spacious and well furnished equipped with everything you could wish for 
good buffet and great service 
gave us a map and directions to the main sights 
the dual shower ( good pressure ) and the large and elongated bathtub were much appreciated 
i will definitely stay at this hotel again during my next visit 
the bed is very comfy 
simply superb service - 11 10 
tidy with all bedding and towels etc clean 
a grass-like green carpet 
lovely big bathroom with seperate bath and rain head shower 
chairs and a large flat screen tv 
just across from caesars palace and shopping also with a 24 hour starbucks and 10 other restaurants 
this was a fantastic hotel experience 
my advice would be to stay central and if this hotel offers bargain rooms off peak then maybe consider if 
finding the self park was a little tricky as its not well signposted from las vegas blvd 
but the price you pay reflects convention hotel standards 
the only noise i experienced in the room was on the saturday night but this is ca n't 
lobby lounge good place to dobusiness 
were in need of more attention - this is indicative of the small niggles ) 
near the property 
the breakfast buffet had a good selection of breads 
district3 is right above or adjacent to the parking garage 
the amazing lounge chairs 
we had no idea that this was also a boarding kennel for dogs ! 
from the infinity swimming pools you also overlook the nile 
the hotel gym is adequate but falls far short of many other hotels and the pool is a bit of 
we only managed to stay one night here but wished we had more time as the resort is beautiful and 
the rooms are well appointed with a very comfortable bed and good size bathroom with a great shower 
the hotel is situated right on the nile & the shisha lounge is a great place to relax 
beat some 5-star i have been to ( for gold and higher ) - rooms- staff- 
but this was made worse by the fact that we were given 3 single beds- which made things even 
very average bed and pillows furnishings etc 
we were very appreciative of the fact that the front desk staff checked us into the room straightaway 
nice helpful staff 
stayed at the premium level due to my platinum status and the room is spacious and clean compared to 
the lobby is a bit dated but all in all this hotel is good value 
the tram is free to ride through the city section 
walkable to imperial palace 
they should have the same beds worldwide 
it 's close to a great selection of bars and restaurants and the tram to the beach at gl 
pretty spacious rooms 
from the moment they valet parked our car to the next morning after breakfast in the club lounge 
bathrooms have a bath and separate shower cubicle with rain shower 
tokyo train station is also within walking distance and you can catch the bullet train from there 
not only is there world class shopping nearby but the area abounds with great restaurants and small intimate dining 
on check in we had a sign a waiver for the pets and the policy stated only one pet per 
great amenities and rooms 
lots of asian restaurants nearby and the area really caters well for those groups 
and the last day when we parked at the side entrance ( no one was around to give instructions nor 
the only issue which face is moving out in during evening hours when there is big traffic rush around 
and amenities like media console for the television 
the room was nice and comfortable 
higher floor square view 
i was impressed by the lobby and the minimalistic design 
helpful doormen 
the hyatt have delivered again with another outstanding hotel 
the best thing is taxi availability 
which the maids kept re-opening along with the outside window to let some fresh air in 
plenty of dining options right outside the hotel to avoid the usual ripoff breakfast charges 
check out was a breeze and i want to make special mention of elvis who was our minder 
the room service is good but not fantastic 
i was greeted & taken to reception where formalities was quickly done & was escorted to room 
restaurants etc nearby 
take a low floor to minimise lift jam 
the hotel staff is friendly and helpful 
housekeeping did not clean room on day 2 
they may need to have additional staff to help out 
the lobby is big and welcoming 
it use to be free in the lobby and that was always packed with people 
my room was literally next to the train line and bus route 
we took a bus straight from the airport to the hotel ( au 20 
moved to a better room 
the bed was very comfortable with fresh 
we were upgraded to a one bed room ( part of our booking ) and had plenty of space as 
stayed here due to conference next door at convention centre - a quick 5 minute walk 
spacious and beds are very comfortable 
on busy grey street on brisbane 's southbank 
it 's right behind glocerster road tube metro underground station and there are plenty of restaurants 
i 'm not writing a lengthy review this time 
so we were forced to open the window to get some fresh air 
cold and a buffet style in the weekend with the usual undercooked bacon etc 
the bedroom had a balcony ( roughly 3m wide x 2m deep ) and the bed was more 
a large and airy suite with daylight and windows that opened 
it full of basic amenities 
while the location is decent 
i mean i understand that hotels never close but if you are going to have people working out the front 
towels very though 
at this price you can stay in a 5 in the middle of everything 
brand new hotel with best facilities started at right location connecting gurgoan and manesar 
one of the best property in gurgaon 
the refurbishment is amazing 
i think they could improve the signals indicating restaurants and making sure we know they have several options for dinner 
you can easily take a taxi and they are cheap 
separate reception 
the modern design and resort-living furnishings work perfectly well to provide a very comfortable stay 
kids could build sand castles ( bring your own toys ) and hawker food to satisfy your hunger p 
it was great i received welcome cookies 
avoid the main hotel area as it 's a disaster and very much buttons style 
horror of horrors was trails of ants all over the floor of the bathroom and the bedroom 
beach and restaurants were amazing 
we had a memorable meal in both fusion and maya with the food being outstanding in both these restaurants 
just as well because the drink was very expensive at 6 for a bottle of water and over 10 for 
i understand it 's just been refurbished and the spa is due to open in the next few 
very good lighting in rooms and bathrooms 
it really provides excellent value for money 
my wife said this hotel is hip and posh but does it have style and class is a question 
the re furbished brasserie is a tremendous addition to the hotel and they are about to start 
the beach is very nice indeed but maybe the beach at medinat is a little more exclusive 
we have stayed in this resort for three days and we had an excellent stay . 
the bathroom was good 
and once the renovations are complete it will be a stunning venue for a break away from singapore 
but at full price it could easily make you think you had overpaid 
service , design , food were all a perfect 10 and you must meet carlos , the chief 
the breakfast buffet is very nice and big and they even have a fishpond where you can put 
the rooms have been very nicely fitted out 
and strong wifi signal 
the fabulous swimming pool and the resident peacocks roaming the grounds 
all of the public areas were beautifully decorated 
a very plush large bathroom with a big walk in shower was fantastic 
the resort is located on a huge block of land surrounded by lush greenery and water features 
but the welcome drink and towel only one 
the bathroom had a separate shower and tub with 2 basins and large 
great gym 
amazing - a perfect stay 
way above check in time but still have to wait for 25 minutes to get our room prepared 
the bathrooms are not cleaned daily and the hotel generally could do with a good clean 
bed and linens delicate and fresh 
the restaurants and the pool amenities are excellent 
the private beach is beautiful and well-served - it gets crowded but you can find more space at 
the beds were super comfortable and the room amenities very good 
its seclusion from cruise ships and the city are great but that will cost you in cab fare over 
to begin with the airport shuttle drops you and picks you up at the doorstep 
hotel location was central enough to take taxis or public transport and the lobby breakfast selection was satisfactory 
ugly dark cheap wood for furniture 
their spa centre is nice and especially when the weather conditions allow you to enjoy the heated outdoor pool 
) it is very old world charme ( i 
would stay again if i could pick up a similar rate . 
as you enter into the hyatt regency you will step into a beautiful lobby with big chandel 
the cardio machines only have two english tv channels 
some people have complained that there is n't much to do around the area but since shinjuku 
i have only two minor complaints 
on the top floor 
room size is large in tokyo standard 
also the buffet breakfast is very good 
reasonable prices 
in most indian hotels - the first few years when a property opens - there is a lot of 
good size bathroom with large shower and bath and all the usual add ons 
he took us to the domestic airport 
hotel is big and located near the subway 
the shower was great and the bathroom was good with the standard japanese washlet 
wonderful hotel with good access to the city and the international airport 
a good enjoyable nights stay 
not good value for the money 
everyone from the security guards to the managers was friendly 
and is located close to the international airport 
not easy to walk anywhere 
the beds are very comfortable and the rooms are n't tiny 
the breakfast was awesome 
experience exceeded what i had expected pool side views please . 
nice and has great service 
the bathroom was good sized 
higher floors facing the pool are nicer and quieter 
just separated by glass wall ( with curtain if you do n't want ) - loved that 
i was especially impressed with the soft bed linen that was used 
the old building is pretty 
well the room service and the food options and taste is horrible 
there are still a lot of smoking rooms in japan ) and the bathrooms are bright with lots of 
the rooms are clean and i had a room facing the pool which was nice 
this is the first time staying here 
a good and well located property that will meet the needs of both business and tourist visitors - few of 
we particulary like the generous seating available at the lobby while waiting for our tour bus 
this hotel 's service is outstanding as per japanese culture of respect and discipline 
but not on the higher floors 
it 's about 15min tuktuk ride away from the tourist central area but the rides 
the flights from narita to san francisco usually depart around 4-6pm and many other 
the main reception area looked grand and the pool area was very pretty and relaxing to sit around after a 
the lobby itself is quite a large space and the check in counters 
wish we could have stayed longer 
i believe it is also convenient if you are on a business trip and the office is in the area 
big bath 
the bangkok intercontinental is superior to phonm pen , however it meets the standard and the 
9 for pad thai and 14 for a pretty good burger and fries 
go for a harbour view if you can 
i was very impress by the quality of service and the staff 
the location is n't bad 
and had a lovely bathtub and bathroom 
stayed here for 3 nights for a meeting and this is an average resort 
stayed here on an overnight layover as an alternative to the usual suspects near the airport 
a really great location 
as usual though breakfast was fabulous 
there is n't much around the location and to call it an airport hotel is stretching it a little 
( turns out the only hotels right next to the airport are clarion and radisson 
the airport express train has a free shuttle bus service from kowloon station to the hotel every 10 
more like halfway between the airport and the city center 
softest and fullest pillows i have ever received at a hotel 
the hotel is very center to all needs 
strange feel to the place i was n't sure whether i was checking into a hotel or a 
they can cut down their operational costs and make it complimentary to guests and at same time reduce their environmental 
the beds are a little hard but after a long day shopping or sight seeing you do n't really 
breakfast was good and the location is great 
very small bathroom but very large area for beverage making 
recommended before next day flight 
we parked in the garage easily ( around the back ) and the drive over to the airport was easy 
the hotel has a free shuttle to dublin airport 
very spacious and well appointed rooms 
i visited for a one day meeting held at the business centre and everything went smoothly 
other bonuses were the free wifi which was very simple to access and the shuttle bus to the airport 
we had early flights that would have been difficult to make if we had stayed in the city center 
they gave us coupons for free drinks in the lobby but this is n't right 
the bed was very hard 
large pool area but nearby beach is rocky 
front desk happy to see you 
good location but expensive 
this was our first visit to hong kong - so after much research we decided to treat ourselves 
we used the free shuttle bus 
the general manager is on top of things 
poor lighting 
property is ok and close to the airport 
check out the spa - fantastic 
a nice personal touch 
udaipur has three great hotels - the taj 
great pool 
there was a curved sofa close to the end with the balcony and a huge king side bed at the 
this was my first visit to this hotel and i look forward to coming back again 
staff were very friendly and the food was delicious 
a nice little framed photo from our sunset lake cruise and complementary desserts from the chef 
people at the reception were efficient 
with a beautiful pool 
we stayed here for an overnighter and liked the location 
the rooms are large and look nice 
nearer to the historical city than taj 
while on the restaurant floor you do n't get the strong fish sauce smell 
the reception and concierge staffs were very helpful but i wish to share my experience with hotel 
many thanks ) through to our departure 4 nights later we were very impressed with this hotel 
i was given a late checkout until 4pm free of charge 
a superlative property 
breakfast in the lounge was surprising good and varied 
the newy opened shopping mall ( terminal 21 ) is just around the corner 
they are free to walk around 
this hotel is situated close to asok station 
this was the 4th stay at the hotel for my wife and we opted for a sea-facing 
rooms are spacious and clean 
rooms accessories and amenities are basic 
they arrange very nice private tours - no bus with lots of annoying 
it 's sufficient but one can always take very good breakfasts at cafes nearby 
the hotel check-in area was not crowded and there were two receptionists but we were being kept 
very near the beach though the beach is not clean 
its not really freshly juiced 
although the hotel is relatively quiet 
the hotel is a 5min walk from sukhumvit mrt station and 10min walk 
and very stayable 
some not even on the very limited wine list 
had dinner everyday at the curries- great food and server 
the bed is good 
the breakfast buffet was good and service was attentive and quick 
nice hotel in a good location 
they consistently underwhelm you with their checkin process - slow 
the separate toilet is a auto-lid opening push button affair ( there are two toilets in the 
just order it from the menu o be served fresh on your table- loved the cave bar 
big comfortable villas with huge double beds 
if i go to macau again i would definitely stay here again-the service was excellent 
you have a cold drink in your hand and you are being checked into paradise 
one of the best overall hotels i have stayed 
nice gym and indoor pool jacuzzi though abit small jacuzzi given number of 
other times the appetizers and main-courses arrived simultaneously 
the beaches were n't as nice as when i was there 15 years ago 
good rooms 
there are several treadmills which are good but the one i used kept stopping abruptly 
stayed at the marriott for 5 nights and had a very pleasant experience 
the location is about 2 subway stops from downtown 
an excellent level of security and a very good secure parking complete an hotel that it 's no doubt 
there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel at various times of the day to drop you off at 
the property is located approximately 450m ( 10 mins ) away from the jetty 
it has an excellent roof top bar 
-underground parking-large so good availability and cheap mid week-poolcons 
there is a nice pool and golf course and tennis courts 
there 's a mini fridge too 
may be i could refuse to pay this extra charge as i was never been informed about it beforehand 
clean and the lounge is very decent to have an evening brunch 
palm beach is near the ( invisible ) staff village and the bass noise was truly horrible 
and they have a newly built casino at the basement 
nice furnishing and a great king size bed 
nice modern room in central location with good hotel facilities and great staff 
this is a huge and beautiful resort 
the spacious corner room i had with great view and highly functional equipment 
concierge and front desk staff also most helpful 
the breakfast buffet was good 
no door between the bathroom and the bedroom area - hence no real sense of privacy after that spicy dinner 
exec room was huge - kinda like a city apartment with windows all round 
the spa service and treatment was very professional and relaxing 
i ordered room service and the chicken soup was the worst i have ever had ( how can you mess 
narrow beach ) that were a letdown-- again relative to four seasons expectations 
i highly recommend this hotel is you have a short layover and down want to get caught up in 
i stayed at the hotel for a conference and then spent the weekend with my wife 
service great facility needs attention 
a flashlight and the like 
late night accommodation due to cancelled flight 
best menu item is their famous bon bon 's so good after a meal and the temperature is warm 
the service is impeccable 
with the doors of the balcony open at night 
due to a delayed flight , cathay put us up here on the way to bangkok . 
we ate in the dinning room and the quality of the food was very poor and expensive 
c ) restaurantswe enjoyed the two beachside restaurants and probably found their ocean and sunset views their greatest 
despite having free wi fi in hotel lobby i was unable to access it which was inconvenient 
they also have a great shuttle service to the nearby shopping centre 
luxurious and relaxing 
it 's still definitely the best resort on the coast and arguably 
one of nice hotel in the city the location is near from everything even halal indian restur 
room and bed was large but tired 
terrible musty smell as you enter room 1032 
had an free upgrade 
needed a good renovation and bathroom clean 
while the location is convenient since it is attached to the airport 
the bed was great and the room was clean 
with mini fridge 
clean and nice hotel 
beautiful property and very good service 
why could n't they have just told me when i checked in initially 
the rooms are good and clean 
one pays a rather high price for this convenience 
i ca n't speak for staying overnight at this hotel 
the location is very good for the financial centre and most of the historic sites are within a twenty minute 
as it 's just a short walk from the airport terminal 
there are some good resturant choices in the hotel and a few shops that nobody ever seems to 
the public areas are beautiful 
a 3 minute walk takes you into the terminal and there are lots of better 
extremely professional staff 
bedding was good and room decor average 
we stayed for 4 nights in a rotunda suite with a fabulous view of the harbour and we absolutely 
particularly from the upper floors 
breakfast menu was very good and quite reasonably priced for a hotel at this level 
great location 
i travel quite a bit to boston on work and usually stay at the intercon or langh 
the concierge rob was awesome - got us stunning tickets last minute - to ice hockey game - 
we were rather disappointed in this hotel 
nothing wow but it 's really good value for the price you pay 
pretty standard mid range airport hotel 
food is great as are drinks 
the rooms are well appointed and the room staff were very friendly 
there may be newer better hotels in town 
good-sized room 
the best thing about this hotel is that it is connected to hk airport via the pedestrian bridge ( 
this is a lovely hotel 
poor quality most unhygienic setup imaginable 
the location was very convenient for me 
also no free wifi 
better finished room 
its a really long walk to the hotel from the airport anyway so better to take the free shuttle bus 
i will certainly return here next time i visit brussels 
the hotel is decorated in modern and cozy way and from the entrance you feel good 
we did n't have breakfast at the hotel as there are other cafes around for breakfast and probably cheaper 
with good space for storage 
repacked and were ready to head back to the airport ( right next door ) 
this time getting a good rate at this property was very difficult 
the walk in shower was large 
poor room soundproofing 
we had an early morning flight and the regal was an obvious choice 
the idea of a rooftop bar was one of the things that drew me here 
what more could anyone want of an airport hotel apart from free high speed broadband and they have that too 
it is however a very long walk down to the entrance to the palace 
big and close to the airport 
especially the fried rice and their fried chicken wings 
it is idyllic for those visiting with young kids as the grounds and activities lends itself to a 
novotel is connected to a mall so you have other restaurants to choose from 
choice of restaurants and handy picnic deli take away outlet 
clean and spacious but still no free wifi 
having previously visited spier for wine tasting we decided to stay in the hotel 
located literally next to the terminal it 's great for late arrivals and early departures 
all three were competitively priced 
the bathroom was also spacious with a seperate tub and shower 
very convenient hotel in the airport of hong kong 
even if the hotel is a bit more expensive than other properties near the airport this one is worth it 
great place to freshen up landed and used is place to have a shower and get to work , 
it 's a perfect hotel for overnight transfer at hong kong airport 
which is the main shopping area 
but the city is so hazy & polluted it feels so unpleasant3 ) chinese restaurant is surprisingly 
which had no fixed shower 
despite my booking with spg confirming exec lounge access and free breakfast 
- a turn-down service would have made the room to feel more comfortable . 
poor tv set etci also heard airplanes while trying to sleep and the toilet made noises 5 minutes after 
a major positive feature of being so ideally situated just five minutes walk ( all undercover ) from the airport 
i recently stayed at the regal airport hotel overnight connecting to a morning flight back to the u 
the room was very good 
however their shuttle bus to the airport only commences at 6 
hotel personnel were helpful 
the hotel lobby is large 
ok facilities 
i was stuck in the hong kong airport due to typhoon 
their steaks were some of the best i 've ever hadm the staff friendly and the atmosphere 
i had the best price in all my visits 
good location very easy to find while traveling via hk to other parts of asia 
you get free wifi for only one device at a time in your room 
the hotel is a quaint little property 
the hotel did deliver complimentary coffees to our room 
pool is very nice 
rooms are spacious with good lighting 
has a pool located at one of the roof tops ( 10th floor ) long enough to get some 
visiting iusacel i stay here often and find this jw to be one of the 
huge and chic lobby 
very comfortable bed and fittings of a very good quality 
had tickets in hand headed to security 10 minutes after leaving hotel lobby 
i had to wait a night for my connecting flight back to singapore 
i 'd requested a high floor via the advance e-concierge and all was in 
separate bath 
fit and finish is very high quality 
next time we visit i will try to find a less expensive hotel in one of the three neighborhoods of 
the old town 
the city was walkable from the hilton and there is a train near by 
this is the nicest airport hotel i have stayed in 
there was a separate shower compartment with privacy door and a separate wc compartment with privacy door 
the best airport hotel i know 
much the best beijing airport hotel with excellent shuttle bus service but t3 is lacking distance 
their suggestions for sightseeing were helpful due to the fact that many tourist places are not open until after 
probably the best airport hotel i 've ever been to 
we could walk to everything and the desk staff had maps and was great with directions 
very impressive and huge lobby area 
they asked for an extra charge when i asked for a room with a better view 
i think this is the core service an airport hotel provides in addition to the room and it is an 
the executive lounge is very nice with drinks and food 
had a delicious dinner 
a good spot to spend the weekend and great value for money too if you go for executive rooms 
bad room 
location is great close to main square 
steps away from this plaza is the inka museum and some nice shops and good restaurants like cic 
a short walk from the main plaza in cusco 
the breakfast and coffee was good but it was always very crowded so that they opened areas which were reserved 
everything was as expected and i 'm looking forward to my next trip to marco polo next 
it is always dealt with on my next visit with professionalism and grace 
i only realized that there is a second and nicer pool in the historic part on my last day 
for the locals , you will also enjoy some complimantary benefits on weekdays so it 
the furnishings are modern 
neoclassical style of the building is perfect and the lobby makes the biggest impression 
had a great buffet dinner here 
silver trays ( we prefer ordering their special kaya toast ) laden with tea 
food is great 
near the very busy street 
slightly bizarrely laid out when the bathroom is quick funky but you actually walk through it to get 
and no nice restaurants outside the hotel 
the hotel is not in the best location 
same connection throughout the hotel- free shuttle buses to kl sentral and bukit bintang 
the hotel bar restaurant complete live piano music is exquisite 
meaning we had to drive dangerously fast to the airport 
with plenty of variety and very fairly priced 
outdoor shower 
good personal touch 
we especially liked the many available settings for private 
we were here for their high tea 2 months ago and found the hotel very nice 
elephant visits and anything you 'll need 
international chains that offer good value and clean 
swim in the various pools 
this hotel might give you just the basics but the location is perfect 
he then got the room rate wrong twice without offering an apology 
the adult space is equally lovely - huge double beds that you can lose youself in and that are 
strong wifi 
all these little things made for a tremendous impression on us as we really felt valued throughout our short stay 
stylish decor 
amazing beds and huge bathrooms 
i requested extra toiletries on day two and they were brought to our room but house keeping took them 
i am not a big fan of golf 
this is a clean and comfortable modern hotel 
one of the nicest & luxurious hotels i 've ever stayed in 
pretty good shower 
but personally i would not recommend this hotel to leisure travellers because of the lack of nearby restaurants and shopping 
guests are made feel welcome by the staff who is always friendly 
i had a room on the smoking floor ( no non-smoking available ) and it did have a 
but beds are too hard 
the neighborhood is full of cheap but not particularly good restaurants 
by then most of the pool is almost in the shade 
from the minute we stepped into the lobby we were treated like royalty 
the room was lovely and extremely clean ( no musty smells ) and made up twice daily 
since it can get pretty warm in some parts of the lobby and the restaurant 
the poolside is very nice with a large selection of day beds and chaise lounges with 
the room design is a bit odd for a couple 
a grand staircase greets you as you get out of the car and whisks you up to the cutting 
complete with all the modern amenities 
perfectly comfy bed 
just 10 minutes walk to both the bts ( sala daeng ) and mrt ( sil 
it has excellent ambiance 
nott many places to eat on same street but in the vicinity lots of shops and near patp 
this property is very focussed on the delivery of its wellness concept and everything supports this strategy 
the national express coach terminal and the main shopping areal 
the facilities are adequate and the breakfast spread was impressive 
the rooms are very artistic trendy in their design 
lobby area looks like early 1980 
it had the best coffee of all hotel restaurants 
very modern and spacious 
the mini bar was inside a closet and the kettle inside a drawer ( and it worked in the drawer 
great breakfast buffet and very nice staffwent to the spa for 2 hours massage and facial and was excellent 
but they all seem to have the same fantastic bathrooms and beds 
the property itself is in great shape will the touches and amenities one would expect with the le meridian 
a truly special hotel in a city that has a lot of great hotels 
le meridien 's hotel reward program and access free room upgrades 
it has hundreds of restaurants in close proximity 
breakfast and dinner are superb and the illy coffee is made perfectly 
modern room setting in a great location 
spent three nights at hotel in two different rooms 
the room was quiet and breakfast was good 
great room and facilities 
these windows are double glazed for noise and semi frosted so that there is a degree of privacy 
i like le meridien hotels and this one used to be one of my favorite around the world 
also had mould in the shower and the furniture just felt dirty 
is not near the beach but close to the financial area 
i asked to make a reservation to one of the popular restaurants and the guy never knew what it was 
i have never physically been stopped from exiting a taxi at a hotel front door by hotel staff before 
and i had a view of the hills and the hollywood sign 
very tasty meals overall and good breakfast menu ( note 
service is patchy but that is mainly due to the language barrier if you do n't speak ch 
there is a starbucks very close to the hotel 
but the beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious 
wonderful stay from top to bottom and a heavenly bed made it complete 
very good hotel but not luxurious 
stayed in the east wing with a view of the lake and a small balcony 
the area has a nice mall 
it had nice decor 
it is next to a very new large shopping mall 
my wife and i regularly travel around the world and i would rate this as one of the nicest 
and a good size 
club lounge offers good food but hi tea is from 3 which is rather late and stops you enjoying evening 
just a short walk from the botanical gardens and the main station but it was hot so we u 
huge bathroom 
and it was very spacious with two decent sized balconies 
very close by is an excellent italian bar restaurant ( balencia ) and you can walk to the 
different floors 
do n't like finding long hair in what are supposed to be fresh towels 
i found less expensive little cafes for smoothies & yogurt 
it did n't help that there was a screaming baby staying next to us 
the bar in the hotel was rocking although i never managed to visit and there is a lovely gastro pub 
i did however get to experience the room both restaurants and the gym 
2 tv 's - which was spacious and the beds were separated by the bathroom 
the shower is too small and water pressure inadequate 
the public spaces are hence very busy and it and makes the check in check out process very chaotic and 
for is huge colonial rooms 
area is not the best and location is okit is a 3 floors in total so if you are 
breakfast buffet good but can be busy 
cafeteria type restaurant was good 
in a different room 
very well located and with the charm of old colonial buildings but with everything renovated to 5 standards 
it is difficult to understand that this is the same building 
stayed in a beautiful suite on the 32nd floor 
location was ideal for us as the street food area of 19th street was a short taxi away and 
the concierge is also good 
management of a very high standard . 
breakfast in the dining room is also excellent 
especially given the very mediocre quality of the food in the chatterbox 
if this property is really close to the nature 
he looked at me pointed and said kiosk and then proceeded to walk off in the direction of the 
a few days at danna based on great reviews followed by a week at datai which was absolutely 
with spacious room and bathroom 
the natural environment amongst which the datai is nestled is simply awe inspiring- the flora and 
toilet amenities wide assorted 
the private beach is wonderful and you sometimes felt like you had the place to yourself 
the plunge pool is perfect for 2 to cool off from the heat of the day in complete privacy 
the food delicious and the bespectacled monkeys entertaining 
i only stayed the one night and tried the breakfast which was awash with cheap items for tourists and 
but the offerings of smaller intimate high quality fare 
with all necessary amenities 
the comfy beds and soft towels 
the best single lounge chair and ottoman 
good view and good selection of dim sum and nicely made coffee 
the staff informed me that they have changed the rules and that mr 
it was an overall pleasant experience 
overall an ok stay but with some fine tuning they could do much better 
lower lobby is dark and busy as always but staff is alerted to give priority for house guest to get 
great location with good service and amenities 
our first visit 
across the road is a complex with dansai y100 8 shop with amazing things to buy 
and wound up with a double bed the size of a shoebox 
i paused to enjoy the beautiful art pieces 
the kyoto train station is a destination in and of itself 
huge selection and top quality 
when we arrived at the front desk 
the room was nice 
there are far better options out there 
clean average size for japan furniture is in good condition bed is comfortable room service is nothing special wifi 
given its facilities and the number of staff we had expected a good deal from this hotel but were left 
the rooms are very beautiful with african decor 
admittedly the wait wo n't kill you - it 's just tedious when you are on holiday 
in the rooms we found small insects everywhere so make sure you use the mosquito net ( like small beat 
veery amusing . 
we decided to walk from the gion area to the hotel one evening and it took over an hour 
we had a quick one night stay so to be able to eat and shop right at the hotel train 
kyoto has many popular hotels 
i had a room with a balcony overlooking the pool which i would highly recommend 
location is great - attached to the amazing kyoto station and a huge shopping mall restaurants and opposite 
the lunch diner options in the hotel looked good and plenty at first instance but after having tried one 
alright rooms - great location 
clean and the huge bathroom has a traditional and ultramodern bathing arrangements 
the rest of the hotel not worth the price 
i rather suspect our twin room on 26th floor is basically a single 
it was nice to have little placecards in english in the room telling you to call them if you 
in a central location that is ultimately overpriced 
the hotel has restaurants throughout the hotel to chose from if you decide to stay in - we chose the 
it was my first visit to jogjakarta and java 
due to the excellent location 
room in front of pool is great 
contrary to a previous complaint about pool cleaners with plastic buckets 
to compensate that the beds are very comfortable with pretty good tv channels selection 
good waffles and pancakes 
the dinner was expensive and you did feel you were sitting in a corridor even in the dinning room 
be my idea of a top tier hotel for a honeymoon ( if you are a couple or honey 
the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean 
and also an artificial beach 
the hotel is also an elegant modernised 1918 historic building that is charming 
the menu is extensive but what amazed me was how good it was 
i really liked the overall ambience of the hotel 
the view is wonderful and the facilities are well organized 
the gym was good with modern equipments 
but overall this is a high quality beach resorts that reflect the bali touch at the same time 
this one only slightly let us down due to the lack of a mini bar and shelf space that i 
the common areas ( lobby and bar ) are very nicely done 
the staffs are friendly and helpful 
the lounge is huge and really well equipped 
they offer some good dinner items as well 
the balcony was perfect for breakfast and afternoon tea 
sure the 'butler service' is just another name for room service with free tea and coffee but 
it seemed like they tried to keep the closer tables for people without kids which was a bit illogical 
wonder why other hotels didnt offer hammock 
apart from a small delay at check-in 
we stayed in one of the deluxe lagoon-access suites complete with 24-hour butler 
we joined the high tea one afternoon and were deeply disappointed 
the restaurants are very good and do not carry the usual supplements we have experienced at many resorts when on 
steam-room and thermal pool 
the executive suite was the perfect selection for our 5 night stay 
lagoon access is a must 
the check in was smooth and the lobby impressive 
the resort is in a gated area which means there are no other shops etc unless you walk fifteen 
the bar staff is amazing and very friendly 
the hotel is a nice hotel with a private beach ( beautiful white sand ) and the service was also 
excellent water pressure in shower 
nice small bar 
the service was very good and the concierge was very helpful 
i love their small outdoor terrace 
the popular night bazaar is right at the doorstep of the hotel 
the level of service is high and the skills and helpfulness of the concierge desk superior 
excellent hotel in close to everything 
not much to add , more expensive than other hotels in the area , but also better . 
we had to keep the curtains closed at all times as all other windows to that courtyard are hallways 
higher floors have better views 
the front desk staff that checked us in was very unfriendly 
the bedrooms are large and the bathrooms are very well appointed 
but quality is good l- the bar too is tops 
excellent city hotel in the heart of auckland this is a fabulous hotel on the waterfront of a 
plenty of fresh pastries and breads also in a well stocked buffet section 
with separate seating area and small balcony overlooking the viaduct harbour and the bathroom is equally large with 
the internet fast 
when hotels achieve this quality there is always something to nitpick about in the search for perfection 
it 's also very close to fantastic restaurants 
and a quick walk to roma termini and piazza repubblica ( which will 
the reception are and the foyer were beautifully designed and they raved on about the 100 's 
and still has its old charm 
the service has been great and the room has been comfy as with a awesome bed and even better 
it is within 10 minutes cab ride to vatican . 
10-15 min walking you can reach auckland busy street 
the staff were very personable and made us feel welcome 
with beautiful bathrooms and although we did n't use the rest of the facilities we did walk by the 
with a lovely bathroom with all the usual amenities one would expect of a hotel of this standard 
great spot but value questionable 
doing the bare minimum as is the norm in australian hospitality industry 
it has a small buffet breakfast for hotel guests only 
welcoming and helpful staff added to the experience 
will definitely stay here again next time 
we 've been avoiding the novotel chain for some time as it has progressively been cheap 
my one complaint with the hotel is the room service 
the room is huge and it does not make any sense at all 
breakfast is a nice bonus 
front desk staff were very helpful and friendly 
shuttle bus from the airport was fine as was check in and wifi 
the viaduct 21 cafe still makes one of the best coffees in nz and the menu 
he bar area is very basic but in line with other express hotels 
room good - bed firm with flexible reading lamps over bed 
hotel and room super clean 
the bath and shower were lovely and the coffee machine and well stocked mini-bar were good 
go for dinner we were blown awayinternet service is expensive and complicated 
breakfast is a bit bland but overall it is a good value for money hotel for those with business 
the hotel nice 
friendly and fabulous fluffy bed 
there are so many restaurants and cafes nearby 
and the bathroom although there was no separate shower area 
breakfast and the buffet restaurant served excellent food with plenty of variety 
good bar at whisky blue ( still ) 
breakfast service was great 
quite a big room as well 
5m2 - you cannot be 2 persons in the bathroom at the same time - there is simply 
from what i could tell on-site the towers rooms are on floors 7-9 and the club 
if you order breakfast it may come by lunch time and half of the breakfast area is empty and they 
no tub and the shower looked like something out of my high school football locker room 
my first visit to jordan 
location is not the greatest as no restaurants or shops are in the vicinity 
had to change room the next day because my mom could not sleep at all because of the noise 
very very small for the price 
a small quaint place if you want to stay in del mar . 
the bed is so soft and a good night sleep was impossible 
the only flaw that i experience was that the towels had a strange smell 
i went down and slammed the card on the desk and the ruffian manning the desk 
there is a docking station right opposite the hotel and i used it extensively 
the front desk representative assured and guaranteed me that they would only charge us for one day 
pleasant room 
would get very good rating if the room had not been that small and was better insulated from corridor noise 
they have free internet in the lobby 
one can barely move in - i always got upgraded to duplex or larger suites and multiple times has 
nice lobby and bar 
for the price it is quite good but some issues keep it from the top rating . 
and if you want to use the spa hot tub by the pool area , go early in the 
the hotel is directly connected to the rideau center which is a huge shopping mall 
a elegant hotel located blocks from central park 
a shower designed to let you set the temperature without getting wet 
especially the black out curtains 
it had 2 comfortable chairs and a foot stool 
an engineer came immediately to open my safe which had an error code 
this unpretentious hotel is ok provided you avoid a room too close to the freeway especially rooms on 
one night hotel only 
good airport hotel 
front desk very professional and courteous 
great airport shuttle service and convenient location opposite a shopping centre with plenty of restaurants etc for a short stop 
1 building with one side facing the main road 
perhaps she should have checked that i was a black member before shooting her mouth off like that and i 
the hotel only provided basic amenities - shower gel and shampoo 
there are a couple bars and restaurants to keep you well fed and happy throughout your stay 
nice pool and charming 
the bed and linens were very comfortable and we had a great couple of nights here 
the property has a beautiful landscape and such a lovely atmosphere that makes you isolated from the city which is 
just a short walk from the central attractions and transport links 
breakfast was a disapppointment but frankly there are plenty of places nearby that are better quality and 
the complaints were minor when compared to the overall experience of staying in this hotel 
very nice rooms 
having previously stayed at the hyatt ( now intercontinental ) we would stay at the renez 
the bed was comfortable and there were two different pillow types ( soft and hard ) 
a gong was wrung and we were greeted with smiles and warm welcomes 
traditional atmosphere in a beautiful surrounding and 
quiet and charming 
the lobby is light and airy and one floor down where the vapor coffee shop sits is another lobby 
we ate a couple of times in the hotel - a club sandwich in the bar was very good and 
the hotel is wonderful 
there were noises coming from the air condition and the mosquito really bothered me 
very good hotel - great service 
countless restaurants and several shows to see 
if i 'd have arrived and seen that it 'd have walked straight out again 
the hotel feels like a resort and the pools are attractive and there is a beach 
the pool was excellent and beach front location was also great 
other than the checkin fee and resort fee the hotel is a worthy stay 
the spa has great potential as well and the physical plant was built to good standards 
i guess if you like the big pools and rooms 
3 out of 4 of our rooms were upgraded to fabulous spacious suites 
check with front desk and avoid the wing that you can hear outdoor parties 
the local food restaurant serves fresh and nice food and is located on the beach 
always crowded lobby is frequented by flight crews who have their own check-in desk 
i was happy to receive a free upgrade to harbour view 
the only negative part of this hotel is the long queues for cabs and the expensive wines on room 
nice spot with good harbour biews 
the room was disappointing 
switched rooms and it did the same ( 7 floors lower than the first room ) 
there are a couple of restaurants right on the river walk on the lower level of the hotel and across 
always ask for a high floor if you want a better view in hong kong 
our room on a 7th floor was nice and clean with nice balcony 
service at the front desk is efficient 
i found so much hair in the bed when we checked in and there were 3 different types 
there is an excellent fitness centre 
everything was great with the room and the breakfast buffet was wonderful 
the bathroom was fully functional if a little dated 
at causeway bay which is easily accessible from any directions 
they are a good size for hong kong and well equipped with an iron and board 
restaurants are everywhere near the hotel vicinity 
this was my first visit to canberra and i chose this hotel as it appeared pretty close to the 
we arrived pretty light after a very long flight 
you may have to rwquest for one with a full bath 
i would defenitely try different hotels such as the marcopolo or the mira just because 
but fantastic location - right in the middle of causeway bay 
the bungalow has enough space that you never feel as though you are on top of anyone but 
there was nothing really wrong with the hotel 
so you can expect they can maintain a high level of service quality 
bustlely lobby area with tiny little cafe near the lifts which also stocks little portuguese 
modern showers etc are lacking 
including steam and sauna separated in the male female changing areas 
02 etc have great harbour views 
with easy access to the mtr system 
when i showed up was told we do n't have any rooms there so we 've upgraded you 
a retreat in the middle of a busy city 
the couple next door was having noisy conjugal relations ( we could everything through the paper thin walls and 
good value for your money 
bathroom excellent and swimming pool with sun lounging outside area a real bonus 
they are genuine and sincere . 
it 's great that they provide a mobile to take around with you so that you can always have 
but that is not a bad thing as only a short cab ride 
large comfy bed and very nice bathroom 
okay hotel with an outstanding restaurant 
staff has always has welcome pleasant smile and ready to take that extra step to help out 
on the bright side gym is good and breakfast was outstanding 
it 's in a really good location 
it is pricey - internet 
but the f&b as well as internet prices are exorbitant 
we had 6 nights here with an all inclusive packageeverything is perfect here the staff were so polite and 
previous reviews have highlighted the poor centralized airconditioning 
this is a large hotel by the convention center and the harrah 's casino 
10 - 14 it was like i was staying in two entirely different hotels 
and room service was fast 
the bedroom is big and so are the bathroom 
it was convenient and a nice breakfast 
also room service menu if you get hungry in the evening 
comfy beds & pillows 
some part of the hotel is quite dated and time for an upgrade 
checked into a club room on the 17th floor and was impressed with the quality of the room and 
the room comes with all the amenities that you would expect from a crowne plaza 
the beauty of the old hotels is that the rooms tend to be larger but as i am there only 
average airport hotel 
it is a shame that the senior management owners of this hotel ca n't be bothered to ensure that 
we stayed one night as we had an early morning flight and then we took the free shuttle to the 
this hotel feels modern with good sized rooms 
the standalone bathtub - everything 
do n't know what it would be like if you were actually visiting dallas but if you need 
the wiki said that we can access shops inside secure area 
nice touches like kueh and tea basket on arrival 
fantastic bathroom with rain shower and separate old-fashioned bath 
library and public areas 
which was redone to reflect the old peranakan charms 
and i have to admit this is one of the best in this little town 
the big let down was the poor maintenance 
and there are many local food options outside the hotel 
compared to the other hotels in the city by far the best choice 
this was of the quality you expect from grand hyatt 
good shower and nice bath tub 
ample parking with security available but no shelter 
i wish more airports had this type of hotel . 
we ate both nights at the sea gypsy restaurants next door by the beach 
beautifully appointed rooms 
there are other little restaurants around which we heard were good 
there is a nice infinity pool close by 
they have a very pleasant pool and what look to be reasonable gym equipment - i would not mind using 
the bathroom had a separate tub and shower 
rooms are the same but beds 
the hotel front desk staff provide a very professional service 
if you fly direct from europe to this island first keep your money for shopping later 
room safe etc and then bathroom toilet 
the onsen is on the top floor and very relaxing 
casino is a nice low key casino 
gym is relatively small for the size property with absolutely no view and lacking some equipment 
worst hotel casino show we have ever seen do not go to the eddie griffin show no matter 
the rooms are quite spacious and the beds are comfy 
the front desk was friendly when we checked in but that was about it 
the public bath was great 
not exactly in the busy city centre but close to everywhere 
the service at the coffee bar was also missing with wrong orders and lack of stock when the property was 
during 6-9 pm the sound is so loud that the windows are vibrating 
modern with very good quality 
crisp bedding 
rooms are average and amenities are the usual ones 
rooms are a good size 
the breakfast buffet is very impressive and the service is prompt and courteous 
pretty good for an airport hotel 
toilet good size and with good amenities 
for an airport hotel where everyone is going to be time conscious this whole process needs to be improved 
the bathroom had a separate shower and bath 
the hotels gym is well used by the wary travellers and the equipment range is great 
in general the service levels of this hotel are what you would expect of a hotel in this class but 
very good hotel in a beautiful setting 
i 'm a pretty fast walker and it took me almost 15 minutes to get there 
tastefully decorated and clean 
the room was a good size with a huge and very comfy super-king sized bed 
we booked a suite with was very spacious and included one kitchen 
but given you can operate it from inside and outside the bathroom 
the lovely infinity pool with the bar just beside was amazing 
and a free shuttle service to the nearby bts train station 
small thing but a bit annoying when you have a slippery soap in your hand 
a rather large paddling pool 
i found that the facilities were great - everything you 'd expect from a quality resort - the pools 
an outstanding property 
but the exec floor one was excellent 
we 've got a nice room with big bathroom 
the restaurants were good and whilst tide has beautiful views 
with separate rain shower and a huge bath 
would definitely come back again for my next trip to bangkok 
who helped us out with telephone calls and the possibility to take a refreshing shower after our check-out 
the pool was clean and towels were soon provided for us 
the pool is large and attractive and the hotel has a small but well equipped gym 
there are much better choices in bangkok . 
although this seemed very odd the food was great 
the bed was excellent - great comfort 
lumbini park view is a nicer outlook 
a pretty decent spread 
there is a free shuttle service to the nearest bts train station at phloen chit but 
3 ) very thin walls with weak sound insulation 
complimentary ( warm to cold ) snacks provided 
the breakfast was quite expensive considering the quality of condiments and the coffee were both below standard but the 
just changing the room to higher floor 
i suspect this size include the hidden area under the wood panels and the hallway outside the room 
hotel itself if located a short walk to crown and southbank 
good storage 
hotel is also handy for bangkok transit system with phloen chit station short walk away 
plenty of eateries and shops close by 
not at all what you can find in other thai hotels 
the ferry slow and the bridges jammed0 
the gym is good and the spa excellent 
beautiful hotel away from main jakarta 
breakfast of good quality and choice 
certainly up there as one of bangkok 's great 5-star hotels 
service at front desk was very cold 
the pool and the area around the pool is very nice 
the executive lounge is a great respite from the hustle of the day -as well as offering 
great lounge bar with excellent live jazz music 
the customer service is really great - i have never witnessed such attention to detail from a starwood property 
good 5 star hotel 
there are better located hotels if you want to be within walking distance 
we absolutely loved our entire stay here 
hotel is connected to a mall 
and there is totally no privacy 
sheraton has the best lounge female staff with last names such as kang 
each staff member works hard to make their hotel feel like a second home 
nice glasswindows between bathroon and sleepting area 
i think that the check-in could be done at club lounge but that is another story 
the first unique and truly exceptional feature a new visitor will notice is the lobby & bar on the 41 
the food was great and the restaurants were enjoyable 
i found the spread good but i have experienced better spread in other hotels in india 
while 4 of us were waiting outside to enter our room was was one meter away 
there are beautiful grounds but it is very spread out 
that 's worth a trip over there 
will definitely stay again 
great location if you are traveling to manchester by train as it is just across the street from the 
and facilities consistent with that ranking 
the food was nice and the staff were excellent 
there are different restaurants and we visited all except for flame 
the room was a very good size and had a large bathroom 
they have quick laundry service 
on my most recent trip i had a corner room which was truly excellent - very large room with equally 
the floors are long corridors with very uninspiring views of either main roads or the railway lines 
my first impression was not the best as the card machine was not working and the staff blamed my card 
the staffs are friendly and i love the complimentary warm toddy served in the evening 
i loved the lounge at night which provided free drinks and finger food 
the noise of the next room 's door was sometimes as if it was my door which i found 
this also gave us access to the lounge ( afternoon snacks and drinks ) and free breakfast in the buffet 
my preferred hotel in beijing 
great helpful staff 
it is in a very touristy area of san francisco ( fisherman 's wharf ) which 
but electrical outlets and light switches thoughtfully laid out 
there are many big malls around with a short ride of taxi 
decent sized rooms 
there is an excellent gym with treadmills 
with complimentary wireless internet 
it was clean and the bed was comfy 
my only negative comment would be the gym opening hours 
from the moment we arrived to our departure four days later 
staying in one of the signature suites on several levels 
it has a terrible smell of fumes in it and also mould 
30 pm onwards was delicious and value for money 
wonderful trendy hotel 
make sure you get a renovated room as the old rooms are simply foul 
but there were nice vegetarian options and as the only reason you 'd stay here is waiting for a 
self service checkin checkout is easy to use and well designed 
and a really lively lobby bar area that is fantastic for connecting with people in person whilst you give your 
while having a mall nearby is nice 
low glass topped table & padded chair 
) very fine restaurants at reasonable prices 
room is modern and has all the necessary amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel in india 
even in other good hotels ) 
good array of shops for silk and jewelery 
the pool area is lovely 
the rooms are modern and spacious 
we had a nice neo suite which had a separate living area with a sofa 
the pool at this hotel is perfect huge and very clean 
using the free shuttle service the hotel was convenient to the trains in and out if nyc 
an airport hotel 
the breakfast dining facilities looked modern with bright decor & the gym was well equipped for a good workout 
the trident is a little expensive but the holt does offer package discounts that cost conscious visitors need 
the buffet breakfast had a good spread 
it 's a short walk to dubai mall so 
good service 
good ol' solid property belonging to the oberoi group-really top of the line 35- 
great shower and bathroom 
the shower was one of those combined bath shower affairs 
and as i checked in late at night and was only staying one night i decided not to fuss nor 
the hotel has an excellent lobby and other facilities and it is a good to chill out after visiting the 
the one major problem was the disturbing noise which interrupted our sleep as the rehearsals for the celebration of 
with excellent wifi 
indiana jones is one of the 5 best oriental restaurants in india 
who is amongst the nicest i have ever met in my over 200 nights in hotel each year of 
nothing original or warm in what they do or say specially front desk 
bed comfy and rooms quiet 
including restaurants and front desk ( special mention to the night manager mohammed who was on duty when 
khun toon called me after ordering room service to make sure the food was right 
very good bathroom and excellent service 
rooms are comfy and spacious with all the amenities you need 
it means it is up to the standards of hilton 
they did think very well on the variety of power sockets available at the desk and bedside tables 
the breakfast buffet had a good selection of food 
from reception to housekeeping the staff was exceptional 
separate shower with rainshower 
rooms are very pleasant , and everything works well . 
sea salt and the thai place are great restaurants 
the front desk didnt bother to greet us 
my husband went straight to the gym and said the facilities were great 
gorgeously decorated room and a very boutique hotel kind of vibe for a large hotel 
hilton and doubletree are back to back with easy access between the 2 
wonder if there is new manager 
very quiet area and little outside noise if facing to the bay 
there are plenty of good restaurants and shopping in this area 
this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel and i expect the equivalent service . 
it 's out of town but only an easy taxi ride away 
the hotel has a nice bar and beautiful outdoor seating on good weather days 
the adult-only pool does not have that many spots available and we saw kids there at times which 
i 'll give you a free upgrade to a very nice ocean view 
coffee and tea are freshly made 
it misses some comfortable seating with sofas to make the happy hours more enjoyable 
my only problem with the adult pool area is the pool staff 's apparent disregard for adult pool rules 
restaurant offer rather limited but breakfast buffet was very good 
all rooms were clean and properly serviced by housekeeping 
towel cards are required for towels and all beach and poolside amenities are extra and pricey 
but there are many hotels in the immediate area that are a better value 
the best facility is the awesome beach in front of the hotel and perfect water temperature 
indeed an oasis one might say 
needs a refurb the interiors are a bit dated and , in my room , in need of a 
strong coffee 
also sha tin area offers nearby interesting attractions 
we typically arrive very late at night from the flights in and they can always get you good food anyway 
if only the chinese waiters and hotel staff could be trained well in listening and communication skills 
my only criticisms would be the patchy nature of the internet access and the antediluvian coffee 
room turned out to be of good sizebut furniture are worn 
good wifi line 
pool and spa facilities good 
the pool n kids area looks good but too cold to swim in winter 
was on the club floor and room had a great view of the bay 
thanks again to the amazing staff 
the public areas 
i ordered room service one evening due to jet lag and the food was wonderful 
nice decoration 
the hotel itself will be undergoing much needed renovation during the next months ( or so we have been told 
this low quality was evident from the moment i arrived at the hotel 
free wifi 
overall a great stay 
this hotel is nicely placed 
the front desk sevice was good 
with a small kitchenette with all the amenities and utensils 
the views from the club lounge terrace are lovely 
had a good sized 3rd floor room with a king bed and sofa 
but prices are high ( albeit not really for hong kong ) 
a word of warning -- room rates are high given the quality of the property 
pool in the back patio is a must if you have kids and if it 's warm outside 
large bathtubs 
sleep quality overall was good 
gym and pool are modern ( gym refitted while i was there with both resistance machines and free 
i think those who select this hotel may need to re-consider 
a fraction of the price of more centrally located hotels but with an excellent rail link adjacent and easily accessible 
on the beach side 
price and breakfast are incredible value 
however they provide a free shuttle to tst ( although it is very cramped if you 're 
some of the best beaches 
to be honest they are both lovely hotels and you are spoiled for choice 
handy if you are visiting the university and if you are stuck for good accommodation otherwise might not be 
the hotel lobby was always very busy and seemed like grand central station most of the time 
and the front desk were wonderful in arranging this for us 
very good breakfast with lots of choices 
it is also a distance into town which means either a 45 minute walk or a 10-15 min 
but i prefer a bathroom door that closes completely 
seafacing hotel with warm bedroom and good views 
a very nice private beach is located just in front of the hotel 
high charge and a slow connection 
comfy large hotel rooms - great location right outside north side of train station ( you need to walk 
your average new sheraton 
spacious and cool temperature4 ) pool area 
not only is this a big inconvenience ( every time you want your car you have to wait ten minutes 
the deluxe king bed rooms are of a good size and beds comfortable with nice soft pillows 
the room was great though 
and is one of the nicer sheraton hotels i have stayed at - very new 
food at club lounge was very good with lots of options and variety 
rooms were clean but average 
this hotel is a very good option 
two bedroom apartment is quite spacious and well equipped 
here absolutely nothing . 
this is my second visit to this trendy hotel service wise it remains excellent and there restaurant is the main 
a trip to miyajima is a must 
the staff were exceptional as well 
overall not a bad stay 
the local train to get you to the miyajima ferry also leaves from that stationclub facilities 
excellent price for a good hotel 
service was first class - everyone was so helpful and the concierge team were very prompt in getting 
also the buffet breakfast has a good price ( us 20 ) and has everything you need ( including chicken 
the hotel is literally next to the train station which was easy to get access to 
adjacent to the main railway station and the terminus of the electric railway street cars 
for dinner or lunch and by boat or by kayak kanoo so you are not stucked in 
had a fantastic lunch at the thai restarant situated between veli and nadahlu 
i did n't like the outdoor bathroom much and there were a lot of mosquitos 
overall comfortable but dorm like 
there 's a giant tub with glass doors that open to the most breathtaking view of the ocean 
the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating 
i 'd probably pick a different hotel for another stay 
the plantation is a gem of an urban resort in the heart of phnom penh 
i would reconsider as there are plentiy of nice hotels in shanghai 
i didnt use the smaller red pool but the larger one with cabanas was excellent 
good water pressure 
an excellent option for staying in central phnom penh 
many of their staffs are rather friendly 
on arrival these were not available and i was moved to deluxe pool front rooms which where not adjoining 
nice rooms 
bright and good amenities 
i did however like the big pool but thats easy to find for less money and better treatment 
we stayed here for our first night in greece before flying to the islands the next day 
if we had been staying more than one night we would have kicked up a fuss about the room 
and had a small walk-out balcony 
it goes a long way to ensure that guest safety comes first 
the daily surprise of fruits and snacks were a great joy for our kids 
and despite its relatively small size 
very good breakfast with good quality food and fresh fruits 
restaurants and a nice pool with a view 
the hotel and camp grounds are similar to a large resort in a big us park 
so its worth to visit 
the executive lounge is also nice with a good selection of food in the evening and friendly staff 
so i paid extra to upgrade the two rooms i booked 
soft drinks 
ask for high floor facing the acropolis 
comfortable bed with pillow top mattress 
if you are a priority club member internet is free so that was convenient 
on the last two nights it smelled of fresh paint which ruined our appetite 
i stayed for one night at the hotel and was really amazing memorable stay starting from the bell guy at 
the beach was excellent and have own private hotel area for daybeds umbrella etc 
mini bar nothing free like other luxury resorts 
great restaurant and pool 
i stayed in athens for all august 2 weeks at this hotel great hotel great staff great service 
straight from the check in you know this is a true intercon 
keep to the lefthand side of the street 
i would suggest a hotel close to the beach 
newly renovated spacious rooms with every aminity you could require during your stay 
and the price differential ( i paid rs 6 
the bed was super comfortable and the sheets so wonderfully smooth 
it 's not a bad area and quite safe 
this property was really good 
room was large with two sofas 
a high floor has the best views 
i tried the gym and it had a large choice of machines 
overall though we felt the out of the way location was a small sacrifice compared to the very reasonable 
we were happy with our acropolis view and the bed was very comfortable 
apart from the absolutely amazing location 
the area is a bit out of the way of the centre ( not so far that it is impossible 
very much looked forward to staying at the ct but the overall upkeep and cleanliness really took alot 
but well some others were more friendly and the front manager ( i think ) even sent us sparkling wine 
- the roof top bar- music played on the rooftop bar- molton brown toiletries- big 
check out konoba didov san in the old town 
cool lobby 
corridors with thick carpets 
there was free wifi 
the breakfast was way better than most 
this superb hotel offers all - class 
restaurants and the beach 
room size was spacious 
tasty and with a very nice dining area 
it has lovely common areas 
with separate seating area 
the cathedral and old town are just about 10-15 minutes away 
the historical building is well maintained 
the location was great 
( and the price was very reasonable too ) 
breakfast and dinner were excellent and what was not on the buffet would be made to order 
quiet in the evenings and nice restaurants all nearby made this hotel a great place to stay 
i had read some fantastic reviews of the hotel and my expectations were in fact 
close to the beach small but comfortable rooms , pillow menu appreciated and cheap parking ! 
the water pressure was low as well which almost feels like i 'm standing under a running tap 
but plenty of options not too far away 
many restaurants nearby 
this is one of cape town 's and africa 's ( and surely the world 's 
higher floor have better views 
it is famous for its afternoon teas and the wealthy of ct still flock there daily to try 
it is ideally located above a shopping centre so once parked you can walk everywhere 
ian 's food was amazing and he was so nice 
the bed was on the firm side and the pillows were too soft 
it is in an original historic building 
what was meant to be a romantic getaway turned into a bit of a disappointing experience 
there is a free shuttle service to the waterfront and to camp 's bay and the hop-on 
the wifi signal is weak inside the bedroom 
- top notch afternoon tea 
the bed is very comfortable 
it was located in a small side building which was located 5 minutes from the main building and 10 minutes 
our luggage arrived early and they did not have the foresight to place it in our room 
and we were wonderfully assisted by elaina at the customer service desk - flawless service 
fantastic location at namba station and close to main shopping and dotombri eating district first 
the kids club looked amazing but again a long walk 
we found the hotel 's location to be perfect for exploring the delights of osaka 
rooms are sizeable - one of a few that can accommodate three in a room making it perfect for small 
due to the train station where you can take the train directly from the airport 
this is one hotel in japan where breakfast was average but at least the staff will not rush you 
the food court was functional and had a lot of variety , including an indian outlet . 
its location is really convenient 
better to stay in the original port area - wynn lisboa area where there is more 
but in my next visit to osaka i will strongly consider returning here 
the golf course is big enough to make up the other 3 sides the entire course on the eastern side 
you will have to take a long walk back y to the room wing to find out whether they are 
rooms at the swissotel is rather spacious even with an extra bed fitted in 
and since this is japan-- a heated toilet bowl seat with auto bidet options 
high floor non smoking 
very nice bed and linen 
with the huge offering of very nice hotels with excellent customer service like four seasons 
although difficult to comprehend ( due to 3 lines all connecting into namba in different sub stations ) 
the bed was very comfortable 
you would be thinking they 're are so rudethe casino is as usual noisy 
it is centrally located in town 
there is a nice dressing table and big wardrobe that will wow over ladies without fail 
but was happy with our stay nonetheless 
all the rooms are newly refurbished and the design are modern 
beautifully landscaped gardens surroundig 3 huge pools 
small bottles of complimentary bottles of water replenished each day when the room was cleaned 
like a real palace 
the bath towels had a beautiful subtle fragrance 
anyway i got my peace and quiet and easy walking to the marina 
the bathroom is a bit outdated and the rooms could do with some updating and modern features 
breakfast was included in our package and there was free wifi in all the suites 
the staff are pleasant and the overall impression was that everyone was trying hard to make this a first class 
this is an excellent hotel with huge space and facilities which include excellent shopping mall with small lake 
we took our one year old and the room has nothing prepared for kid 
snorkeling right off the beach was good with a lot to see 
easy to walk across to city of dreams 
living area was large with full lounge suite and 4 seat dining suite 
clean and spacious 
the beds were nice and comfy to sleep in 
the reception is located on the 6th floor so it is a bit unusual to get to but key 
shopping in outlets such as h&m is cheaper since the price is same as hkd 
i specially like the wide range of food choices in the food court and prices very reasonable 
they provided very delicious chocolates and fruit on the first night 
still very clean and no smell of smoke on the non smoking floor 
goods room was large with a great bathroom doorman was very friendly and welcomed guests decor of room 
the room was lux and lavish with all the trimmings 
we came to the venetian if for no other reason that to stay at the biggest casino in 
excellent working stay in ghangzhou hair salon at spa level impressive hotel from the welcome to the 
unfortunately the housekeeper did not seem to clean the toilet properly 
attentive staff ( karen ke ) remembered the food i had complimented on and asked whether 
we were directed to drop off our bags at luggage check and then checked in 
with newer hotels around 
but i was disappointed that i could not get late checkout 
was upgraded to the luxury rooms and the size was impressive 
the room service and housekeeping are also very slow to respond and the room service menu is not vast 
it has the best smile staff and wonderful drinks 
we stayed in this hotel for short vacation over the weekend 
the room we stayed is around 200 m2 
this is a great hotel - rooms are generously large 
who was the only one who remembered me from before and he did do his best to make the all 
it is nice property with easy access to shops 
oh and i realize this review may be out of step with similar ones for this property but i stand 
good sized room 
i noticed that the conrad was getting excellent reviews so decided to try it out for my 3- 
even the pools are pretty good 
yet wonderful foot treatment 
the attached mall is extensive with many shops and restaurants 
being the largest casino in the world makes it a little difficult navigating to your wing 
the room was clean and spacious 
from the front desk ladies 
excellent front desk 
the restaurant was good and we really enjoyed the dinner buffet which had a good selection of indian food 
the front desk staff were really friendly and helpful 
huge walk-in shower 
the rooms were very clean and the decor stylish to a high level 
the gym is huge with multiple weight and cardio machines and the pool area has 4 pools including a heated 
macau is mainly about shopping and gambling ( for the chinese coming from the mainland ) 
the breakfast was located some what away and looked a bit chaotic 
there are plenty of beautiful hotels in macao 
also nearby city of dreams where you can watch the famous the house of dancing water and good miche 
quick 10 min transfer to the conrad 
there are regular free shuttle buses from the ferry port to the hotel 
the pool area looked nice and having the shopping mall next door is a bonus 
the hotel was fully booked and had plenty of guests but each one was given personal attention 
swimming pool is nice but opening hours can be extended a little bit 
one normal and one suite i think 
in europe one usually chooses a marriott or spg as we american looking of consistency and 
we were attended to promptly upon our arrival via the complimentary shuttle from macau international airport in taip 
excellent cocktails 
while the location is brilliant 
the bed was very comfortable and the sleep level was superb - no noise 
for further distance metro station is around the corner 
i stay in nice hotels all over the world and this property is certainly one of the best 
it 's also the little things that differentiate the hotel - like wrapping your mobile phone charger cord and 
you are a great hotel you can give your guests at least one free small bottle of water per night 
the best thing about this hotel is the location 
the location ca n't be beat-- one block from sony center with the city 's largest 
i could think of would be to move front desk somewhere further away from where it is presently and increase 
just opposite the terminal 
a usual sheraton airport experience 
my only slightly negative comment is that the bed was too hard 
the location is quite central with easy access to public transport and many touristy locations within walking distance 
all staff were very professional and courteous 
convenient with good transport network 
the hotel was easy to work with in terms of a transfer from the train station ( and less than 
overall this is a decent 4-star hotel ( definitely not 5 stars ) 
breakfast was very nice and enjoyable with a large selection of hot and cold dishes and a view - 
the only drawback to this hotel was the bathroom as the modern rectangular toilet proved difficult to flush with the 
perfect for early am flights 
the hotel itself was clean and tidy and the staff friendly 
mini bar with reasonable prices and tea and coffee ( instant ) free in your room 
2 minutes from the main station 
this was an overall good pick 
concierge lounge excellent 
service is 5 star and the location is great 
location good - very close to main train station 
with heavy fabric curtains and patterned carpets 
however the stay ( 2 nights early june ) turned out to peaceful & incident free 
the executive lounge was very nice - with hot and cold food options including selections like beef stroganoff 
even the beds were super clean 
breakfast buffet is great and service is friendly and wonderful 
) there 's a welcome drink upon your arrival and there 's a complimentary cookie every afternoon which 
the deluxe suite on the 3rd floor and the premium suites will easily fit a family of 4 
particularly when you increased the hot water flow 
30 pm hot foodthe lounge is open from 6 am - midnight with water 
the hotel staff was great and their english speaking was tops 
a popular bar 
handy location 
there was no noise even though it is located on a busy road 
actually i think the toilet is as huge as the room 
with an early-ish flight to new york 
they have bicycles if you want to go on your own 
ask to be on the tarmac side for a nice view of the airport and the mountains 
big bath 
there ca n't be a better airport hotel 
rooms of impeccable cleanliness and sleek modern decor 
good for short training 
the staff friendly and efficient 
we went upstairs to a better restaurant with more comfortable seating but you had to buy their whole buffet breakfast 
very nice airport hotel super convenient into vancouver int'l 
your face at the sink will remind you of a black and white horror movie 
rooms very quiet given how close it is to tarmac and multi story car park . 
you can go up to the cool little rooftop bar with patio and watch ( and also hear 
very close to international arrivals and the domestic transfer hall 
it is a short walk to the light rail station so you can go into the city 
perfect for a one night stop in our trip to chinagot a suite with a small living room 
a great touch 
as it was at the front desk and the concierge 
we have previously rented a room for 6 hours between flights and last night i stayed there between a late 
we caught a train right outside the hotel 
there is also a free shuttle bus to cebu city that drives three times per day 
the master toilet had a huge bath tub and their free toiletries for guest use is by chopard 
and normally would n't stay at an airport hotel if i did n't had to 
features rooms and restaurants with good views of the beach and water sports facilities for you to enjoy during your 
best in cebu ! 
perfect option of need to stay near airport for early flight or transfer 
watch the breakfast - hot food may not be hot 
the staff deliver an outstanding level of friendliness and helpfulness 
so we got a 10 discount on direct online booking with the hotel 
the private beach 
in the morning we managed to use the gym which has excellent equipment as well 
the signage is not great at the terminal but it 's difficult to get lost as the hotel is 
wonderful shower and good internet and the three items of clothing laundered free ( for exec rooms 
arriving tired after a very long flight 
a walk to the gardens and with plenty of convenience stores nearby 
manager refuses to take any action . 
stayed at the hotel the night before an early international flight 
breakfast was good before a flight 
the rooms are tastefully appointed and decorated 
access to the sea was dreadful & the beach was not maintained 
the resort is like a village style and to get to the pools and dead sea there is a bit 
strong aircon and free wifi - and great view of planes taking off 
the resort is beautiful 
the facilites of the resort were excellent and i totally reccomend having a day at 
evening offer was free cocktails and snacks in the lobby - which was enough to constitute a light dinner 
rooms were of a decent size with nice big shower and separate bath 
and it was a good value when i first started going there 6 months ago 
very large bed with more pillows than one person could ever need 
great public spaces 
the hotel is only a short walk from orchard road 
staff very helpful 
wifi is fast and efficient 
unfortunatley you cannot open window for security reasons 
i forgot his name but he is the best hotel staff ( receptionists too ) i ever met in 
spacious and clean 
overall a good experience with well situated hotel and friendly staff 
i would recommend if you want to try a boutique hotel in good orchard road location 
and close to a lot of hot new restaurants 
i was given a very nice corner room on the 24th floor with access to the executive lounge on 
it was spacious and the layout was very modern and well-furnished 
the carpets were black and the walls were painted black 
they use their limited space very efficiently also 
with windows facing the street side 
the rooms are big enough 
in fact the room also came with free fast wifi and two items of free laundry a day 
afternoon drinks and snacks offered free of charge 
it 's just on a back street behind orchard road 
the hotel staff were friendly and helpful 
we had an issue with a lost toy at the end of the trip and liesbeth and the 
they do n't have twin bedded rooms - there is a comfortable double bed and a dreadful sofa 
overall a high quality hilton hotel and as good a business hilton hotel i have stayed in 
be prepared to wait a long time to collect your car 
this apartment is one of the best i have ever stayed in 
but brisbane seems to still be at a reasonable price point for good value 
the apartment had a full size fridge 
which is found in an adjacent street 
it was exactly as advertised with a breathtaking view across to the american falls through a large glass door 
the club lounge was great for snacks and tea 
the bed was very very comfortable 
the front desk is a disaster 
i used the gym on the 14th floor and where else could you workout in front of full sized 
utensils and kitchenware were all clean and off a good premium standard 
overall i find they would be better for long stays or families 
close to the river and a few nice cafes etc you could get ferry to the south bank area 
great view and excellent location 
the apartment was very clean and well furnished ( furniture looks new too ) 
convenience store next door 
the room was nice with a sofa fire place and beautiful views of the falls 
and while the rooms were nice 
as a long time spg platinum i spend a lot of nights in hotels 
not entirely the hotel 's fault resembling more like a theme park resort than city center sheratons 
rooms are a good size 
wall mounted hair dryer and fluffy bathrobe and indoor slipper 
bedroom was large and spacious with two double beds 
i prefer to have a seperate shower 
the hotel neglects its international guests which are from other countries 
this was a nice hotel 
the breakfast was standard and the fruit looked a bit old and not fresh 
the people at reception are most helpful and the whole place is trendy 
fairly good size 
breakfast was outstanding with plenty of fresh food and coffee 
and a nice rooftop pool area to cool off in our lounge 
great location as well next to central park 
the staff were friendly enough and the concierges are very helpful and booked resteraunts and provided 
for the money we paid we thought it great value too 
the staff very friendly and attentive to the children ( which they loved ) 
being a 2 minute walk from the duomo square - you can get around easily in milan 
breakfast was an excellent buffet with virtually everything you could ask for including fruit 
we had an enjoyable stay as it is so convenient to go around with shopping options available along orchard 
the room itself was modernised with a great work desk and comfortable bed 
cool lounge area for cocktails and a rooftop pool with views that is perfect for a proposal . 
within easy walking distance to shopping and restaurant areas and set overlooking lovely parklands 
the gym was great 
the swimming pool was adequate but was quite busy with childrens swimming lessons 
good curtains that keep out light 
but this hotel was such a nice surprise i would have liked to stay longer 
and the best restaurants in town are 5 minutes away 
breakfast is a must and i enjoyed the good quality food they served 
we had a lovely small balcony onto the street 
really good value for money 
i will choose hotel jen orchardgateway for my next visit to singapore 
a nice sitting area and second closet 
which are in the adjoining building just across from the hotel entrance 
no public access lifts 
there are some great little restaurants nearby as well 
55sqm of good use of space 
and the food was fine 
the building is magnificent and the property is very well maintained 
personal touch 
there is a lovely small jewellery shop with fair prices 
extra bed was already there 
we had two executive suites one overlooking venice 
the room is spacious 
the pool is a lap pool so if you have kids who envision major pool fun 
everything is good in this hotel 
the bathroom was great with a large shower cubicle and separate bath 
the bathroom was very spacious and well appointed 
so good aircon and facilities 
the fitness and the spa were very disappointing it is very very small 
very long time- when we opened the windows 
clean and the staff were great throughout 
sink and toilet and then a half bath with just a sink and toilet 
this however made the stay more interesting and it is not a problem to move about 
a lovely old style building 
it is also located near the water taxi spot , so trips elsewhere in venice or to the 
the exec lounge was ok - not as well stocked with drinks and snacks as many other hilton exec 
the hotel is considered one of the landmarks there 
and the rooms are all unique and the rooftop pool has great views 
the staff are very nice and very attentive and they get full marks 
the concierge was very helpful as was the rest of the staff 
and was great value for what we paid 
we did not eat in the hotel for lunch or dinner as we were touring venice 
very clean and tidy and nice furnishings 
there are restaurants and a great pub at your doorstep 
that gave us such an amazing price 
showers in baths were common making access difficult with bath height some 50 cm 
with the benefits of a full kitchen and dining room 
no pool but good gym 
spotless and modern with a balcony and partial city view 
the place is really just a conference center outside of rooms and a small casino that charges an entry fee 
i would walk up to one of the cafes in town next time 
the bathroom was clean and the shower was good 
good selection of breads and small selection of cheeses 
the internet was free 
the room was comfortable but , as we were visiting in a very warm period the absence of ac 
good storage space 
separate shower enclosure and separate toilet room 
the ambiance is very nice 
the hotel is very pretty and well situated near the beach with excellent beach service 
strong free wifi 
breakfast buffet has a huge variety including big choice of local cousins 
you will find all sorts of modern facilities here 
the hotel is large and sprawling and the hallways lined with beautiful timbers and decorated with antiques 
the champagne bar was very good with a great view over the water and i tohught the prices 
they did then call me to apologize and offer a free dessert 
location to one of the most amazing delicious dinners in sea-spray i have ever had 
toilet vanity area as well as the walk in wardrobe nicely designed and spacious 
with one of the best showers i 've used in an hotel 
did n't have a sea view but no matter as the common areas had great views 
fabulous fabulous views of darling harbour from our room on the 21st floor and the executive lounge on 
the french do luxury best and my experience in other sofitels confirms that 
this hotel offers old style grandeur at a competitive price 
the bed was nice and very comfy and the pillows great 
bathroom and makeup area ( very spacious ) and lastly kitchenette which is equipped with microwave 
they will also sent a tuktuk free of charge for you 
the outside bar excellent and the service is very fine 
the suites upgrade is nice 
the galle face is a beautiful property - lovely grounds with a magnificant ocean view and the perfect 
the gym is huge and a little dated 
the pool is beautiful as are the natural hotspring spas 
they were easily wiped off using a wet towel but really not expected at a st 
the ibis has one of the best value buffet breakfasts in australia and the food 
face the harbour if you can otherwise nothing to look at 
onto the road and back into the front desk 
i had walked past the ibis darling harbour a few times walking from the novotel so 
one of the best attributes for a western traveler is the good internet with few filters and good selection of 
very comfortable hotel with great staff and service 
i found the room to be of reasonable size and very clean 
the location was ideal in the diplomatic district 
ask for a room overlooking the strip and if you don t like long walks to your room ask for 
even new york new york where we went to see a show is much better from a casino 
one of the better located garages adjacent to the hotel and plenty of space 
the pool was amazing 
room had nice big bed 
we also had drinks in the bar one evening which offered a great selection of wines ( not common in 
we eat at the carvery buffet a couple of times and found it to be excellent value for money 
the mirage also hosts some of the best restaurants in vegas which kept us dining inside the hotel 
and comfortable bed & pillows 
the casino floor smelled of urine and even though the rooms all said no smoking when you walk through the 
it is really difficult to find a place for decent meals in the vicinity 
the lobby is gorgeous and we had a few meals and drinks in the restaurant that were great 
and had excellent sushi 
the decor was interesting in the room but might not suit everyone 's taste 
but we were unaware that smoking was still allowed at all inside the building ) 
several nice touch inside room 
the ground floor is occupied by the small lobby and the bar breakfast lunch foyer room 
we 've been to vegas a few times now and this is the nicest hotel 
a deli and bb king blue 's club besides the buffet and high end restaurants 
great staff 
security is high with the entrance accessible only via its own security checkpoint and there is a metal detector when 
good hotel to stay along the strip if you are not particular about the bathroom 
pleasant stay from the very beginning to the very end 
i had a room on a high floor with a great view of manila 
i had private transfers to and from ninoy aquino airport which was well worth it 
service is impeccable 
the hotel is located on many levels with the lobby area looking like it is on level 2 or 3 
a welcome fruit basket 
the hotel is centrally located at the green belt 
nice and spacious with good blackout curtains to help with remaining nocturnal 
the bathroom was large except the double doors did n't close completely ( definitely needed some adjustment ) 
good access to transportation and very safe to walk around 
thry have a great pool and bar outside as well as a top notch health club 
did n't have a good sleep as the noises from the street were quite loud 
bathroom was also a good size and well lit 
the mini suites offer comfortable and spacious accommodation whereas standard rooms are a bit on the small side 
this is a very pleasant hotel with friendly efficient staff and clean and comfortable rooms 
the only down side is a constant buzzing noise that reoccurs every five minutes or so that comes 
our room was a good size and we particularly enjoyed the access each evening to the club lounge 
the location close to newcastle beach and magnificent seaside walks is ideal 
it would be paradise ! 
nicely decorated 
love the fact that hilton can provide free wifi 
this hotel is up with a lot of good hotels 
makati is a beautiful area of manila 
its a bit difficult for the taxi guys to understand the location of this hotel as its a new 
it 's difficult to have a conversation in the bar or open communal spaces and the singer in the 
i am amazed with her high level of hospitality 
dirty carpets 
the front desk could not have been more accommodating 
not the type of service you expect from this label 
by the time we got to the front desk 
nice restaurants & shopping area including nanjing east road malls 
most beautiful hotel ever 
and have had a pleasant stay each time 
the shower was great and room size was big 
an extra large marble bathroom & a flat screen tv with numerous choices in english ( as well as choices 
amazing location & great hotel overall 
very high standards of service all around 
breakfast buffet is one of the very best ( like intercontinental in hong kong ) 
ca n't recommend this hotel highly enough 
i have been to hundreds of hotels worldwide and this was one of the best experiences i have ever had 
the river bund view would be worth to upgrade or pay for -- beautiful 
there is no question on the high quality and standard of this hotel in terms of accomodation 
the moment i entered the main lobby 
a true 5 star hotel indeed 
overall an excellent stay and would definately be back the next time in manila 
the beds are very comfortable and the rooms are of reasonable size and the wifi was good 
downstairs there are a number of in-house restaurants including a huge eat-all-you- 
the hotel is in a busy are so a higher room is quieter 
the swimming pool was a fair size and the pool area was very clean 
i will definitely stay here again 
excellent five star hotel with perfect bund location see if you can get a room with a view decided 
concierge plus one just shake their heads 
it was a warm winter day and the air conditioning thermostat could not lowered to below 26c 
the concierge recommended a great restaurant within walking distance for us to get duck- we would n 
the rooms are extremely well decorated and there are more amenities than one could dream of 
the staff were friendly and responsive but the best thing for me about the westin is the focus on 
electric curtains 
nice area 
service and good facilities then this is a great choice 
we arrived late from the airport and were tired and edgy due to the taxi from the airport 
a few minutes s-bahn away from the main station and half way to the airport 
the food is pretty good 
usual courtyard standards with great staff 
very nice hotel with great service 
the bed is comfortable and the bath shower and air conditioning are fine 
and a cool vibe that 's not off-putting or overly hip 
the bathrooms were similar to others in the same area which i did not enjoy 
i found the first room unsatisfactory it was small & had a dirty cleaning cloth sitting in the basin 
the interior is modern - although the design might perhaps be better served by a little more understatement 
the free shuttle to universal studio is great ( but do n't miss warner bros studios 
are also better than the norm with a good size pool and spa bath and gym 
good location with ample of attractions around to keep you busy 
very poor customer service 
then she disappeared out the back and brought what i think was the supervisor out to the front desk 
accommodation is fairly good and comfortable . 
i had a serious mishap during check-in ( was my own fault ) and the frontdes 
the bedrooms are comfortable and well equipped 
the so called fresh orange juice came for sure out of a pack and so on 
the windows open so you can enjoy the fresh air 
i was in an interior room and the noise from the place was very loud 
and when i needed a taxi one was available almost instantly outside 
it 's also great for business trip but i would not want to stay for personal vacation seeing all 
arrival was early but reception staff were excellent 
i do like the nice little quirky touches of the le meridien brand 
but have all the main amenities that you would expect 
but not super hip or exceptionally modern 
very small cabin with paper thin dividing walls to next cabin 
cruise ship small ) 
i visit this hotel a lot and as spg gold member i am surprise i never get upgrade or 
not great if you have an early flight 
but lacked that personal touch that can make a stay really special 
there are plenty of dining choices nearby and amlost always a taxi right outour room was a reasonable 
i have therefore seen my fair share of hotels across the globe 
avoid the harbour view rooms if you want a good night sleep 
close to wonderful restaurants 
there were no friendly smiles 
it is only a few minutes walk to metro station and more important the pedestrian street 
like the pool & spa 
you just have to get a cab and off you go to your meetings 
great views from the higher floors 
the hotel is extremely well located near restaurants 
second visit and a good choice 
the breakfast buffet is extensive and mostly excellent 
all rooms are well above the street but i choose a room on floor 40 or above for easy access 
insisting i pay an incorrect invoice and explaining to me the concept of a credit card guarantee at check 
pool area is nice and overall this would be a good choice for a family with 2 children 
which led to multiple lift changes for different floors 
a huge party held in another apartment on the same floor and secondly 
just exist at the people square station and as you come up to street level 
had an amazing welcome amenities in our room upon arrival ( thank you 
this hotel is ideally located across from the massive mall just over the border from hong kong 
the beds were great with luxury linens 
you ca n't have a proper shower as you feel the water temperature changes back and forth every few 
with a good writing desk & chair that could be used for work 
but the meriton tower is a great landmark 
the location is exceptional as its directly down the street the roma street station and a short walk to 
and i could hear music from a nearby nightclub at night - the management were unable to fix the window 
it is not the shangrila you would find in other parts of the world 
corner room on 16th floor with wonderful views of downtown and mountain ranges 
there are better hotels around 
so now my only options was dusty water for 4 
we were also able to enjoy the rooftop restaurant for dinner one night 
as we got a good rate to stay here 
it 's incredibly easy to access from the luohu border check ( seriously 
the room was very 
when i checked the online rate on the hotel 's official website again 
the hotel itself if beautiful 
a super hotel with warm and friendly staff and located close to pretty much everything in the heart of str 
the only down side is it is a bit hard to find 
i also thought that for a hotel drinks and food prices were reasonable 
there were 2 check in desks for regular guests and one for spg members 
the gym is a little old but has everything you need 
we last visited this hotel in november 2008 and i rated it highly then 
it was a short walk to the main part of town 
stuffy ( you will leave smelling like eggs and bacon ) 
it 's about a 15-20 minute walk to the canal where there are lots of restaurants for 
the lobby was simple in design but really chic and scandinavian-ikea-ish in 
so it has the latest in bathroom & bedroom 
spacious bathroom 
the beds were comfy and the large bathroom was a plus 
plus the addition of the roof top pool and resto bar 
the parking in hotel meant that business guests could get easy access to hotel 
good internet access 
breakfast and snacks available all day 
very nice boutique hotel but 
perhaps the bathroom is a bit too old 
i 'd recommend as little time as possible here ( although the large mosque is impressive ) 
the drinks were so much more expensive than other hotels in the country ( the same drink is about 20 
we had a beautiful villa next to the pool 
the location is extremely central and near the square where they have the astronomical clock 
prague was a beautiful city and the buddha bar hotel was a great choice mainly for the 
basically just an official airport shuttle to the north railway station and the subway to the bell tower 
we stayed for only one night with family couples and it was terrific 
the decor is a bit of an assault on the senses and you will either love it or hate it 
ask for higher floors 
one of the bath towels had a hole in it and the interior designer of the bathroom must have spent 
so comfortable for a business trip 
because it 's near the station and near one of the most fun neighbourhoods 
so combined with what i felt was the low quality of the rooms along with the omnipresent chaos at 
( only limited parking available at the hotel - first in 
a walk in the direction of the central station takes you through the main district and a short ride on 
the main building decor is beautiful and thats where i thought i was staying but theres a different wing 
the amenities provided are great as well 
-1 ) the resort is a long way from anywhere 
spectacular apartments and superb service in a relaxing oasis 
its a short walk from the asia jaya train stop although getting there during peak hours is a 
the pool had a decent view though was a bit small personally for my tastes 
have to pay . 
beautiful artwork 
is of decent size but appears dimmed and enclosed without much natural light at all 
it was nice to see that the hotel kept bathtubs as these things seem a thing of the 
the usual hilton standard that make u feel like home 
in this cabin you place your laundry 
the breakfast buffet is excellent though 
with easy access to the federal highway that links kuala lumpur with shah alam 
the front desk was very accommodating 
the hotel lobby was beautiful and the breakfast was amazing ( great view of central park to go with my 
the suite was definitely spacious 
but the location on the southwest corner of central park in addition to lincoln center 's proximity summarizes 
our suite had great views and a comfy bed 
the main lobby is not the biggest of all lobbies but is spacious enough with some very interesting art 
very strange layout - lobby is a long skinny corridor which gets jam up with people 
with amazing view of central park 
the bathroom had a full shower and a wonderful soaking tub 
one of my favourite hotels ever 
for nyc it is pretty good . 
yes i am sure there is better value in the city for those in the know 
not sure about others but the higher floors give you a good view of the lake and a birds eye 
get higher floors 
non alcoholic drinks and snacks from the snack bar were complimentary 
great location for work and rooms smallish but all new and clean 
) the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a nice giant spa bath 
these two functionally discordant entities do make strange bedfellows 
room was also excellent and had efficient quiet air conditioning 
instead of leaving at that moment and with no apology he told me i need to check your mini bar 
a nice mall mrt station is very near by 
low quality plastic or 
a taxi is around 35 
not to worry though as the friendly staff had us checked into another room quickly 
it is great to have a large bathroom with a separate bath 
i was greeted with a lovely welcome drink and hot towel which was most welcomed after a long flight 
the hotel lobby bar looks nice 
needs to have more seats during the 10am peak period and the water 
crisp sheets 
the hotel is at the river and close to the shopping street rundle mall 
club facilities were good 
a small and refreshing welcome drink was offered 
( the outside windows were perhaps last cleaned then as well ) room had a stained carpet ( see picture 
this is one of the iconic green mark building in singapore which has appeared on the media before 
service ok ( some confusion at the check in due to procedures seemingly more complicated than usual ) 
a room with executive lounge privileges is worth it 
some good shopping is available with a short 5 minute walk over to rumbly mall 
the whole decor of the hotel is quite amazing 
it appears that these are standard type rooms with just access to some extra benefits like the 16th floor 
but my checkin was swift friendly and rather jovial 
but fresh pancakes can be ordered 
the breakfast buffet also had a good spread of variety and choices to choose from to satisfy one 's 
the large glass window allows natural lighting into the room 
it also has an infinity pool with great views of the city centre 
the room was kept cleans tidy and the self-serve drinks policy of the club lounge was very 
the bed was exceptionally comfortable and the internet was quite fast 
i had a great room on a high floor 
walking distance from major shops 
i particularly liked that they featured a wide range of gryphon teas and espresso-based 
rooms are spacious and clean 
balcony on 34th floor was good but raining most of time so didnt go out 
would be a nice touch 
the rooms have excellent views over the city or the new cricket ground etc 
the bed was too firm for my liking and the wifi was very slow which was unforgivable considering 
altogether makes up for a really nice breakfast experience 
the hotel is on a quiet street area and right near tons of shops and restaurants 
our last visit we stayed on the executive floors - most comfortable 
do n't book a corner suite if you like watching tv in bed as the tv is in an 
expect long queues 
great bathrooms-its modern and boutique like but with the professionalism f a hyattthe next door 
one of the best hotels in singapore i have stayed excellent location within a shopping mall and close to 
the high speed internet was ridiculously slow 
room deco and service a pretty much the same as as the old time - which my colleague said 
the property is located conveniently in the center of napa 
our next visit to singapore is scheduled for august 2014 and we will definitely be rebooking 
overall great value for money and we would stay here again 
although there are restaurants nearby 
the rooms are large and i like the location by the water and close enough to shopping i 've 
the pool which both hotels share is worth a visit also 
a hard to find good value hotel option in singapore 
windsor itself had a party & the roftop was open for guests so we had a 
the buffet breakfast was also excellent 
or an elegant shopping mall right next door 
we stayed 3 nights in an incredibly spacious 2 bed apartment the apartment was well appointed and made for a 
as is the plasma tv - there is even a channel that shows a view of the harbour so you 
both their western and asian food were delicious 
great location - comfy 
there was a cupboard full of glasses with signage strewn about saying do n't use ( see 
centrally located and close to many good restaurants 
room was a good size 
kettle & 2 complimentary bottles of water each day 
but paying almost 150usd for a bathroom sink with no hot water 
rooms are large and very spacious even for 3 persons 
located above shopping mall and city hall mrt ( train ) 
the following day i went back to the front desk to ask everything was cleared up to which the reception 
all staff helpful & friendly & restaurant breakfast plentiful & varied 
but dont expect quality 
more importantly , i got a feel of lacking of luxury elements required to today 's accommodation . 
beautiful suites with huge 
spite the hotel being large and busy the efficiency at checking was superb 
there are lots of little cafes all around the hotel that are far more relaxing 
they quickly provided a foam one 
a good start at reception with an efficient 
there are lovely restaurants and shops around the area 
we were up pretty high with a view over the shared pool ( with the fairmount ) 
the hotel is fine - but a bit tired - could do with being modernised 
the hotel is well located between two shopping centres and close to the mrt 
the location was great - the hotel is in south yarra - the area is packed with cool 
i had called for a taxi through the concierge and they gave me this sheet of paper with 
they give you access to a courtesy lounge ( a room with shower ) which is good 
its centrally located and has a mrt station right next to it 
i enjoyed hotel but was n't at the hospitality standards of tokyo conrad hotel--not 
it is a super beautiful resort 
the carpet at one particular point was always wet 
although the hotspring area is a bit small 
the third thing is the bedroom was spacious although the furnitures looks very old 
this was an excellent gorgeous resort 
le tran the manager and anh ngo were always there to greet us with a warm and 
the resort is an integrated one 
i personally came away with the feeling that in many areas the first priority for the resort is making money 
the staff were friendly at reception and the restaurant 
i like this place & suggest that you focus on the positive reviews that have been written 
plenty of daily activities plus one of the best island golf courses is a plus 
choose higher floors for great views 
the lounge on the next floor was first class 
it is not one full bed 
nevertheless the service was good 
i was told it 's right above subway station 
but everything they had was really good quality 
bars and restaurants specially rooftop bar is a must visit when in singapore 
got the room at 99 euros per nite and it had a basic facility of what you come to 
but not the very modern luxury 
club rooms are larger and higher up plus you get all the extras that go with it 
the internet was fast enough to work 
clean beds 
we also a small balcony to look out onto with nice views 
it us beautiful hotel with nicely kept grounds 
the bed was a little firm but it was a very comfortable room to come back and relax from the 
the rooms are large and clean and well equipped 
overall nice but i will look for a more boutique experience around the old city next time 
concierge was outstanding as well as the front desk staff 
very nice hotel bang opposite the terminal 
i was greeted by a lady and an ipad checkin which was quick and easy 
piping hot soup of the day ( good ) and a club sandwich ( poor ) 
there is no way i 'd recommend this property and you are better off spending your hard earn money 
arguably the best international standard 5 star accommodation in cuba 
but they should work out a covered walkway to the hotel 
since we brought our own toiletries thus did not use the hotels supplied toiletries 
the lobby is lovely and reflective of the colonial era 
the hotel is in a safe area and extremely convenient for all the sights and the hop on and hop 
family room with a double bed and two sofa beds for the kids which they loved 
staff were excellent and the bar manager also had a great present 
breakfast at this hotel is excellent and it is a great place to stay in cuba 
the first answer in this beautifully located hotel is always 
many different juices 
so in terms of shopping and eating at qbm 
with the guest relations manager proactively contacting me to apologise and offer a bottle of havana club reserve 
the roof top pool terrace gave good views over havana 
just walking right outside the hoel we were right in old havan witht the museums 
utmost helpful concierge assistance 
the breakfast buffet is very very good 
breakfast buffet but also a la carte was truly exceptional in terms of quality and freshness 
two good rooftop pools but suffer from 'german practice' of reserved but unoccupied sunbeds 
it is an expensive hotel but it worth it 
they have 2 nice restaurants 
the entry hall and walk-in closet were huge which made the actual bedroom space small for such a 
everyone from the doormen to the concierge to the bar and restaurant staff were pleasant but 
get a courtyard room and you can sleep with the window open and hear only silence 
spotless and comfortable with all the normal facilities 
its handy for restaurants and shopping and the main sights of the city 
this is a nice historic hotel in a decent location with lots of charm 
the familiar white stripe duvets in place 
rooms are a good size 
lounge and conference rooms were nice 
very busy lobby 
we picked the hotel because we wanted a historic property with bright 
goes without saying that the spa is also amazing 
especially the coffee and the staff was friendly at all times 
my only two issues are that i do n't feel that the bathroom amenities reflect the quality of the 
the gym is small but serviceable as long as there are n't more than 4 people in it 
walk across the street you will find the museo de prado 
the service is terrible and i would not waste my time or money staying here until they renovatei 
it 's a real palace 
the bed was amazing 
great location and worth the price 
the room i booked was the harbour junior suite which is around 35 sqm large in the upper floor 
i understand some of the outer rooms are quite noisy so we had no complaints 
it 's a very good hotel for mongkok area 
if you want to feel like your in hong kong this is a great place to stay 
opulently decorated and spacious rooms 
the bar in the lobby is staffed by several really good guys 
we found the room well appointed and the facilities in the hotel were of a high standard 
separate shower area too with a sliding door 
october was a great time to visit 
we were walked down in to the station across the road and shown how to buy tickets and where to 
comfortable bedding etc 
the complimentary tea and coffee offered is brought very promptly 
madrid is a lovely city 
jennifer at spg front desk 
the service good and the prices reasonable for this level of establishment 
the helpfullness of the front desk staff 
location is just perfect and close to everything 
clean and friendly staff 
perfect location nearby museums and main train station 
even its abit old looking but it was terrificly design ahead of its time 
perfect fir the first time visitor to kl with great views out to petronas tws 
the bed is excellent 
room service menu continental breakfast is 30 euros 
the location is extremely convenient for museums and the sol tourist area 
tired old hotel 
very happy with our staythe good 
door locks were poorly maintain and we all really struggled to get in and out of the bathroom every single 
yes there is free wi-fi in the lobby and bar but i do n't want to sk 
my room was quite a good size 
the staff were outstanding in professionalism and helpfulness 
had a great pool and day spa 
the wi fi is a bit 'hit-and-miss' and there are wonderful restaurants in the 
bathroom spacious and clean at all times with more than adequate lighting 
we also had drinks and snacks at the hotel bar 
d degree ) btw additional usefully feature is tourist tour double decker which has regular stop nearby 
the result - a brand new luxury hotel with no guests 
i especially liked the matress and the blanket 
but it was all about high quality and attention to detail in everything they did 
when i double checked at the counter they insisted it was an executive room 
before considering that our rate included plaza club benefits ( full buffet breakfast for two daily 
athmosphere is quite nice and the lobby is quite impressive 
this left the room with a damp feeling 
located centrally the hotel is like an oasis with great facilities 
this was part of a 4 week trip and the room was one of the best we had 
i feel that soi 18 's room is not as big as soi 16 but they have 
many rooms have angular windows that jut outside the building acting like a picture frame of the city 
mark the conciege was very helpfull and managed to get us algatraz tickets when all had 
the food is really good too 
the hotel offers you a softdrink in the bar 
a free mini-bar for soft drinks and water 
it is relatively small ( 5 floors of around 9 rooms per floor ) and is a modern boutique hotel 
mobility passes are included giving free travel on public transport which is a great addition 
it was nice to see free valet parking 
the rooms are large and comfortable 
beds were comfortable and bedding was fine 
bathroom as usual with a lot of hotels was small but adequate 
pm stores next to hotel 
very basic toiletries 
pool attendants were super friendly and helpful 
decent size 
a few blocks from the white house and close to the metro at farragut square 
the hotel offers a free shuttle from terminal 3 which was handy and the room rates are not as outrageous 
we were assigned room 850 - same floor as the lounge 
which is quite small for its price 
a large badroom should have a nice barhtub but like elsewhere they remove bathtubs for 
the public areas are small 
this is a nice hotel with good facilities but the quality of the rooms etc 
the loung serves excellent cocktails and the lobby opens to a garden by the sea 
all the right touches and variety 
with plastic beds and chairs 
s . 
mine had a large bathtub shower cabinet 2 sinks 
hotel has very large long corridorswe had executive room in glass extension clean and comfortable bedroom spacious separate 
whilst a nice hotel my latest day was n't as special 
breakfast buffet was very good 
great spa 
so i get free wifi and can choose the room a day before arrival 
tv options were limited and no robe or slippers 
the chefs are so sure of their preparation that they would not even add an extra gravy if it dist 
bed was a small king with nice bedding 
service is slow and the food at the indian restaurant very average 
this is a nice corner room 
the property 's high point is the roof top bar which is quite happening 
comfortable airport hotel 
i slept ok but the wifi is expensive the service lacking energy and commitment 
but the quality in the hotel 
amazing views of mumbai skyline and the sea 
which are a good walk away 
in the toilet- would be a lot more convenient to have the dnd and housekeeping switches next 
room itself was standard four seasons quality with all the usual amenities one would expect 
thick towels in the bathroom and kettle with coffee tea making facilities besides several other 'complimentaries 
well fitted out with a small patio area and spacious 
fantastic rooms in this great location 
breakfast was really nice and overall i had a great stay 
they also have a good bar and restaurant at the lobby level and down there you also find a small 
in terms of facilities there is a huge gym 
first choice for every purpose . 
we loved this location and service was to the fairmont standard . 
we usually stay in a different hotel when overnighting in gatwick but chose to try hilton 
ask for a lake view on the second floor or if you budget permits 
with beautiful rooms looking to the leman lake and the alps 
the service really let the place down and could have been better 
i asked the front of house manager if there was anything better and he said that was the best 
house guests are provided with a free montreux transport card for unlimited travel bus train boat ( at 
the decor was classy and we loved the molton brown toiletries 
you should allow guests exit first 
i also heard the club lounge food & drinks were great 
quality of sleep disturbed by usual airport hotel noise levels during early hours 
the walls are super thin and you can hear people talking in the adjacent rooms 
the hilton club floor is ok but have stayed at a lot better club floor hotels 
very large bath and separate shower 
convenient located in the heart of tian he with the latest up market shopping mall right next to 
one desert and two small wines cost more than our room price 
this is an older property that has been kept in decent shape 
this is the most convenient hotel connected to the south terminal plus it 's everything you would expect from 
the bed was comfortable and the room was very clean 
the evening snacks were nice as well as the choice of drinks 
the hotel has a great laundry located near the spa 
no mini bar 
it 's also walking distance to the cheesecake factory which we enjoyed . 
it is worth booking in advance to get a reasonable rate 
all a bit of a pain in you are dragging your luggage along 
the hotel is very comfortable and the service excellent 
what should be an adults only space 
small bathroom but good that basin is separate to shower toilet 
why offer free internet for all guests if you are not able to provide a service that actually is usable 
generally the price is reasonable for the level of accommodations and the walk to the disneyland resort 
the bathroom ( without sink ) was rather small and old - in need of urgent renovation 
particularly around the pool were very good 
the hotel concept is a resort style but with smart stay look 
the pool is very nice and large but you can easily pick the tiles off which we saw many children 
we stayed here for 6 nights and had a great time in washington 
they have made a small beach too by the pool side 
the hotel is beautiful and the room we had 
relax in the outside and heated swimming pool 
my suite had a huge living room 
the shoreham has a great history of over 80 years but in addition to the grand reception and meeting 
a little pricey though 
the bedding was comfortable and the air conditioning welcoming in the warm barcelona climate 
also the k lsch beer was amazing at the bar 
comfortable bed and immaculately clean room and bathroom 
good toiletries 
all my colleagues agreed - the beds feel like you are sleeping on clouds 
we got a great rate for a junior suite and the room was really nice 
french doors separated the bedroom from the living room 
the shower flooded and the usual gripe the noisy doors to every room slamming 
the bathroom was equally pleasant a large seperate shower and great toiletries 
and not far from great little bars and restaurants 
i called the front desk to ask for the rollaway and was first challenged on the waved fee 
this hotel is absolutely fantastic 
3 ) the staff are friendly and very helpful and 3 ) the buffet spread is good and plentiful 
when i checked on the internet about the higher category room was available we challanged them about the story 
the bar is a bit pricey but there are so many bars within walking distance that you do n't 
the new room was smoke free but next morning when i went to get a bottle of water from the 
it has been transformed into a combination of traditional charm and contemporary chic 
rooms are very spacious with extremely comfortable beds and very high quality additions 
a key for me when travelling on business is a comfortable bed and these were excellent 
this is the best value 
service was terrific and beds were comfy 
i found that the two times i drawed a bath the water never really got hot enough . 
stayed in this hotel for a short break and can say it is located in very convenient location in 
there are plenty of restaurants 
we had planned to stay 2 nights but ended up staying only one because of a flight cancellation 
which was very spacious and nicely decorated 
but it 's a nice touch 
stayed 5 nights in a poolside deluxe room 
the pool itself was nice but the rooms looked worn already 
we had dinner one night with a show 
just stating the obvious without adding value this is a telephone 
the suite was huge and comfortable 
the breakfast buffet is free for kids below 12yrs old 
very good food 
weird stationary amenities ( scissors 
the reception is truly helpful and the hotel grounds are a delight 
the bathroom is huge and the toilet area is in its own section 
good facilities 
however an easy city to walk around 
a wonderful city and a very nice hotel 
the rooms a very spacious and well appointed 
rooms are well appointed and include amenities you 'd expect in a nice hotel 
000 feet ) so it gets cool during the late night and early mornings 
the oasia or another in the same area 
the shower also leaks for a few minutes after it 's been turned off so if you 're 
our floor had an ice dispenser located just outside the lift 
the only downside for this hotel would be the entry and exit from the reception to the main lounge area 
the room is pretty small compared to other 4 stars hotels nearby 
the game park had a lot of animals in number and we counted 26 different types of animals and birds 
small eateries like mos burger 
breakfast and salad bar really attractive but the dessert buffet probably unsurpassed in tanzania 
the reception was quick to check me in as it was already late in the evening 
we chose the hotel due to its proximity to the airport - we had an early morning flight 
rooms are of decent size 
my visit to the hotel started with the free shuttle from the airport before an excellent check-in experience 
nice health club - great pool area 
rooms have very thin walls and housekeeping starts early in the morning with the sound of vacuum cleaner that 
set in sprawling grounds and good internet free 
chinese restaurant for dinner completely different staff and was optimal in service 
the hotel has a nice swimming pool 
a great view back to the city over the bay and marina 
the beds were comfortable and bathroom was nice with large shower 
the property has some modern features to it 
i read all the bad reviews before i booked but thought i could work around the problems where to start 
our third stay should have been on our return from bhutan & we left a case in 
it is an ideal hotel 
limited lcd tv channels 
overall this is an excellent hotel with some outstanding features 
bar area is dismal but outside the reception is a good sitting area which would be better if the taxi 
i was impressed that i would be able to check in on your phone 
when we have a flight to europe late afternoon or a early us flight we always stay at the 
meals and snacks were first class and the banquet meeting staff hands on 
and having come from japan where overpouring drinks is a sign of good hospitality 
this is as fine an airport hotel as i can recall anywhere in the world 
the flush on the toilet is rather odd as it has a half-flush and normal flush feature like 
my room on the 6th floor was nice 
which owns the hotel and parking areas 
on the same floor is a quiet lounge area with bar and take the next floor to a louder bar 
even if our dishes had n't turned cold by then 
the ambience is great 
in fact everywhere was much more expensive than when i last visited 
why would i want to come early if my early checkin request is not confirm ? 
three items of clothing went missing when they found them it took me 40 minutes to find an english 
bathroom amenities are plenty with large bathtub 
we were in a room on the 8th floor and there was a smell in the room 
easy walk to anywhere 
the bed was nice and big 
very good hotel 
the westin singapore has a great location 
one thing i did struggle with was the number of lights in the bedroom - i found great difficulty is 
the pool area and the view was tremendous 
the cab is a long wait 
the bath room is also quite old fasioned with round lights bulbs around the mirrow - like 
some vegetarian dishes were not replenished at all 
) was very professional in explaining the parking charges and their process since they utilizes the office building 's 
the selection was great and the dining call was very elegant 
make sure your taxi driver knows where he is going 
modern and clean with 2 huge windows 
the hotel is extremely good and one would like to stay there for a week or more without even going 
the bed was you amazing heavenly bed you would expect from westin 
we enjoyed the usual amenities and the heavenly products from westin 
there is a great little italian tratorria on the side street next to the hotel which dishes 
good restaurants nearby 
quite astounded by the quality of the hotel in singapore 
it is one of the best given the line up of old hotels and this in contrast being a new 
rooms were modern and beds were comfortable 
the only downsize is the spa has no waiting room so you are sort of loitering around 
singapore has some amazing hotels 
very safe area 
definitely not a 5 star hotel lobby 
the bathroom is sizeable with a good shower 
awful again last time company paid for the room and have a special rate at this hotel so i 
the hotel rooms are great with nice design touches and great comfort as is expected from a 4 star hotel 
where you can get good public transportation via light rail subway into the center of kl 
saxon gardens and university as the hotel is located on the royal route 
handy for those with early flights 
you need a car to get to any other restaurants ( the hotel does n't have one ) 
t'was nice to come back to this airport hotel and find that the beds are much more comfortable 
we did n't take the offer up and were happy that we did n't as we discovered that 
happy hour at the pool bar being most pleasant 
the a c is stubbornly set at low temperature 
the bar was elegant and i wish i had more opportunity to try out all the amenities at this great 
the central bar is a must 
shower over a bath rather than separate shower cubicle 
everything was just very nicely decorated 
superb room with great floor to ceiling urban views 
very good buffet breakfast - where you can sit in a pleasant internal courtyard - plus universally friendly service get 
the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were nice 
always appreciate when i do and the larger room was a nice plus 
an extraordinary team never seen such a good one 
there are good restaurants in the area so you do n't need to travel back to the city wall 
spectacular lobby 
one has to wonder why the sofitel accepted the booking of the prime minister and the ambassador 
dramatic and exciting lobby areas and sensible food options 
ok restaurants and good fitness centre 
clean reception 
rooms are very well equipped and well maintained 
large and busy hotel 
also nice rooms and nice interior 
ordered room service as i was too tired to eat out in one of the many tempting restaurants near by 
our room came with access to the 15th floor lounge with afternoon tea and an excellent evening drinks and 
with wooden floors and large bathrooms with power showers and sumptuous toiletries 
they are small with no real natural light or curtains 
good sized rooms at reasonable price with desk 
normal hotel in a good place 
about 60 percent of the hotel 's guests are now mainland chinese who can be a bit loud 
being new to the area 
aside from the beautiful surrounding and comfortable room 
the hotel has several restaurants on property and we ended up having lunch at one of them 
complaints were met with a smile and shrugged off with a 'we 'll do better next visit 
no real problem for me but this has been reflected in other reviews- some of the front desk staff 
breakfast buffet is very good and good opportunity to try lots of scottish items ( hagg 
large bathroom 
however could be a good 30-min walk to downtown area 
the room is reasonable otherwise but looks its age 
a separate table and plenty of storage space ( although no drawers ) 
clean and overall a decent spot to spend some time in kyoto 
this crown plaza was a much older property in comparison to the one in hiroshima 
upgrade to a better view room in the same category is supposed to be natural 
the hilton would not recognize your stay and you are not entitled to free internet 
the hotel assistant-manager informed me that after my stay they will be starting to hand out as much 
superb location sensational pool area and walking to disney springs 
with some additional amenities 
this marriott must have a great training program - the results clearly show 
would have been better if the lounge was open during the weekends 
excellent facilities 
yet adequate buffet - we were informed that if we wanted a full breakfast selection 
bed was very comfortable and a huge bathroom was brilliant 
the indoor pool and fitness room were great additions which we used during our stay 
a very popular hotel for tourists and businessmen and a very very good holiday inn 
would recommend staying here if in a big group or family of 4 becoz rooms are large and beds 
couple of years back ) and returned here for the amazing overall quality the hotel offers 
i usually stay at the intercontinental but decided to change this timebooked a executive floor room and 
gee that king bed room you requested is n't available 
rooms were spacious and clean 
we were suggested to transfer to this hotel due to hotel continental was surrounded by marchers in bkk 
i 'm staying one night later in the week with my family at the gaylord before flying to 
stayed there for one night last week and found this property to be very jaded 
) i must highlight the room service 
price was actually a little high but the same food items will cost you 30 more via room service and 
pleasant gym and spa facilities and very friendly and helpful staff 
but it wears off quicklygetting around is time consuming as this place is hugevery small pool area 
when i say that it is a large property 
stayed here for a conference and the experience was decent overall 
and if you choose in the city centre like sukhomvit and silom 
enjoy the hospitality and the environment 
everything looks new being cocooned in an old building 
i have n't had any massages in the hotel itself but just across the road behind the hotel 
the lounge is open till 11 
every time we left the hotel main entrance the doorman was asking where are you going 
from other reviews ( though ) it appears as though the breakfast is good 
i had a room on a very high floor 
) i was a little disappointed and astonished by the person handling the taxis out front at our departure whom 
room was quite spacious and like all sofitel 's 
breakfast is good with a good spread of east and west cuisine 
however taxi 's during peak times refuse to drop you back at the hotel if you say visit 
i loved the new decor and the bathroom especially 
the club lounge was comfortable and well stocked 
the bed is amazing 
there is easy accessiblity to the skytrain and hence most tourist locationswe stayed in deluxe 
the pool and jacuzzi 's good 
very old furnishings 
well decorated and clean 
it was rectified but interestingly we faced the same problem in drainage of other room 's bathroom next 
i also enjoyed the pool dining and the level of professionalism from the staff 
the bathrooms are tinythe shower pressure was poorno complimentary water in the rooms 
the hotel itself has nice facilities 
with service and amenities top notch 
the outdoor pool and gym facilities are excellent 
superior is just as good sized 
the staff are friendly and helpful ( with one noted exception ) and the soon to be completed refurbishment 
it realy serves its purpuse as a airport hotel 
it 's an easy walk from arrivals 
the furnishings are good 
stayed here for 2 nights in early november 
choose the luxury club rooms to make your stay even more special 
especially when it gets busy and they loose whatever little manners they had to start with 
but fine in the hotel lobby 
the resort is all the way south in a very secluded area and any ride to nusa d 
the chef specialy of lobster omelette is divine 
the sky high prices dominate the wine list 
this is a five star hotel in all respects but it also has the added benefit of being in a 
the f&b options are limited if you compare with the likes of intercontinental or other major resorts 
in the middle of the best area of melbourne 
super private villa with a view 
the bed was very soft maybe too soft 
so we again called the front desk 
i am a accor platinum member so receive access to the accor 5 star hotels cub loung 
good privacy from most ( but not all villas ) 
the chef prepares a few highlights' each day 
sofitel is one of the few genuinely international standard hotels in melbourne 
including delivering your luggage to your room and friendly room service 
great views from high floors 
most hotels now offer complimentary in-room wifi and the sofitel should rethink its policy 
this hotel is amazing 
and this is my second review ( 1st one in 2015 ) 
would have preferred a separate shower than one over the bath 
shower head kept spitting water from the top and came apart twice during shower-most uncomfortable shower ever 
as one would expect in a hotel of this standard 
very good value 
karin at front desk was very effective to make up for this failure 
well worth a visit if you are here before the show ends in mind june 
i only stayed 1 night so will suggest to read as many newer reviews as the become available 
very easy apartments to have youngsters in as more than enough space to find a quite spot 
one more reason would be to admire the beauty of the pool and the indoor jacuzzi 
this property aims to attract and make happy the average gambler . 
and with several access into the hotel 
- high secured hotel 
it 's located close to anchorage main mall and shopping center 
i have often experienced such a lack of attention to this detail in hotels with large groups coming and going 
there are also several restaurants on site ranging from high class to pub food 
beautiful beachfront property with decent resort dining prices ( expensive for vietnam 
spacious bath 
we had a wonderful vegetarian breakfast in one of the local cafe just around the hotel 
the team in the restaurant went off menu and mad a most enjoyable meal with the ingredients available 
the beach in front of the hotel has plenty of sands to play 
the rooms were very clean and nice 
we had a huge unit with an excellent kitchen and spectacular views of the beach 
checking out is standard previledge of gold member of this hotel chain ) as our flight was schedule 
along the 'canal waterway' to the children pool which is a more popular area when we 
the property is beautiful 
check-in was quick despite being extremely busy due to several conferences and seminars taking place 
thank you for a great hospitality 
took about 15 mins to get checked in and the same was true at check out time 
are particuarly good for this standard of hotel 
and the beds comfortable ( with a pillow menu 
there is a good swimming pool in situ but the water was very cold 
the bed was extremely good 
the reception staff were very friendly and helpful even though they were very busy 
the airport buses and the city buses stop outside and are cheap 
the rooms were nice 
only reason i do not give the hotel 5 stars is because lack of free wifi at least there could 
the location is perfect for walking to most museums 
clean and modern rooms 
rooms are pretty average - clean 
if you look their lobby on web it is nice but right from bell man to staff are no customer 
public areas were gorgeous and the food we had at the wedding we attended was phenomenal 
the room at first glance was clean but either the previous occupant or the maid had long black hair as 
i think they are in for renovation next year 
very spacious and clean 
first stay in wellington and the novotel was everything we required 
the atmosphere is wonderful and the place exudes old world charm 
this is exactly as expected - except for the fact that in europe - you always find the toilet 
a classic on the first floor it seemed small and just a bit behind other establishments i have been in 
there are numerous eaterys nearby for some good food of different countries but a non veg dream 
definitely you can stay at taj exotica if you like the fine resorts with all amenities 
no frills hotel so no toiletries provided except for shampoo body soap dispenser in the shower 
the beach itself is clean - so no problems on that front 
overall a truly luxurious resort 
the pool was also very nice and there were plenty of loungers all around and the whole place 
rooms are very modern and big no complaints everything was more then perfect 
my 3 year old daughter asked for welcome drink but was not offered by the steward who was serving 
rooms are tastefully and well appointed but most importantly the experience is hassle free and staff are friendly 
- big video library to rent dvds and they sent some coke and popcorn on our first 
has its own private beach 
location is actually both quiet and still convenient to the city attractions . 
if you want a wonderful room with convenient 
and very tasteful decor 
with super comfy beds 
every hotel in the village is well located given the way the the village is laid out and we had 
the thing that makes it work is the hot tubs just outside the bar 
short walk to the village where all the shops 
the pan pac mountain side is about a 50 metre walk so there really is n't much difference in 
marble bathroom and cosy living room - one night we spent snuggled up on the sofa 
we waited around 30 minutes to order floor and beverage because the pool bar was unattended 
though the property is old as compared to quite a few modern 
i have stayed in several ( historical ) sofitel properties in asia 
large living room and huge bedroom with walk-in closet 
the front desk staff 
great shower nice atrium style central concourse 
also getting a taxi back 
2 mins away from a shopping mall located behind the hotel 
this was our first trip to macau and we wanted it to be memorable 
executive lounge good 
this hotel is a smaller property in singapore compared with other massive five star hotels 
excellent facilities and the rooms are absolutely 5 star 
however for us it actually worked wonderfully well in that we did n't have to contend with the 
we made a booking for one night ( city view room ) but had a change of plans and booked 
in a contemporary luxury style with everything a tourist could need 
the breakfast is a great spread with a nice mix of japanese 
there were free hotel shuttle bus that picked us up from the macau ferry terminal 
you can also walk in 5-10 minutes to center of town and it takes about 5-10 
the hotel has a free transfer bus which meets the turbo jet from hong kong 
the hotel also has a gym and outdoor pool which is nice and popular among the hotel guests 
and on day 3 the staff seated me at my favorite table unprompted 
nice large bathroom full tub and separate shower and toilet area 
n nwatch out for additional charges 
but it was this problem that sent me looking for a quiet space 
great view over the old town from high up and a short stroll from the heart of the city and 
very beautiful pool 
no point in changing the room for the second night because old buildings are difficult and the same problem may 
for the price and supposed stature of this hotel 
the rooms also can be a bit smelly ( old airco system old building syndrome ) when you 
on a previous stay my rate included breakfast so i made the wrong assumption this visit and was hit with 
what i also like about the hotel is that it has some great restaurants and bars within its premises 
the bathroom is really nice with an automatic blind to get your privacy as there is a glass window between 
also forget healthly options at morning or afternoon tea breaks all you get is full fat spring rolls 
the rooms were reasonably sized and the breakfast was good 
shops and the plaza are all just a short walk 
the lobby features a small reception area and a bar where an excellent breakfast 
this property is a well located casino town hotel 
the room service breakfast was a good value and it was very tasty- the hotel offers free shuttle to 
study and then the bathroom - which includes a huge walk-in shower 
we checked in at night and managed to find a local eatery within walking distance with good local food 
i had a quick walk around the casino 
outstanding service , restaurants , facilities . 
the pool was nice - which is a change in macau - just a shame the pool bar service 
breakfast at the seasons restaurants was extraordinary 
within residential area 
a short walk to the city square of macau 
excellent restaurants 
had room service and the onion soup was good but cesar salad was a bit dull 
elliptical and a couple of bikes ) plus a basic set of free weights and one cable machine 
expensive as room service is apt to be 
take the lift and then walk above the departures hall and your there 
it lacks nice restaurants which should be their next project 
the room service was prompt after a long day of travel 
but will explore other airport hotel options if i am not in a hurry or have a super early departure 
you arrive in a fairly modern lobby where check in was pleasant and efficient 
this is one of the best hotels in amman 
the area is very stylish with plenty of deck chairs and umbrellas 
i will definitely stay here again when i am back in amman 
if starbucks can offer free internet access 
overnight on a business trip and enjoyed the restaurant and excellent service provided by the staff there 
definitly one of the best property in amman 
brief visit but good 
7 ) hotel paid shuttle bus service to pbimsince the free shuttle bus service is only for 
the only setback is without a beach as this is a hillside resort 
a nearby grocery store but they said there is no conceirge 
the suite itself was comfortable with small balcony overlooking the pool 
the point provides excellent value 
the decor is dated but fully functional 
the hotel has a swimming pool and a bar 
a notable niggle being that they would not serve you coffee later in the evening 
the lobby was filled with high school kids yelling and jumping on the furniture one evening 
the only minor complaint is that room ( like in most hotels ) was probably too warm 
from the airport it is faster to hop on the express transitway bus than to take a train 
location would recommend the hotel on the basis of the location on the darling harbour has a mall in front 
it 's an extremely old hotel and it shows everywhere 
it was a fairly easy 20 min drive from the domestic airport - a few wrong turns along the way 
the beds were rock hard and i mean rock hard 
just a short walk into the main shopping strip in pitt street 
the rooms were spacious and reasonably quite 
it is a little expensive but the location is good with only a short walk to clarke quay 
i felt bad that my short trip to mumbai had ended with an unpleasant experience in the nice hotel 
this hyatt is a great property 
great bar and dining space 
the pool facing rooms are both quiet and not really affected by much external light at night anyway 
despite the hotel being very busy with a number of vip 's the concierge and the 
the breakfast is one of the best 
not the usual bland modern decor 
bathroom had separate shower and bath and a nice range of toiletries 
good work grand hyatt team , ) ps , please relaunch china house ( the club 
i have stayed here on a few occasions and really enjoy it . 
dinner in buffet restaurant great 
after a long flight i went for the balinese massage 
and both the pick-up from the domestic airport and the drop-off to the international airport were 
the room was a good size with a nice comfy bed and clean went to melba 
there is a small mall adjoining the hotel with a good selection of shops although not too many shops 
it 's a huge complex with big restaurants and lounges 
the food were superb and the ambience of the hotel matches the royal hawaiian 
a good strong shower and plenty of space 
location wise is actually closer to the airport 
close to all public transportation 
if you are a tourist you might want to choose a location closer to the down town area further south 
excellent hotel with unique location 
breakfast is excellent easy walk to city will stay again 
you can do so much without leaving the hotel and their dining options are amazing 
we are the customers and they should work around us 
the service at the door and at reception is brilliantthe room is wonderful - soft 
service levels are top notch 
the work desk was comfortable but the fake wooden flooring was too slippery for the swivel seat 
good restaurants and close to the centre of town 
the room has a good size but might be a bit small bed for 2 person 
eg free drink 
now the pool - wow is all i can say 
the bed is one of the most comfortable i 've experienced 
my favourite place was the swimming pool - just a quick walk past 3 rooms to stairs straight to the 
we had a good buffet breakfast in the melba but one negative 
nicely presented and very comfortable and well equipped with good wifi and tv cable for those who want it 
the d cor & furniture was rustic & simple in taste with a dash of chic elegance 
disappointed . 
the pool area is adequate for swimming laps but not much more 
its as usual ever green check in was perfect room needs an refurbishment as the room in which i 
here you can have high tea as so many people were doing 
the rooms were always clean and spacious 
even if you request at checking-in that you need an internet 
the only tiny disappointment was the lack of a heated towel rack since we often find those useful in drying 
quick stroll across the river and there are plenty of places to get a good coffee and an excellent breakfast 
but still top quality 
friendly and very helpful reception 
beautiful parks 
the suite was large and the dressing was good 
perfectly situated for a short walk into the city the langham delivers in every way 
refrigerator and french press coffee maker in the room as well as an electric kettle 
the hotel itself is quite mediocre with small sized rooms 
however the noise from other guests totally ruined this hotel for me 
hotel rooms ) and the choices were at either end of a scale - hyper luxury or dodgy 
since singapore is not such a big island anyways 
again if small shower cubicle compared to some 
the pool area is nice 
not to mention the superb club facilities on the 22nd floor which includes a private pool and a heavenly 
room was a very long walk from reception but was adequate for the price 
the couple next to me was informed that they are receiving a complimentary upgrade 
wow talk about great value 
hence the lower rating this time around 
felt like soaking longer in the bathtub with those smell 
there was a street full of good restaurants ( as recommended by local colleagues ) of different cuisines 
very bad hotel if you stayed at full house ( high season ) 
good location - decent facilities 
the towels are very scratchy and should be replaced 
the hotel is very quiet - soundproofing is excellent 
yet steps from the old city 
excellent service from check-in through to the time to leave . 
which was very stylishly decorated 
the person at the front desk barely even looked up and did not greet us 
hotel offers free shuttle buses to narita airport or narita station 
the shuttle bus is available for those who want to go to narita or aeon and it is 
very good airport hotel 
the room had a decent view of the surroundings and the airport 
the marriott in lisbon is ideally located for business close to the airport but also close enough 
close to major attractions and airport - ideal location 
the location is not central but this is not a problem as there were plenty of taxis waiting outside and 
it is tiny and did not have a separate shower and tub 
unique shaped building 
the room has great lighting as well as a comfortable king size bed with great pillows and bedding 
if we had known how nice this hotel was 
continental breakfast was complimentary for spg platinums as a welcome amenity 
the gym is decent equipped and spacious and the pool big enough for laps 
top notch 
english speaking staff helpful 
i 'm a platinum starwood member so i was lucky to use points cash for the room ( 
the outside fire pits and bar were lovely also there restaurant was really great 
the hotel beds are comfortable and id you are fortunate to have an upgrade 
great airport hotel 
if it was n't for the airport you would never stay here 
the shuttle service is easy and the hotel is about 10-25 minutes from the airport 
it 's a reasonable value on hilton points 
i do n't stay often at hilton family hotels outside the us because they are usually too expensive 
we chose to stay off in the villa 's and had large rooms connecting and a short stroll 
and the 25 metre 4-lane pool is one of the best i have seen ( and used ) 
it was ok , nothing fantastic but not bad either . 
the gym was very very up to date with very modern equipment 
we looked at a number of hotels in goreme and picked kelebek based on the reviews and 
the bar is open all the time 
this property does a great job from a-z 
and he said that we were the last booked guests to arrive 
bright hallways and rooms 
very light carpets that were stained and dirty when exiting elevators on various floors that we saw 
i would say that the hotel deserves a better rating ( very good ) 
the bathrooms are well designed and the cast iron tubs are a nice touch 
decor is modern and tactful 
rooms good size but i thought some aspects did n't quite work 
i 'd stay here again . 
convenient location 
taxi ride from airport only about 23 euro 
and a few small stores 
greeted by two very nice front desk ladies and once they looked up my name and saw we 
very comfortable bed and bedding 
my only reason for a 3 and not a 4 rating was the thin walls 
the lobby bar is over the top with veteran bartenders mikeland his able young assistant fous 
nice lobby with nice cinnamon smell 
and right after i get there i needed to go to registration desk for the next day 's race 
the dining room is a bit too shiny 
in general noise detracts from my satisfaction with a hotel but in this case it was all just part 
outside is a small parade of shops and restaurants - the only place there 's any sign of life 
the hotel does have beach beds but they do cost 20 a day regardless if you use them or not 
very busy streets right at the door step 
that for a hotel that is so highly priced 
second , the first real difference actually started even before the moment we entered the door on the ground 
and the property had a general old feeling about it 
the pool was lovely and service there great too 
classic modern taj property 
rooms with two queen beds very spacious and perfect for a family of 4 
the room has a great view of the burj and size and amenities are adequate 
great location right on the bund , beautiful in the evening . 
we stayed earlier at the also lovely shangri la where the prices were fine and the bars and 
i liked the design of the common areas too and the indian theme all the way through 
the property has maintained its cleanliness from when it opened and the benefits of having washer and dry 
also walking distance to shops and the pedestrian mall 
the area was perfectly clean at all times 
close to chong nonsi sky train and silom . 
i have had to rewrite my top 5 hotels to include this one 
the spot is definitely 's five star with plenty of towels great attendants and a very nice pool 
the size was good however all the furniture is tired and dated and well worn 
average hotel not sure why so many positive reviews 
we stayed at the hilton after a 5 night stay out on the islands at an adults only resort 
food was delivered cold and consequently sent back and the bar service was next to non existent 
) and free wifi 
the staff were superb saying bula with a wide smile 
on my recent stays at a number of hilton-managed hotels ( particularly the budget ones ) the 
unnecessarily large kitchen table area 
this hotel is across from uc irvine medical center 
the resort is very well set out and there is a restaurant and pool for adults only which we very 
much street food also available from the soi and surrounding areas 
the hilton brand is associated with a level of quality and service a notch above where others might be 
worth it to take the breakfast included rate 
it had a huge bathroom and dressing room with complete amenities 
the pool is too small to do laps in and the fitness room is rather small with a limited selection 
though they are clean and beds are comfortable 
rooms perfectly nice no complaints at any point 
and helpful- free internet is always a bonus- the airport limo bus takes you direct from nar 
champers good price at lobby shop 
the hotel lobby is very nice with a restaurant ( though expensive ) with great views 
it 's central to numerous shops 
the hotel does a great job of soundproofing the rooms for a restful night 's sleep 
dinner at tribecks has special deal for guests and offers a great view 
good to see that they replace mini bar with convenient store that opens until 11pm 
lots of food and shopping right outside the hotel 
bathroom was nice size 
airy lobby 
very please good option stunning views took a corner high floor room with beatiful view and good room size 
room are nicegood size and amenitiesthe major pb was the front deskpeople are nice 
plenty of nice restaurants and shopping with easy walking distance 
great value for money as the room rate is very reasonable 
the hotel 's location is excellent -- close to numerous department stores 
service requests such as requesting toiletries or providing directions to local shops and restaurants were completed quickly 
stayed in this hotel for 2 nights 
it is not exactly of much use to say it is nearby shinjuku station 
suitable amenities were provided . 
and european options were extremely limited 
my room was clean 
the hotel pool is nice and also there is a good gym for a workout available 
this was a perfect touch to the ending of a memorable holiday 
i was only out for breakfast for 30 mins and when i 'm back to the room 
my room was great 
the price is also reasonable so i do not hesitate to recommend the hotel 
its located very close to the airport & is about 15 minutes drive to the city centre 
a great transit hotel 
pool was great with access to mandalay 's pools if you choose 
outstanding service the four seasons staff make the hotel . 
very nice property just on the fringe of the airport 
the restaurants in the hotel are quite good and the buffet in particular is one of the best in do 
stall shower and separate tub 
and an amazing spa 
it 's a nice hotel with large rooms 
prosgood spacious roomsgood house keeping and turn down servicepolite check inshuttle transfer 
very late but still we could have a few drinks on their outdoor terrace 
it also has its own pool which is quiet and beautiful 
the restaurants were good and the device at the pool was excellent 
did n't try the food but a couple of options available 
as well they will charge you for any printing 
the pool is nice and quiet 
unless you plan on hoofing it for a really long walk 
the four seasons is the top 5 floors of mandalay bay 
we were there in the middle of a snow storm and the heating was fine 
even though the view is fantastic , i just ca n't understand paying that price for a room so 
it was all lovely - pool 
the shared bathroom was always clean 
the restaurant was nice and served good food ok prices both in the evening and at breakfast 
comfortable and well located right at the top of the bright angel trail , so great for early starts 
we were upgraded for free to a strip view room which was much appreciated 
i booked as part of a city break package with cathay pacific which included airport transfers- good 
this was only 24 so we felt that this was good value 
if you are looking for a budget and comfortable stay in hong kong 
decent , quiet , different classy , quiet , decent , for a nice romantic weekend in las ve 
positives include a great and hugely varied breakfast , a rooftop pool , and a cheap laundry service where 
very good value for money 
and i was willing to risk it since the price was right 
this is a very nice hotel in the west queen 's road area of hong hong 
the hotel has a splendid lobby and looks fantastic 
lots of local restaurants and little shops in the vicinity 
the waterslide is a hit for young and old 
this is a large resort with shops 
things i did n't like , there were so many ants in our room . 
the bed was large 
hotel is always super clean and price is very reasonable 
i do n't understand in this day and age why a shower in a hotel room still has a 
the beach is very limited- not much sand to speak of 
the restaurants nice and the location in funky sheung wan cum sai ying pun 
reasonable prices 
buffet food was adequate but not inspiringthe pool was undergoing renovations and the swim-up bar was 
i guess the higher the floor 
while the gym had a limited selection of equipment 
tends to be expensive and poor quality burger-like food 
getting the courtesy shuttle is also a challenge 
we were sent to a dungeon room facing a carpark past corridors of construction 
although i found it to be a bit small for a suite it was very close to the water ( 
bed was very comfortable and all amenities in the room of the highest quality 
i have to say that many of the staff are really friendly and courteous and helpful 
not close to central metro 
nice business lounge 
hotel facilities are clean and modern and very well maintained 
but it 's very convenient for those who need a parking space next to their room 
with a shower and separate bath 
the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms amazing - in fact the bathroom is the best feature with a huge 
matched by the flawless service and accomodation 
i saw a modern contemporary decor 
a highlight was the indoor heated pool 
ask for the second floor 
n nlounge area was lovely to sit at 
the decor is old style but agree with other reviewers 
only slight negatives - darleys was fully booked so we had to eat at echoes 
this one gives much better value 
high tea and light dinner with great views over river 
good -sized bathroom and very good toiletries 
i was impressed they offered freshly grilled salmon as this hotel catered to a large japanese customer 
we stayed for two nights in a deluxe valley-view room and loved the facilities 
the bathroom was well stocked with free toiletries that were replenished daily and the bed was very comfortable 
the high tea that i had consisted of the club sandwich and that was a good meal 
it is about 10mins walk to ginza station if you walk fast enough 
the hotel staff were very helpful 
unlikely other major hotels in tokyo 
the new rooms wil make a huge difference to the current offer and well worth a stay given the level 
had to wait a long time for my grilled salmon to arrive and when it did 
we travelled in one of the colest may 's amman has had in recent years but we 
a large open area inside the hotel for walking with a small market inside it & a kid 's 
they made my first visit to india much easier 
the lobby lounge area was great 
the only one thing that did pinch our pocket was the lunch we had at the peshawari 
the kaya kalp spa was relaxing and the pashwari restaurant was delicious 
the rooms are decently sized and the service is good 
as we would have been much more impressed with this hotel if it was not following in the footsteps of 
the helpfulness of the staff and the peshawari restaurant ( better known as bukhara 
the gym was clean and user friendly 
i ordered room service several times -- excellent food 
room itself was a good size and comfortable bed 
good restaurants 
gym is pleasanly up to par and pool whiel cold was clean and fresh 
the lounge had a very good breakfast and nice afternoon happy hour 
at a much cheaper price 
the location is good 
but instead chose to enjoy the cheap buffet put on by the resort 
ask for executive floor with a good view 
the rooms was tired overall as is most of the hotel 
my only criticism is that they have a nice roof-top spa facility 
and it was nicely decorated 
a good venue if you are here for a conference - facilities are very good 
room quality great 
the outside of the building is interesting and commands a good position on the south side of a grassy 
tired rooms 
the rooms are spacious and reasonably appointed 
that 's the highest valet price that i have ever seen 
would be a good property if you have a couple of small children i would think 
many of the teens hadterrible snooty attitudes and we found the guests at the hotelun 
there are some decent shops if you need to buy hats 
clean facilities and top service 
there is a small beach on hotel property but i did not go in 
concierge service very helpful and recommended several fabulous tours that were close bymy husband took part 
their rooms are spacious and well appointed with all the amenities you would expect from this hotel group 
breakfast was minimal but of high quality 
no extra pillows or blankets 
it worked well for us before our early flight back to the states 
especially at the front desk 
the spa was nice 
the pools are open from 7am until 10pm 
difficult if using a wheelchair for example food in the hotel is a great quality with friendly staff and 
the location is perfect and there are many restaurants at the hotel and near by 
you can get better food when you exit to the airport and there are good choices as well 
look for the stairs between the parking hall and the fake waterfalls to get to the next door shopping 
nice and spacious room 
furniture have a modern layout but have been done with cheap materials ( some of them are already 
this property is beautiful 
if you want a beautiful hotel with an excellent pool for kids big and small this is the place 
i would feel safe and secure at this beautiful resort 
easy to get taxis and only one stop on the mrt to the main taipei train station 
there are many restaurants within close walking distance and the hotel is 20min away from the main expo 
rooms facing away from the airport terminal are much better - lots of light 
note that pizzas look good and are affordable but other two course meals with wine will cost euro 50 
close to several excellent restaurants and the mrt station that can get you elsewhere in taipei in 
how can they get these meals wrong in italy 
and of course the great japanese toilets ( separate ) 
it is part of the corridor on the third floor partitioned off with low glass panels 
the rooms are also quite spacious and comfortable and the food in the hotel restaurant is amazing 
the pool attendants will assist to your every need 
turn left out of the lift to the walk way over the road is where these apartments are located 
it had a nice view across darling harbour and the city skyline 
the hotel is connected to nearby malls 
i would have thought that the 'request' for a better room would be better 
great location corner room with a view of the harbor . 
staff is attentive and the beverage food option during the evening reception are great too 
2 . 
the lounge area is also comfortable for four adults as there is a settee and two arm chairs 
the hotel is conveniently located- easy walk to restaurants and amenities 
the beds are comfortable and the bathrooms functional 
pool and sauna is spotless and well-run and the spa looked pretty swish - though 
had been to this hotel at least 4 times in the last 12 months 
hot tubs are available for guests which is a plus and the rooms are fine although some are located 
the buffet style dinner had a good selection of items but was a rather pricey 
very nice club lounge 
executive club floors & excellent wifi ) 
bed and bathroom are great 
it is the best of the hotels 
it is an old property but well maintained 
good dining options and close to the activities areas 
the thing to come to sun city for is the amazing golf courses . 
worst part for me was horrible internet connectivity 
carpet is already dirty 
the room was still well maintained and even the common areas which are ages old looked good and updated 
my room parade had separate conference and living rooms and was very bed was huge and comfortable 
i typically stay in a club room and the personal butler service that this provides is a real bonus 
staff and facilities are all first class at the grand hyatt 
the concierge on one occasion walked us to the skytrain and showed us how to purchase a 
the grand hyatt erawan bangkok did provide comfortable accommodations and professional service 
club lounge has amazing evening snacks and drinks 
the room also comes with some great touches like fluffy robes 
this armani designed hotel is so swiftly attractive with attentively prepared surprise gift birthday cake 
had drinks at the lobby lounge after a long day of meetings and it was quiet not overly crowded with 
very good spread at breakfast . 
over and above usually good thai hospitality the service has always been friendly 
the lobby is impressive 
one bed room is spacious 
the appointed lifestyle managers can be contacted 24 7 by simply hitting one button on your phone and they will 
a large living area with table and large wet bar 
the reception was very polite and efficient 
very good resort and service 
we arrived at the hotel very late and could n't really see anything 
the beds were very comfortable and the rooms was quiet and clean 
beach is cleaner than even south goa 
we felt welcome from the moment we entered and were presented with a shell necklace and a lovely refreshing drink 
i liked the pool facing chalets better 
two single beds pushed together when the bedside tables are left in the original positions just made everything uncomfortable 
but the bed was super luxo and i slept like a baby 
large lounge 
great staff 
great beds 
food is good portions size large 
breakfast is only served cafeteria style and the hotel bar is extremely lacking 
you could walk pretty much anywhere and the hotel felt safe 
this hotel is right in the middle of downtown and actually fronted by bourbon street on one side of 
the hotel staff was friendly and efficient 
the hotel does have access to a nice beach and the hotel itself has several swimming pools and even a 
they charged me upfront for be rooms before i got there ( which was not in our agreement ) and 
all facilities suitable for family leisure 
staff really could n't care less and told us to book through booking 
enjoyed early morning walks in the gardens just outside the hotel 
the high speed internet was not really high speed but since we are in the middle east and since you 
and the hotel is luxury 
full separate bedroom 
had to ask front desk every day 
the gym is nice with a good selection of equipment 
very comfortable bed and has free wifi 
we had the chicken mozzarella ravioli and the brown sauce was made with knorr beef 
beach is spectacular as most hotels in the hotel zone 
the rooms are spacious and the included room service and mini bar are a nice touch 
the walls were paper thin ( very noisy people two of the four nights i was there to the point 
service and beverages ( as good as pre-all inclusive--better on the service ) 
average but in the most impressive location 
this is an iconic us branded hotel that get 's lots of screen time in movies 
from the front desk for help 
we had a great 3-night stay 
and they do have a plug to charge your phone next to the bed 
the opposite was true with claire at the front desk 
when entering the lobby area the impression is a little bit old-fashioned in general 
what a wonderful highly trained staffthe location is great and the experience i had makes this my top hy 
close to many attractions in a good part of town 
the bed was fine but the paint was cracked in many places 
although the property is a bit dated 
and the common areas seem to have been recently renovated 
the stuff are very nice and helpfull 
the service in the restaurant is poor and the food just ok 
the private yet glass walled shower in the bathroom is unique and allows you to view the fish in 
food selection more average during lunch and then so many choices during dinner 
newly refurbished in greys and taupe 
nice vibe 
an amazing afternoon tea with superb cakes and a great little courtyard outside the bar 
another great visit 
the only grouse is that the person who took our orders should have told us that the portions are 
the amenities were good and electronic equipment ( bose ) were state of the art a nice bathroom 
it had its own separate entrance 
i think its important to make all guests aware of proper international manners at special places such as fs 
the beach is breathless and the hotel staff was truly amazing 
the entire resort is immaculate 
near airport & fantastic staff nice hotel and is very close to airport with great location and design the lobby 
you could n't ask for a nicer and more helpful hotel staff 
the hotel itself is very well located close to great restaurants and local retail 
the facilities needed urgently renovation and modern touch 
comfortable bed and furnishings 
huge noisy atrium ) and the decor of the rooms suggests nothing so much as a dr 
this place is the typical airport hotel 
as golden circle members we were upgraded to a lovely suite with champagne and chocolates on arrival 
which make the hotel really unique 
a quick call to reception and a thousand apologies later with an offer to change rooms occurred we were shown 
this small boutique like hotel was an absolute pleasure to stay at 
the staffs are very friendly and helpful 
the lobby which is on the sixth floor is in a covered atrium with rooms above looking below 
within easy walking distance to all parts of the city 
ask for a city park view room you will not be disappointed 
but definitely needs some serious work - rooms and furnishings are very old 
i checked and the amounts were different and felt that this was wrong to do this without my permission 
our room was located on the 16th floor with a spacious double bed and room 
the hotel also had a laundry area which was useful 
pros are large rooms and everything you need in the kitchen and the location to the city 
everything is a short walk away and next door at the pulman there is a ready supply of taxi 
excellent in-gate hotel if your transit is longer than 10 hrs 
a ritz carlton is right next door and a huge designer mall right across the street 
the executive lounge is very nice 
the hotel is a midrise property that is located across the street from a higher-end mall 
gym and swimming pool plus all other facilities available 
there is a very nice food court across the street that offers affordable food as well as a nice spa 
this hotel is befitting the visitor who wants it just so 
great facility 
get your next flight 
very efficient and friendly check-in 
fruit juice are all freshly made 
large and comfortable bedroom and bathroom 
breakfast also was disappointing with a very limited selection of western food and of a poor quality 
the employees were extremely friendly and courteous 
this hotel is not worthy of 4 
within walking distance of a large shopping mall and several government departments 
this totally competent five star business hotel is the perfect choice for those travelers not looking to be in the 
so is close to shops and places to eat 
they 're a lot better than what i 've experienced in comparable hotels 
the breakfast buffet is very limited and get boring fast ( we will be back here for 3 more nights 
the bed is a slat bed and when you sat on the bed 
the breakfast had cold eggs 
hotel is close by to the large shopping centre and the large number of restaurants located in the civic 
which is a nice touch 
the bathroom was a shower over bath and the amenities provided were basic 
and the hotel has been maintained very well till date 
breakfast buffet has a reasonable selection of both hot and cold choices 
get breakfasts included in your room rate 
the staff are really excellent 
the hotel was warm and well appointed and the meals were equally adequate by international standards 
room was big and had a good desk for work and comfortable bed 
the club lounge provided an excellent selection of breakfast and evening options 
good central location and easy to find different venues from here 
this novotel is located right in the heart of the city and just a few blocks away 
club breakfast and afternoon tea was good plus evening drinks with a great selection of finger foods or light meals 
which has a nice swimming-pool 
stayed overnight for a small conference 
the service was that of a boutique property - personable and friendly 
outstanding value for money 
nice decor 
you are in dc so easy walk to lots of destinations 
but still a nice stay 
right on canal street with easy access to the french quarter 
all the meeting rooms ( there were multiple floors of same ) as well as the lobby bar bist 
and the sheraton 's comfortable beds and pillows did not disappoint in that respect 
the club lounge had great views 
and the nightly wine hour is a nice touch 
there is free wine bar for an hour 
dupont circle is a nice walking neighbourhood with varieties of restaurants and shop 
especially during the evening happy hour for guests 
i tried the taste restaurant on the ground floor and they have a value promotion wherein you pick 3 dishes 
room was clean and wifi working good 
they have a program that offers free refills of either still or sparking water into reusable glass containers in 
and they need to tone down the wattage for their bed lights as it hurts when u suddenly open 
yet again centrally located and with easy access to the marina bay and china town 
i had the chance to appreciate how poor is the sound insulation of the room 's door 
i also asked for a king sized bed and the bed was larger than i expected but very welcome after 
the quiet floors have signs that advertise silent hours 
i will alternate between this hotel and the mercure bugis 
i contacted the front desk about it 
this hotel is very easy to access due to its location near to bugis mrt station also to 
relatively small bath room but adequate 
the easiest way to get around singapore is via a swipe card system which can be used on any 
but the bed was very comfortable 
the room itself is very tired with old furnishings 
i would def not stay here if i was looking to stay for a longer duration . 
the view from the window is about as depressing as it gets 
i brought along a 14 month year old baby and baby cot was available ( i would suggest to 
the staff were warm and welcoming 
the aircon cools the room extremely effectively 
convenient to use public transport- clean but small rooms 
basic rooms 
what raised the level of the hotel was breakfast with large selection of the food ( western as well as 
very nice hotel with tight budget 
no companies and free wifi as usual 
decent stay at the heart of cbd stayed here for a night on my unscheduled business 
the service was pleasant and wi-fi 
comfortable beds the breakfast is fine and the service is very good 
this was one of the better ibis hotels i had stayed at 
balconies are only available on the top floors 
there is a large gym 
staff helpful and good but front desk always long lines 
this property is a blemish 
very good free wifi service 
there are many wonderful and expensive hotels on the french riviera 
close to many restaurants and walking distance to the nice ville tgv tv had good range of 
our room was clean and comfortable and had a decent sized safe 
apart from your staffs excellent service to your guests' thanks ben patten & staff for a 
bathrooms are decent size 
location is 3 blocks from the beach front 
it is only about a 5-minute walk to bugis mrt and the bugis shopping centre 
eat and great access to the mrt stations and some malls 
just a quick review on the third or fourth time we have stayed here 
remembered from last year by staff mr hondabuffet dinner one night ok but 
had been a regular to this hotel for the last 3 years and was pleasantly surprised that the public areas 
hotel staff was busy as they had a wedding and massive rain made their lives much more difficult 
beautiful villa hotel with amazing location and outlook 
we travelled to paresa for a 2 nights stay and had a great time 
there was even a day that they missed cleaning my room and their excuse when i pointed it out was 
not sure 100 on his name was excellent in the lounge 
this is a great airport hotel 
lobby bar had a very good cheeseburger 
the front desk staff has always been very friendy 
but great airport hotel 
the price was slightly high 
had an overall pleasant experience 
the staff are fantastic and the facilities are great 
rooms are adequate and hotel restaurant is open late and staff there are friendly 
it runs around 3 times per hour from the hotel and back 
the quality is what you would expect of a good marriott 
very nice hotel and excellent location 
a good stay over new year 
it was well worth the extra cost 
we stayed here on the way to and from cusco and both stays were excellent 
and we came near the holidays and it was very nicely decorated 
and great snacks food with beautiful view 
clean bathroom with good water pressure 
comfortable bedding 
the staff there finds you and then walks you to the taxi past the crazy taxi gypsies just 
being literally right opposite the main station 
just across the street from larcomar with great shopping and excellent restaurants 
the king bed was very comfortable 
so it could be an early lunch ) with all the typical breakfast food and various main dishes ( fish 
just 100 yards from main station 
the executive lounge is smaller yet works and you have 24 hour availability with limited service 
but yet again - no free internet 
large bedroom and bathroom with separate shower 
the size was adequate and clean 
good old style building 
the higher floors have wonderful views of the beach 
the bathroom was very much that of a lower grade hotel and there was nothing heavenly about the shower 
front desk staff were super friendly and helpful 
the bed was lovely and comfy and the tv modern 
the room was on the 6th floor and very nice with red earth tolietries and very 
the kitchen took great care with allergies 
go high- and upgrade to executive if you can 
it offers good value for money 
very nice touch 
western amenities 
street parking free sat night to sunday morning 
the hotel is in a great location and provides good value for an expensive city 
the decor is beautiful and the bar was really fun 
we stayed four nights having paid extra for a superior river view room ( room 701 ) which was somewhat 
and there was a nice-sized swimming pool at the back of the hotel 
several areas need repair and look outdated 
hotel ambience was good - big compound 
and internet is not free 
a beautiful room ( we had the stunning dovecot suite ) 
we stayed just one night with our toddler and could not have been more thrilled 
each room is unique and elegantly appointed 
the train bringing you to the airport in 20 minutes 
you are treated like royalty from the moment you drive in and your car is parked for you ( the 
altogether an amazing experience which maintains a very high level of service from beginning to end 
had we been staying longer the kitchenette would have been fantastic for making our own meals with food from 
bar on 39th floor still good but needs a serious make-over 
good value for money hotel 
there were sayings that they do show ms there and it was actually several floors 
goj station station is also just one stop away from kyoto station 
i had better priced rooms in 4 5 star hotels with bigger space for similar period 
executive floor is also very big and open 
the executive lounge is small and the service there borders on the laughable 
it has everything you could possibly want - different restaurants 
perfect studio apartment super close to the metro & kyoto station 
free wifi in the lobby area if you had your own device 
tough to fit in 2 luggages if you 're traveling with a friend 
the fitness center was one of the largest i 've seen in any hotel 
has terrible reception and there are significant discounts to be had from the 'official' posted room rates if 
a very modern property 
just do n't plan to visit kyoto during cherry blossom season as the hotel rates is 
a small lawson convenience store on the side 
the only comment i would have to make is that it is a small lounge and therefore does get full 
-maybe noisy at night because the bar & reception are open air areas 
a short walk to the french concession and easy access to main motorways etc 
the gym sauna pool area is excellent 
the resort is a well-built nice hotel with great facilities 
the pool is great 
and some other nice amenities ) 
one thing that was missing is the free wifi 
stayed here on a business trip to shanghai for two nights and had a good stay 
throughout the stay until departure friendly and efficient service 
the concierge was very helpful in ordering me a taxi to the airport during rush hour 
i stayed on the executive level and the staff in the lounge is extremely helpful and friendly 
there are better options elsewhere in singapore 
the wifi costs were astounding . 
the service is mostly great 
and have lovely decorations 
rating hotels is a somewhat confusing activity 
this hotel is all about money making and its so obvious 
afternoon hot and cold snacks 
and one with artificial sandy beach 
singer in the lobby was loud ( acceptable - as you would expect with hard rock ) but dreadful 
there is something to be said about consistent service 
it is poorly maintained with dirty grout all over the bathroom 
spacious and very clean 
the lobby area huge and totally indifferent with some staff trying to make you sit and have a drink and 
the bathroom was large 
but when one gets in late or has early flights meetings this is a downside 
467 ) we noticed a bad smell due to humidity 
i have experienced this at hotels in europe and really love it 
i arrived yesterday at this very nice hotel 
location is good and service was good too 
com at special rate for inside facing room 
this former post-office building turned into a hotel is very conveniently located 
a large bar area and the hotel 's main restaurant called town 
the room in my most recent stay had a flight of stairs just inside the room leading down to a 
i would challenge even the most picky of traveller to find fault at this hotel . 
apart from this and a small pool 
free to all guests staying at the hotel 
very good bathroom 
the food in the souck restaurants was poor quality 
can have breakfast and dinner anywhere in the city , very romantic , very relaxing and very rewarding experience 
but not outstanding for the price ( e 
the bed was firm and the pillows were super soft ( think your head falling through them - not 
usually i make it as a dinner as the food are really good 
and the biggest balcony i have ever seen 
nice walk to boat and clarkquay and marina bay sands 
the showers on the mezzanine floor are very helpful if you land up early before your room 
i have been to over 100 5 star hotels worldwide 
and location is amazing 
the beach at the hotel is almost privatised 
oh and who specified stone tops to tables that stained leaving perpetual ring marks everywhere 
we took a leisurely stroll through the foyer and lower floors just to simply enjoy the space and 
the view from the roof top is magnificent 
the facilities were excellent and i liked the fact you could use the underpass and be waterside in 
- property and rooms are in great shape and really nice- biggest pool in hawaii ( from what 
we stayed in a two bedroom two bath ocean view apartment with a central living area and small kitchen ( 
and with so many wonderful restaurants on kaua'i 
i did n't have to wait long for breakfast either 
we had reservations about staying at the marriott kauai beach club based on several negative comments on 
charm will be eventually outweighed by consistent luxury and guaranteed views 
pillows and sheets- bathroom with bath tub and standing showers with nice amenities- gym was good- 
even the gardener who thought ( incorrectly ) that i was lost as i was taking a long walk 
our room overlooked the pool and the beach 
we like this place for many reasons first the resort is located in a very convenient location just 1 min 
the space was very nice and spacious for singapore 
the welcome at reception left alot to be desired - i was given the wrong room so that had to 
so while the price was good 
the breakfast is a good balance of western and asian and the hotel has the perfect colonial feel to 
the suite was fantastic with a huge terrace overlooking the harbour 
probably one of the best in town 
as before chef michael came to table and took the gluten free order 
come for a very special holiday and treat yourself 
dining facilities good and good feel to the hotel without being over the top 
boat quay and the mrt 
an iconic building and a great hotel 
no one at front desk answered when i rang to complain 
except for the excellent location 
didnt swim in the pook as nice as it looked was very off putting as everyone in the 
hotel is in a very accessible location 
a short walk to the river for a nice stroll 
it had very high ceilings and was very large 
great hotel one of the best 
but the hotel has that damp - aircon smell 
and a small fridge with some over priced drinks 
the fine dining restaurant 
very good - but better value for money elsewhere 
the access is easy on a perfect and empty road with great views 
the hotel is located close to the city hall mrt station and a short walk to the river 
the concierge guys were friendly and helpful with storing our luggage the next day 
o on the top of that the staff at the entrance were very rude 
the desert at sunrise and sunset ) lack the service or a comfortable ( great beds ) or spacious room 
a stunning resort - splurge on a villa if you can 
and separate toilet and bathtub sink rooms 
the gym was one of the best i have experience 
service fantastic 
i stay in the hilton property in mid march for 3 days for business 
there is free wired internet in guest rooms 
close to the metro and walking distance from the grand place 
airport train & subway at your door step 
and great location 
opening a window was not an option 
as she did not remove the empty dirty beer glass but did manage to remove the euros left lying on 
with the loss of the conrad there is no decent hilton group hotel in brussels 
facility is located at the right place 
where you can go in the electric buggies which take you to the entrance of the taj 
22 eur for 24 hours ( like a 24 hrs ticket ) is the cheapest otherise you can 
the buffet was great and not too expensive 
comfortable hotel up to the high standards of the top hotels in the usa and the radisson 
if you are looking for luxury and great service 
the breakfasts were excellent 
the bathroom is a good size with a big shower 
the customer service was good enough 
which entitled us to free drinks and canap s into the evening 
a sensible menu is also badly needed 
neutral - food was ok but it wasnt impressive at the buffet restaurant 
inspite of our several reminders they did not clean the room properly 
some monkeys ( not the big nose monkeys which are rare and only seen on the hotels private beach on 
hot water supply not sufficient to fill bathtub and need to wait several hours for water then to be 
that was very annoying and there is no way the hotel would not have known about it 
although it is possible to use the small ( warm ) pool at the life heritage hotel just across the 
it is a nicer property than other hotels nearby ( they tend to be overpriced or ugly ) 
and hotel bikes that you can take out for free ( if you join the fairmont president 's 
it was immacualte and decorated with fresh flowers and great facilities 
food and service was also very good as were the rooms 
when we checked in we were told we 'd been upgraded for one night and then would move to 
modest swimming pool but perfect for most needs 
the hotel is a short stroll to the main shopping area with beautiful views over the harbour 
the car we had booked to take us back to the airport was ready and waiting at the appointed hour 
this hotel is well located and the rooms are very nice 
the rooms facing the harbour give a great view over the harbour 
we stayed two nights prior to a cruise 
it is also walkable to the ferry terminal so it was easy for us to take a boat to 
i 'll post two fotos later that show how the fantastic interior architecture is negatively affected by h 
the front desk did not appear to be very active and alert 
gold lounge facilities were pleasant and of the usual standard 
the hotel is very close to the airport 
fine lounge 
mini bath 
a true luxury hotel 
very nice airport hotel with clean 
the room was very clean even if not so large 
the hotel is near to airport and good for business stay 
and nice amenities 
arid air is normal in hotels but heat in winter is a basic necessity 
the grand hyatt is an old seoul favourite and sits in a great location ( if you like 
i didnt stay here 
minimum good vegetarian options on the in-room dining menu 
the view of the massive electrical tower right outside of the window is kind of the typical welcome to ind 
take higher floor rooms 
pool is 24 or 25 meters long 
they claimed it gave them better food possibilities 
pretty much same as any 4 or 5 star hotel in any big asian city 
it is convenient to most spots in gurgaon 
a massage is a terrific holiday indulgence and i did this repeatedly with a fantastic staff member named su 
clean and good wifi 
to the service was lovely at the grand hyatt 
i did n't get time to try their swimming pool or the gym so not sure about those aspects 
they also have a great pool 
the bathroom is small and sparse - you had to pay for things like toothbrush and internet which really 
there 's a lovely park next to the hotel thats good for a morning walk 
the restaurants are great 
i love the musicians in the lobby and the spacious room 
the decor and atmosphere of the hotel in general was modern & clean with a luxury feel 
the hotel called up the relevant department and found out what exactly needed to apply for an extension 
lots of good in-house restaurants 
one small issue i noticed on a recent visit , the pool is not heated and was therefore painfully 
so if location is what you are looking for this is a decent option 
great facilities in a new hotel 
the front desk staff was very nice and efficient 
this is a good hotel ( using international standard ) and a very good hotel using fukuoka standard 
spacious rooms and decent location 
its location right next to canal city hakata meant that shopping for the shopaholics was really 
with a tiny bathroom 
i believe this is the best hotel in fukuoka 
booked a hotel limo to the airport - very comfortable and efficient - w140 000 
loved my stay at the hotel - the rooms are very nicely appointed 
nothing was to much to ask for and they always went out of their way to help and to make 
however the service is absolutely terrible 
the main tourist street with cafes and shops 
adjacent to the shopping mall and loads of restaurants 
there is very little snacks or pastires 
bed is nice a little hard 
flat pillows 
it is also connected to a shopping mall so there is quite a bit of foot traffic that goes through 
front desk was geared to handling the masses and efficient 
conference breakfasts and lunches adequate and served speedily 
we had the four seasons room on the 1st floor and it was nice with a high ceiling 
taking a shower took longer becasue the volume of water was minimal 
walgreen and publix supermarket is just opposite the hotel from universal blvd 
this was very frustrating as you have to wait very long for lifts 
breakfast is decent but other than that i would beat describe it as a functional business hotel - nothing 
even though your kind of far from downtown and old dubai 
very good business hotel 
the amenities are top-notch ( including free wifi for a limited period ) 
situated in the affluent key biscayne , this residence is naturally eminent in stature from it 's imposing 
still good service and comfort 
but it 's good for a visit to the rum bar 
the bathroom was a good size 
not even close to ritz standards . 
any hotel which has rooms with windows or patio doors that actually open is a favorite of mine 
our room was gorgeous and the view to die for 
the rooftop pool had a great view of the city and riverfront 
separate bath and shower 
there are probably better located hotels within the hilton group for easy access to bars 
the wifi internet is all but non-existent 
proexecutive floors- continental breakfast and afternoon tea snacksturn down servicegood clean spacious roomsgood 
and for once - even wifi was free 
but i can actually say it was worth it and the hotel is probably losing money on you 
the rooms meet the hilton standards but the furniture and the decor are like 20 years old 
we tried out the pool in the hotel and there 
the coffee machine was brokenadd to that hopeless internet service that just does n't work and you have 
hotel facilities are excellent and has a walkway leading right into the shopping mall 
good bed 
alcoholic beverages are available but on a cash bar basis ( charged to the room ) 
rooms are newer than many in area and large 
stayed at the hotel for 5 nights whilst working in dubai 
the gym is good size but many of the machines are due for replacement 
i thought the hot water was out completely and started showering in cold water ( not fun ) and 
the location is ok 
the rooms do have nice views 
from here ask to get to the main entrance ( as even the employees and information desk at the mall 
also easy walking distance to the bay and the westfield mall 
impressive entrance and exterior 
however - it was a good tour - you get to cross the bridge which was the north south 
lively but party centralthe only thing i would like to see changed is a softer mattress 
there was also a dog barking in the room next to me 
there is a very good swimming pool - the lady in charge of the sun beds does a great job 
the decor was very cool and i liked the gray and white theme in the room 
the view was of the building next door 
why ca n't the mo sanya separate the area into smoking vs 
you can easily do so as the resort is very big ( but we never felt we had to walk 
we did n't try the gym and the spa but just with a fast look 
staff are ultra polite and so willing to help 
fast free internet and cable tv 
our apartment had a very serviceable kitchenette 
old time elegance 
one if the best hotels in the world 
the bathroom was good sized 
there is n't any way to enjoy the beach properly anymore unless you bring your own beach mat 
but overall this is a very comfortable place to stay and we will do so again on our next visit 
but disgusting and hard to get off your feet - rendering the beautiful looking beach unusable 
if your group is large then confirm that complimentary transport can take your group since they are using cars 
finger food served with drinks is fresh and very tasteful 
especially if i was in canberra with family or a larger group as the larger apartments are very spacious 
beds were comfortable and staff very helpful 
a meeting was taking place in the bar area opposite 
the hotel is at a very convenient location and staff is very courteous and cooperative 
i stayed here for business ( a conference ) and the room was paid for by the conference organisers so 
each time we have had a different room and although the layouts are a little unusual we enjoy the comfort 
the staff was so friendly and accomodating that we did n't want to leave 
bathrooms are large 
the room was very nice and had good furnishings 
location of the hotel was right across golangyo island so one has a nice view of the island 
the food was really good with an exquisite multi course sit down dinner 
the breakfast buffet was very good and plentiful with lots of variety for every taste 
breakfast was nice in the cafe downstairs 
if you have the budget this is a great place to stay and perfectly located for shopping sprees 
a nice stay but jit as other 4 seasons 
the breakfast buffet is very good 
although i must say it 's a pain in the neck to go to the pool you need to 
the large bed very comfortable 
te interior is beautiful and also the stuff is very helpfull 
only the swimming pool is disappointing 
even the front desk could n't do anything for this when mentioned 
the rooms were very clean ( though the bedroom was small ) and well kept 
i found the bed is soft and very nice 
received an upgrade to a nice corner suite on 22nd floor 
modern and immaculately presented property and rooms and located at the far end of orchard road 
canap s and wine which we really enjoyed sat out on the balcony with lovely views across the water 
they took care of the luggage and the luggage was in the room when we got to our room after 
the bed is very comfortable 
service on the roof top pool ( alison ) is always warm 
the perfect hotel 
the foyer and the rooms 
free valet parking is available 
the next day we went for a relaxing massage at the in-house spa - surprise surprise we were 
the restaurants at the hotel are true 5 star and have tried several of them and enjoyed them all 
which is located in the same building as the complex 's casino 
the room is clean and spacious and came with all amenities including wifi 
the conference facilities fantastic apart from the journey to the toilets which bizarrely are on different floors 
the bed and pillows were certainly very comfortable 
i also found the number of barefoot people wandering the lobby and unsupervised kids running around a 
rooms and bathrooms are lovely and nice big soft towels 
not that there was a lot different about it but a ) it was right in front of the elev 
very close to the train station and the harbor so you can take the ferry to the wahiki 
with a large window looking onto the hotel across the road ( sigh ) 
they had welcome cookies with each of the kids' names 
great comfortable beds with lovely linen 
their complimentary snacks by the pool and beach area is something we have not experienced even in other five star 
a large bathroom with a separate 
now the hotel has complimentary wi-fi internet access for all guests so that would be a welcome feature 
there were both a king bed and single sized daybed 
the concierge was friendly 
hot tub next to pool was nice 
but this was all at a very edible temperature 
the hotel located at the end of the white beach which makes it very private and quiet 
the walls so thin you could hear everything next door 
a quiet room and a central hotel but it did n't excel 
it is worth trying one or two of the specialty restaurants the area offers 
one of the best property at healthcare city in dubai 
foyer bar was cosy roomy chairs and nice decor 
spacious and elegant rooms 
but the one you made today were very runny and not to the same quality 
the menu is limited and for what 's on offer 
it is near the train station which has some seedy characters hanging around it 
with separate tub and shower 
the resort is beautiful though 
there is major construction on the main highway ( who knows how many years it will take to finish ) 
there were a couple of conference groups present at the same time 
we were very well serviced and felt like in home 
level four is the reception area level with good views 
it did remind me of a grand canadian ski resort with the huge foyer and fire place looking 
staff overall were ok but were consistently apologizing for why everything was not as it should bethis could be 
i was not provided with complimentary internet when i checked in 
to poor in the main restaurant where the aircon had failed saturday evening 
the staff at the front desk looked like trainees 
however the reviews didnt seem that positive 
cleaning was pretty good - glasses in room could have been cleaner 
the shower only produces a dribble of water - it either needs a good clean or the water pressure 
the bush walks in the area are a wonderful escape from the hectic life 
there is a popular coffee bar ( highlands ) just outside the lobby entrance 
parking because it is next to a golf club function area is a long way from the resort 
we realised that this was a decent trip from the old quarter of hanoi - when you are 
the hotel is nothing special but a good location 
the guest room is a bit out-dated in decoration but it provides good sleeping quality with comfortable bed 
ensuite bathroom and horizontal orientation of the suite meant that it felt like a private apartment instead of 
although there has been some not so positive reviews lately 
i had dinner at bank one night----the service was perfection and the food great 
- super helpful concierge and bellmen- beautiful bedroom and phenomenal bathroom- comfortable roll-away 
the hotel is relaxing and if you like the historic style of hotel 
including automatic blinds 
always wonders me in hotels like those 
unfortunately i could n't check the spa because my girlfriend did not bring her bathing suit and the 
the manager helped us settle in our room explaining everything and he gave us a welcome drink of that special 
beautiful hotel 
blinds and curtains that drew open in the mornings with a switch were a favorite of my companion as 
you can directly access to very nice restaurants and shops especially the best fruit store in japan is located 
traveling through luxury hotels you will always expect the wow effect 
great bar 
the bathroom had two separate sinks several meters apart 
the service is outstanding 
great lighting 
close to some good family attractions ( aquarium etc ) 
it is situated right next to the air canada centre and within walking distance to harbour front 
there were a number of other groups equally perplexed about where their transport was and the whole situation was 
you want a taxi you must call yourself 
also if i can mention we found it strange to call it a 'gourmet' shop and then 
front desk was always helpful 
state of the art rooms i loved the rooms , absolute top class ! 
the toilet even had a hand-held bidet attachment but being a non-french westerner 
the gym is a good size with lots of equipment 
the only warning is that the hotel location is not optimal for vacation travelers but the hotel is directly on 
on my last day i had a very late flight so they let me use the spa facilities 
only negative was that the lobby bar is right next to the elevators and so you have to smell 
also has a nice health club on the top floor including good sized gym 
we really liked the heated bathroom mirror however 
from the time that the 5 or so people on the front desk watched as both i and another guest 
decent rate , too . 
the location of the room in the heart of the city does mean that there is a lot of street 
if it were my decision it would be the grace every time . 
the lobby was stylish but i did notice a crowd of sorts there many times 
all a bit choatic and stoill lots of old buildings around 
ask for a high floor and there 'll be no noise 
if you forgot you had to pay almost double price 
great family friendly resort with their own kids pool area and kids club 
the hotel is perfectly located with access to all major sights within walking distance ( darling harbour 
however they should offer internet for free in the room 
on a plus side the staff are friendly ( a few not ) bed are very comfortable and the location 
i most recently stayed at the grace hotel for 2 nights 
the room is decent size internet was not free the food was so so but they do have a really 
the spa at the hotel is excellent 
bed fantastic 
it 's an old building but in good repair and decorated throughout with antiques 
breakfast is the best had in hotels i ever visited before 
with the free mini bar 
there is a small shop in the hotel where you can fill up your fridge - you can buy drinks 
in terms of location should one settle for patong in phuket as ones choosen beach destination 
the restaurants are outstanding and price is reasonable 
clean and friendly property with a convenient city center location 
the high speed internet has given us alot of connections with the work & world 
we found the bed comfortable and the airconditioning was ok 
amenities and a safe which could house a computer 
good restaurants nearby including makphet 
i love the library lounge on the fourth floor--particularly outside overlooking the quiet streets 
also the room service staff was super nice 
with many inexpensive restaurants within easy walking distance 
and nice touches like having loads of free fruit in every corridor 
the night market and the main street 
it is in the heart of the city and along the nice riverfront 
on the other hand i think it is time for new towels 
a bath tub or even something as basic as aircon with this hotel 
very friendly check-in service 
but disappointed with the wifi in the room - relatively slow and expensive 
clearly newly refurbished and enjoyed every minute in the shower with the strong water pressure from the rain 
close to all of melbourne 's attractions trams right out the front 
the water pressure kept changing and it was a torture to shower in ice cold and unstable water pressure conditions 
this hotel was excellent in many ways 
if you 're looking at more peaceful environment and lesser human traffic 
definitely the over water bungalow if you can afford but as far as possible from shore 
very convenient buses to both international and domestic airports and train to different places in japan . 
the beds and pillows were so comfortable 
most hilton 's i have stayed in recent years have all been upgraded to a classy stylish look 
the beds were incredibly hard though so you need to take advantage of all the massage stands nearby 
front desk lied to me 
and a bizarre shower arrangement where you shower on the floor next to the bathtub 
gym facilities is good and i have nothing to complain about 
it sits on top of a subway station and it is across the street from the jr station 
a big thank you to imoto at the concierge desk who really helped with loading our bags 
we loved it that this four seasons had the all inclusive offer which is quite rare for this hotel franchise 
just great and in the lounge there is free wireless internet also 
another nice touch 
good central hilton 
the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was beautifully appointed 
restaurants in the neighborhood are mainly in office building basements on top floors of different department stores 
view was great everywhere we went ) and shorter walk to the restaurants for sure 
the lounge is a good size and is well stocked 
the internet is a bit pricey and boingo is no longer available for use there unfortunately 
so the aerobic and strength machines are crammed into a very small room with nearly zero space to use free 
memorable stay . 
the staff arranged a van to take us into town for dinner and there is a hourly shuttle during the 
tv with good reception 
dinner at king fouads dining area is a once in a life time type of experience 
the club lounge offers good quality complimentary drinks and snacks in the early evening and soft drinks and nibbles 
the view over the lower roof was not great 
stayed for 4 nights and could never get comfortable with the pillows and bed 
rates are as you expect for a central city hotel - and good staff keep the standards high 
we both had the same room on different floors 
the bathroom was average and the air conditioning inadequate 
high floor harbour views 
so it was very interesting to see the different dishes 
when we explained that we had an early flight the next day 
especially if you want to encourage visitors to explore and spend money in your city 
- buffet dinner had a great selection - great happy hour 
the airport express stop also allows access to the back of the hotel through the james cook chancellor passage 
a choice of hot and cold dishes 
the main issue for me with this hotel was the noise of the shuttle trucks and numerous scooters the 
i requested a high floor and as an ihg member a big song and dance was made at 
i will definitely go back again and will stay in the rainforest chalets - it was a 
i have nothing to complain about this nice hotel location was very good 
sadly i wish i could give an accurate review of the hotel but i ca n't even 
good sized rooms 
i have stayed at other intercon hotels in asia and they are fabulous 
but received courteous service and the location beside the botanical gardens and circular quay is hard 
the swimming pool was nice and so was the hotel beach 
great location 
partially obscured by amp building in front but pretty good still 
where someone will sit you down comfortably with a welcome drink and a cool towel while they check you in 
the main dining area ( 1 floor below the lobby ) is dated 
overall this was very good value for money because if you did all these things separately it would cost 
i think it is only natural that a resort of the berjaya 's size cannot provide absolutely 
tucked away in a corner of langkawi with a private beach 
there is a designated area to swim in the sea and the pool also seemed inviting to many 
the pool was nice and i had a nicer time at the sunken bar 
i got good quality of sleep throughout all three nights 
also plenty of restaurants nearby 
there were times when we avoided using the car in favor of uber but that posed problems too as the 
our room was of a good size with a large desk 
good wifi 
there are much better hotels in london 
in fact all the attractions of central sydney 
even a soft ice machine 
fabulous pool 
we would definitely stay here again 
nice warm welcome from the staff at the steps to the entrance - very helpful 
excellent service 
the bathroom had a small window in it with frosted glass 
the only thing i did n't like was that our room was very far away from the elevator 
departure several days later would entitle us to a refund 
you definitely get your moneys worth as it is a different experience and you walk out very full 
for business travelers it is a very good place to stay 
this made our stay memorable 
given three rooms adjacent as six in family party 
the gym facilities were great and the hotel 's location in the upscale saldanha area made 
the concierge is good in giving tourist information and tip on where to eat 
the bed was very comfortable with nice linen and a choice of pillows available 
there are blinds if you need them ) 
and as our flight was n't till late evening they stored our luggage and then provided access to the 
our suite ( very high-up ) had a terrific view of the opera house and the harbour bridge 
mall across street has a movie theater & several food court eating spots 
nice hotel with perfect access to public transportation 
the bed is nice 
we booked a harbour view room and the view was amazing 
but suitable for a good workout 
take the room with access to the lounge at top floor 
the concierge people are one of the best group i have seen at any hotel 
i really have not paid for an extra guest staying in my room at any starwood property ( even 
got to get a high floor with harbour view - it is stunning 
would be happy to stay here again 
in great location 
this hotel is n't particularly impressive 
at the time of check out they tried to charge an additional 150 nzd for the upgrade that 
every night we got the minibus to hua hin city ( about 15 mins away by car 
check-in was painless and wifi available free 
but it happens with every big property so those can be over looked 
staff were helpful with dinner recommendation and the hotel bar was very nice with a good drinks list 
you can not not enjoy the huge pool 
the beach is not that good and if you are looking for a beach holiday i would say choose another 
the internet cost was ridiculous at almost 30per day and the room service left a lot to be desired 
you swipe your room key in the elevator to get access to your floor 
so the quality of sleep is assured 
i had a very warm welcome from reception and they confirmed an upgrade ( hooray for high level 
the bar on the 17th floor of the hilton hotel in hua hin offers great views 
and a lovely red telephone booth outside 
i always recommend higher floors 
it is touted as a private beach front property 
will definitely consider to come back to this hotel if i happen to be in the area again 
pool overcrowded ) 
staff are very polite and rooms are what you would expect for this type f hotel 
even though resort fully booked 
but the pillows way too soft and it made it hard for us to get agood nights sleep 
the concierge team is friendly and very knowledgeable 
the first time we had lounge access and the afternoon tea overlooking the harbour was fabulous 
do you know that in wellington there are 4 free options for internet ( part of making wellington 
and is near a gas station which is helpful for topping up my rented car before dropping it off at 
felt that i could probably find equally nice hotels for slightly less money 
it was a last minute booking and the first time we traveled with our daughter 
get a table by the picture windows and you can watch the world go by 
the bed and linens were fabulous and the pillow menu with a lavender option was a welcome treat 
n ni found the room to be of a good size ( received an upgrade ) and it had a 
the bathroom fixtures and fittings outstanding 
everything in the room works well except the hot water was not hot enough and shower water pressure a little 
plenty of good restaurants 
there are hotels closer to hoi an town 
the beach is a pleasant walk although rip currents meant no swimming 
the staff is friendly and eager to please 
overall a very good stay 
which is gorgeously decorated and fairly spacious 
great bedding 
delicious coffee 
bathroom and walk in closets are great 
it 's a pain in the neck having to get into 2 elevators each time you want to 
the pool and beach are always quiet 
take rooms close to the lifts if shopping is your motto in dubai 
some 500 m walk on the beach takes you to the cusp were the river meets the sea 
a funny thing is that the hallways of the property have a new car smell and since i like 
we found there was a strong smell of musty damp and the bed sheets and pillows were damp 
he is quite an asset to the company with the way he handles guests and their situations 
i would return to the excellent resort hotel 
there are some great restaurants in the streets behind the hotel - you might want to check them out too 
the rooms are structure such that noise from neighbour guests is very disturbing 
with great restaurants on its site 
seems like they would prefer couples stay or families to forcefully take higher category rooms . 
convenient & good location 
the room was huge and very modern and comfortable 
the positon is great as it is connected to the mall of emirates ( the one with 
the property is large and is on both sides of the street 
after i pointed out 8 nights of bad location was n't ok we were n't only coming for 
quiet and the beach was gorgeous full of trees 
many guests opt for the beach side but the off-beach portion of the property is less he 
the buffet breakfast at the hotel had a variety of food and the staff at the hotel is super friendly 
the bts station is at it 's doorstep 
breakfast was really good and the beach was beautiful 
entering the grand hotel you are automatically blown over by the history wooden panels and antique looking furniture and 
at check-in we were given a complimentry upgrade and late check-out 
close to shopping 
a bit on the small side but considering the historical building 
and offering high-end equipments and amazing amenities ( free open mini bar 
clean and spacey room 
but for the price it is a good bargain 
we stayed there over the weekend while going to the basler tattoo and this visit was well organised by 
with very soft beds and pillows 
budget but convenient hotel in downtown bangkok 
service was very good - they even noticed it was my birthday and gave me a small present 
the location is perfect as it 's near chit lom station and close to central world 
so you can skip the gridlock of bangkok 's roads by taking the train around - even 
the bars and outdoor courtyard are great and the resort is within walking distance of many sights 
moreover the bts station is located outside the hotel 
the pool area is quite small and beds get used up quickly - get there quick 
it has a great value buffet 
the pool is very nice and simple 
breakfast buffet was nice 
breakfast was very good with lots of options and good service 
excellent outside cafe to see the world pass by 
the hotel is situated in one of the main districts of bangkok 
room size was good but no bathtub in superior room 
the pool is small but refreshing 
because the self serve pool restaurant is like any other cafeteria and their restaurant longboards 
very good location 
although i had to admit their complimentary wifi was not steady and somewhat slow 
my family and i spent a lot of time at the beach and the pools 
but the front desk staff are not friendly or empathic at all 
parking is simple as there is a multi-story car park in the next building 
the hotel is just 2 mins drive to whalers village with lots of shops and good food 
tje location is very convenient so i recommend this hotel 
it unreservedly deserves it 's 'very good'rating 
try the restaurants near by they offer super local food and very well priced 
a jackhammer going all afternoon above our room and very tiny and old bathrooms all added to this 
it is a very spread out hotel 
great restaurants 
swimming pool is nice and big 
you can get better coffee from a machine 
the bathroom was clean and polished 
there is beach area adjacent to the hotel 
all in all a beautiful property but with just sufficient niggles not to make it a complete luxury 
other food in the various restaurants was very good and the sashmi plate by the pool was very 
was upgraded to the premier wing and suite and the perks you receive is evening cocktails and light bites between 
luckily i got upgraded to one of the suites on a high floor ( 8th i think ) 
i ask for hard pillows 
combined with good noise protection make this a solid choice in porto 
we loved our corner suite and the great treatment from the staff 
nthe hallways were really old looking and the meeting space needed updating 
but a nice hotel none the less 
as long as the price is reasonable 
the towels large and luxurious and the ammenities high quality 
conveniently located downtown close to bars 
i rarely write a review like this 
apart from a minor misstep when we arrived early ( are you checking out 
gym and spa is available 
spot-on location , good rooms stayed there for 3 nights , ending just this morning . 
the only thing that 's good - the location 
a very good apartment hotel 
from the general manager to the concierge 
restaurant is a bit small 
comfortable well-equipped quiet rooms with comfortable beds 
we stayed in a three bedroom apt here for two nights in our family trip 
friendly service 
the ascott really does not have many child friendly facilities 
they have the temporary lobby or check-in counter outside 
glad to see signs that renovations were underway on the lower floor apartments 
walking distance from klcc mall where there is a market on the ground level called cold storage 
the room was adequate size but not upgraded as we were supposed to have being a member of the highest 
and a small balcony 
did n't dine here but did use the gym which is well kitted out and the spa 
service is good and attentive - all team members i have interacted with were pleasant and welcoming 
friendly and efficient reception staff 
the pillows and the towels 
the property has an excellent location 
with convenient access to super marts nearby for quick bites 
nice renovation with newer bathrooms and rooms are nicely sized 
yes location is great no doubts 
the lobby and public areas are terrific 
great fluffy towels and good products to use 
it had a separate little sitting area 
very nice spa ( gym 
it is a beautiful place to call home while in the old city 
while decent sized 
our room was pretty basic and the walls were a bit then as we could hear our upstairs neighbors and 
but nicely decorated 
the beds are super elegant and comfortable 
whenever we go to hong kong we like to stay in different areas & hotels 
we thought the price of our breakfast was reasonable 
dates hotel with great views in a nice location 
also make sure to check your laundry before you leave the hotel i had my sweater missing and only found 
in fact it creates a unique level of luxury that you marvel at every time 
great location but dated 
the only room left was a twin - however it was very clean 
the hotel restuarants are generally ok but do not participate in the spg awards scheme 
- hotel public areas feel a little cramped and busy- we ordered a shuttle to the airport from the 
great sized beds for europe 
with the bar right there 
still would think of again staying at any novotel . 
bathroom was a little cramped for space but the toilet was seperated which is always good 
the only major difference is that they have a nespresso coffee machine - really not worth the price 
breakfast is avergae 
the cleaning staff is very friendly and when you have the right room you will have a ok stay 
there are great restaurants in kowloon 
this is a conference hotel and the public spaces are 
this hotel is just old 
very high price 
soft drinks free 
no noise and great views 
the color palate was yellow with dark wood furniture and there was some nice art work on the walls 
nice club on the top floor and a super steak place mortons on 4th floor 
good overall hotel 
the bed was comfortable as well as the furniture in general and the internet was good 
concierge and bell staff very good 
i love the spaciousness and the view that i had 
the bed is comfy and the room is big enough that our baggage would n't be underfoot 
the lounge amenities were as one would expect 
free internet is provided on the ground floor-another perk often not seen at luxury hotels unfortunately 
or so the front desk told me 
the room was on the small side and the price was on the high side 
therefore it is not easy to find its good quality 
it 's a great location to stay 
for my second and third nights i was in the main courtyard wing and this was a huge improvement 
dining and lounging area there with good harbour views 
very helpful concierge desk 
room was v spacious and had the bonus of being very airy with natural light 
what would make my stay even better 
just be aware that the property is a bit old and you can feel it here and there inside the 
pool was small but on roof so that was nice 
and good sized rooms 
only thing is that those rooms facing the streets are noisy 
asked reception and they promised work only between 8am and 6pm 
it is about 20 minutes drive from the airport and circa 20minutes walk from the main attractions of 
a quick search under the desk revealed a single socket on the bottom side of the table top ( i 
excellent hotel for business and family stay when you visit hong kong 
after an unpleasant event ( losing my bag and its contents on the airport express shuttle ) we checked in 
full size hairdryer 
i went back to to desk and the room had been ready for awhile 
having a pool and multiple jacuzzis on the rooftop is an incredible advantage 
modern facilities 
located on the kowloon side and near the harbour so you can get the boat if you 
bathroom is interesting with a full size jacuzzi bath ( nice mood lights ) 
wireless coverage in the gym was pretty good and the view from the cardio machines was great 
and eventually lunch and the commute back 
4 complimentary water bottles were provided 
was a little overwhelmed at check in as there are several staff in a nicely done up but small lobby 
free wifi in the lobby is also a big plus 
it had a good spread however i thought the quality could be better 
the place is way overpriced , but you are paying for the the lack of choices . 
we stayed in a spa room and although the whole idea of having a spa in such an arid 
modern and the spa was set in an alcove that overlooked a desert scene that was totally private 
and i questioned house keeping on why we were charged and the bottle was not opened and it 
but the dinner buffet is average at best 
and was marred by poor customer service on this matter 
the bar makes all its profit in one drink i think because i am not sure you would be back 
the shared toilet and shower facilities were good - powerful 
i found sheraton hk has a decent space room and everything is great about the hotel 
that left the bistro and the pizzas 
a room facing the wharf is a good option 
moldy smell in many parts of the hotel 
during my previous stay i was put in the tower block and the room seemed old but fresher 
the aircon is either hot or cold 
which was a great value as compared to a room rate where one purchased these separately 
the bathroom was spacious 
it 's in a great location on crazy nathan road with the star ferry pretty much just outside 
is their fabulous top floor oyster bar and restaurant 
a good hotel located across the road from the historic peninsula hotel 
and this hotel is getting better every time 
great location on the water and good food 
located in great part of town 
i liked the fact that the staff reminds you to check if you 've left anything in the c 
overall this is a great hotel in the newcastle area 
the rooms are okay 
generous sized rooms with a separate lounge area 
concept rowing and a very large free weights section 
make sure that your room is on the harbour side as views across to the harbour and the exciting buildings 
shopping and huge choice of restaurants make the location perfect 
take the train and connecting minibus next time - quicker and safer 
and free internet 
prefer other hotels nearby 
hotel is well located on harbour end of nathan road 
of course the food is expensive but the quality is excellent 
the lobby with all the marble is really stunning 
the 12th floor is a good option 
one thing which stood out about the lounge was the service - without exception the staff were all very attentive 
right on nathan road and easy access to star ferry and mtr 
and the spacious lobby is well furnished 
- ( 1 of my colleagues stayed the same night and he has none of these issues incidentally so may 
so if you are tired and have been working you need to go out to one of hundreds of great 
the bed was extremely uncomfy and the pillows flat making for a bad nights sleep 
a few minutes walk from king cross this is a clever concept for those on a tight budget looking for 
the hotel offers several good restaurants 
walk about 25 meters and there will be a bus sign for the airport express 
meeting room was excellent 
only small issue was audible traffic noise from the street outside despite being on the 4th floor 
every time we asked the staff any thing they could n't be more helpful 
5 ) the soap holder in the shower had an inexplicable gap on one side 
and aud60 for a simple dinner at night ( ie 
pay parking is available across the street in a secure lot 
very quiet at night so good sleep acheived although bed was a little hard for my liking 
we did receive free internet access and a very small bowl of fruit in our room with a welcome note 
the deluxe harbour view rooms - although much bigger - do not have the same view 
only slight criticism is that whilst the bathroom is very large 
the security measures are good since the reception is at the 2th floor and there are security personnel checking 
restaurants and shops are nearby 
it is also a short walk to a strip of bars along the water which are in a great position 
good travel desk near reception 
a refrigerator and a decent sized dining table rounded out the kitchen area 
quality blockout curtains allow you to shut out all the flashing lights and it it surprisingly quiet in the 
with a tasty omelette bar 
as it was a short trip for us 
the club lounge is recommended if only for its scenic ambience 
pool is nice with good shade and a nice pool bar 
would recommend this hotel highly 
as a diamond member i was offered my key packet right in the lower lobby and was able to skip 
we have had some fantastic hotels and lodges while we have been in borneo 
nice beds and large bathroom 
malaysian and chinese items available 
there is parking available underneath albeit at a cost 
great location pumping activity nice rooms 
only real critisism would be that the wifi is very flakey 
actual building outside looks run down considering it was built recentlystaff are nice and helpful but money driven on 
the swimming pool is a little small for the size of the hotel and the area seems a little unt 
stayed four nights this week in great location and spacious rooms 
the quality os low even if you do ask concierge to assist 
great service n at ideal location in the city fscing the sea 
its central city location is perfect for the business traveller and the night markets are also at your doorstep if 
and a short walk away from the amazing food of chinatown 
breakfast in the hotel is a huge buffet 
so being able to walk to my test site in center city and being able to get a good night 
i expected better service 
and proximity to the lifts made everything very convenient - went from parking to their rentals ( which takes the 
excellent staff 
i had a great room service breakfast and a terrible room service late night snack 
if it 's luxury sophistication you 're after - forget the metropol 
really good amenities such as the pool and gym 
the good sized room had a comfy king-sized duvet covered bed 
very good wifi 
there is a feeling of being chiselled - cad 100 for a week 's internet ( shame 
went for 2 days of meetings and was upgraded to lovely 1 bedroom suitegym was great and an 
parking is 18 for 24 hours in the public parking of the casino ( but if you leave you 
our one bedroom suite was spacious and comfortable with a bedroom 
pool area is great 
room on lower floor facing inwards so there was no street noise 
room is quiet we had a good nights sleep no outside noise at all 
stayed in a luxe room on the 23rd floor quite a distance from the lifts so it 
ask for a high floor 
front desk was cheerful ( 5star ) 
the pool area is great as is the beach 
we had breakfast included as part of the package in mr hive 
old towels 
plenty of other food options nearby and of course everything else that crown has to offer with easy access 
was spacious and tastefully decorated 
not cheap but you get what you pay for 
the hive ( was gordon ramsey 's mesh ) has a great all day menu and the 
the corridors are in desperate need of refurb very tatty and dated my initial impression was if the 
the room which face out over the front lawns was well appointed and the bathroom had a lovely shower 
gorgeous infinity pool and spa on the 27th floor with an adjacent fitness centre 
king room was beautifully decorated with black and cream modern furniture 
westin offers the best vantage point to get around this city while maintaining a comfortable living environment 
the location was good for walking in the older sections and near the creek and the museums 
this is a great property 
small bathroom ( would you belive dymo tape voltage advice stuck on the wall 
smell of mould everywhere , dirty , could hear the snoring and shower of guest in room next 
as you get complimentary afternoon tea 
the last 2 visits in 2011and 2012 have in my opinion seen a marked decline in the overall standards 
there are plenty of far more modern hotels in dubai but this is a popular place to stay 
but did not accept to aknowledge that it should be given for free according to their own website 
the front of the house for this hotel is very nice 
staff were good 
good location 
shower excellent 
they have nice restaurants 
spacious room with walk in closet and vanity area 
it 's a 10 - 15 minute walk to the nearest metro station which was easy enough but not 
i want to generally praise the westin in the wake of our four-night stay ( combo of 
with stunning contemporary furnishing and large beautifully appointed rooms 
the room rate is expensive here - for a similar yen you can stay at the okura where the 
and osaka ) and hiroshima ( the sheraton hiroshima did not have 
clean with separate dressing room and bathroom located on each side of the entry hallway 
big bath tub 
albeit small mall attached to the hotel 
westin miyako is well past its 'sell by' date and would need a complete renovation 
impression on our first visit 
there were also other small eateries within walking distance 
the rooms were spacious and adequate 
breakfast was buffet style and offered a range of cold and cooked options 
this must be one of the grand dame in kyoto as the exteriors definitely show 
a beautiful hotel on the shores of the atlantic ocean in cape town 
we found the staff extremely pleasant and helpful 
new toiletries were not provided until the fifth day and only upon request 
it may look just somewhat dated but is well maintained and very clean and nicely decorated though rooms are clut 
the rooms are very standard 
its location is great 
overall this is a very nice hotel that has been tastfully remodelled 
it only had a shower 
we had an excellent meal . 
the hotel restaurants are fine and it has a marina and the walk between the hotel and the adm 
check in was smooth and room service was attentive 
request a high floor 
i ca n't really blame them for the taxi situation ( the fact that taxis hardly ever come out 
good room and impeccable service 
i know of the landmark from previous visits to thailand 
the area is a bit sleazy and down market but very central 
n nthere 's a bus stop next to the hotel 
the lobby was small 
the hotel has a small pool 
food was satisfactory and lacked appeal . 
for my size and the number of luggage bags we had 
stayed at the skyline room top floor and had club access due to elite status 
the hot tub pool were very nice 
there are several good restaurants and pubs nearby 
the toilet mad weird noise when flushed 
if looking for some luxury or are in singapore for holiday sightseeing you might want to stay some 
they found a lesser room for me 
breakfast spread can improve and the speed of service needs to be highly improved 
there are better and much more expensive hotels in singapore but i love the fact that i can exercise 
there was a small but adequate bathroom with nice thick bath towels 
where my regular hotels are chargeing s 600 to s 800 per night 
even with the atmospheric lighting in full swing 
room size is not huge 
you may click on my multiple reviews on other hotels and note that i have scored hotels fairly and most 
the gym is very good 
the staff were very helpful during my entire visit and made several good recommendations for places to eat and visit 
) they give you a nice treat 
had great views of the castle and enjoyed a nice breakfast 
the room was clean with standard fittings and super slow paid internet 
the room was a good size 
plus there are welcome warm cookie and complimentary 2 bottles of spring water and 2 bottles of sparkling water in 
old charm buildingbreakfast 
do n't forget to do the rice paddy trek - your butler will take you on 
has a pavillon with internet outside 
good views of bay 
you can just leave all the planning stress to the butler and enjoy your holidays without worries 
the free shuttle bus takes a route that gets you to and from central in less than 30 minutes and 
the heat and slightly disappointing retail options we felt it more relaxing to just stay in the resort 
swimming pool is good 
superb cuisine 
the buffet breakfast was quite good and offered a lot of variety 
we stayed here for our honeymoon and we 're treated like royals 
they even gave me a small plate of snacks to enjoy thanks to club status 
the pool is wonderful too 
there are a few good restaurants around 
it s in good distance to hectic central and still just a short taxiride away 
our room had nice sea views and despite the drizzly 
the bar is very small with no table service and what is major frustrating for every guest ( as everyone 
the only way they could improve the room would be to have power points next to the bed as so 
room big and spacious with a spa shower and excellent views of the city 
cats where eating food on the tables when guests left 
but a large shower with a big white marble floor 
the gym is good 
on occasion we stay in the suite , the extra living space and sound system are overwhelming ! 
and there was a long wait for taxis 
families - excellent pool 
this is excellent modern hotel in a tranquil - yes tranquil - part of hong kong island 
the same room rate would get you better serice and a larger room elsewhere in hk in a 
the room was ok 
concierge desk was really helpful and helped me with a few things 
they take such pride in what they do and make every guest feel special 
the view is amazing as you can literally see the bund from the hotel room ( as long your room 
it was very convenient that the hailun subway station is right across the street and is about 3 stops 
it 's great if you can get a club room as it 's very good value 
when we asked him to bring the same menu card again 
but i became accustomed to the short walk most shops and attractions as well as the great service at the 
the hilton hanoi opera hotel can really use a renovation 
starwood preferred guest with lounge access - well worth it 
i was running a bit late for checkout 
nice pool 
my bed had a huge downward hump 
the pool was lovely ( though small ) and the staff at the pool and gym were very helpful 
i won t be back . 
facilities are older but still well kept and could benefit for some slight refreshes in the furnishings 
location is quite good - close to shopping and the gay oxford street district but quite away from the 
and sound-proof windows 
breakfast in the lounge was also good with a number of dishes available to be cooked to order 
coffee was good 
stayed here for 2 nights with our young family 
the door staff were very good at hailing a taxi and explaining where we needed to go 
the hotel is in good location with hyde park in the front and a couple steps to subway station 
except that the rooms are a little dated and has n't changed much since i started staying here way 
rooms need some renovation but clean and spacious 
location just off hyde park - so very central and close to metro station 
it was newly refurbished 
easy access to airport and cbd 
large bathroom with shower over the bath and a separate good size shower cubicle with an excellent shower and 
the bathroom was very large 
location was perfect and the area around the hotel was good for cafes 
unless it 's refurbished you are probably going to be disappointed 
so if you want to toweloff in private you have to do in the shower 
with a bath tub and shower separate 
and the front desk bell staff room attendants are great 
hilton hotels can vary enormously between different countries and i find that the hilton brands in asia 
the free laundry machines and cute design of the hotel as well 
the taxis that are linked to this hotel charge a flat rate of 370 
hotel restaurants are good and the exectutive lounge is busy with satisfied visitors 
the convention center and the pier 
although the room is a bit old but it is still spacious and comfortable 
brown faux marble bathrooms and late communist style brass lift trimmings set the tone 
this is an ok hotel to spend a few nights in - the advantage is that it is within very 
shiny and new but poor service 
food quality at the chinese restaurant is excellent 
and comfy chairs in the lobby 
fairly close to the main street and night market -perhaps 10 minutes walking 
however the wait was long and it was getting close to late evening 
service floors you 
the area is reasonably quiet 
we also had executive club access and the food and beverage offerings were of a high standard 
the view from the room is nice especially if you can get the one that faces the river 
they also gave me a complimentary drop to the airport next day 
friendly and even walk you to the lift 
everything was really good in terms of service and standard but the building was just odd - like a fab 
sometimes a little lacking in other chinese hotels 
as its away from the main shopping and business districts and is a high traffic area 
great place to stay great swimming pool definitely will return 
especially with a wet floor 
for complimentary transfer in case your departure or arrival is from international terminal 
the hotel is situated next to the international airport and is apt for travellers who have meetings in bk 
high floors 
get a good nite 's sleep 
breakfast buffet was good but the selection could be more 
spa tower not as nice as main hotel 
the hotel had arranged for an airport transfer which is about 1km away so was in my room in 
the wi-fi signal is excellent wherever you are so that you are online 
good food and very clean - very close to int airport- rooms spacious - value for money and enjoyed 
room clean , check-in efficient , did n't use any other services . 
good airport hotel 
the radisson is always the most expensive because its inside the terminal so what you 're paying for 
gave up and had cold shower 
good airport hotel 
with fresh decor 
generally at airport hotels you get near constant movement with people getting up for flights at all times but 
i was attending a meeting in the hotel and the meeting facilities are adequate 
downside - a tiny swimming pool and even tinier changing area that was not very clean 
the novel wardrobe had a full sized ironing board and iron 
but it does have a gym and pool that you do n't get at smaller places 
the bathroom is also of a good size 
room large with lovely bath 
the train station is right next door so very convenient for that too 
the king size bed was comfortable but the pillows need a refresh 
it took 2 hours in heavy traffic to go a distance which should be 20-30 minutes in normal 
you are asked to stay at the reception desk and the refreshments are served between the passports and copies 
the facilities were beautiful with lovely well cared for grounds and rec facilities 
other than reception it was good 
beautiful swimming pool and gym area 
jakarta has notoriously bad traffic and that was the main reason why i stayed here as my meetings 
there is a large hawker food center just down the road from the hotel in tanjung ar 
the room had absolute everything you require . 
- good location 
what a pity for a prestigious hotel 
we arrived a little early for checkin 
the mattress is quite comfortable but the duvet cover is too thin and feels waxy 
the city is a very magical and calm city a great place to relax 
not much excitement or even a lounge area that is nice to relax 
staff were very good overall including keeping some of the kids in the club floor in order 
we had a great 3 nights stay at the stars 
but probably the best dinner we had in kk 
we will certainly pick the ritz the next time we visit jakarta 
overall still a lovely resort for a great relaxing break 
but it 's a resort and they make it so you never have to leave if you choose 
congratulations to the shangri-la group for the consistently good training you had with your staff 
walking around the city during the day could get a little exhausted from the high humidity but our room was 
much more cost effective 
the staff is really warm 
the facilities are great 
excellent bed 
nice touch 
the bathroom was a reasonable size and the bed comfortable 
the room was large and very pleasant but the pool area very congested 
we had to take a complete round to the place near sunset bar with wheelchair 
so we could easily walk to the pool and the restaurants 
stayed here to get a break from the big city - sin city 
the angsana is one of bintan 's better resorts with very competent and friendly staff 
except for snacks and the prices are comparable to hotel prices 
we constantly felt disappointed - dishes like the beef rendang came with about 3-4 small cubes of 
so two for the price of one 
this is a big resort and whilst it boasts 6 pools there are clearly nowhere near enough sunbeds 
good location but hotel nothing special 
all the more disappointing given the great lunch buffets we had 
but in a very nice up scale neighborhood with neat homes 
spacious and the bed is very comfortable 
also good wifi 
we 'll be back next year and would always recommend this hotel to anyone looking for great facilities 
very expensive internet 
good points large room comfortable bed and pillows good shower and newly refurbished bathroom airlines con works well 
bar and lounge area very nice for meeting socially 
the minibus also takes you to the hilton private beach 
loved the bathroom as always and the nice touches 
well worth a visit and i 'll never miss an opportunity to book hdv where they have 
the public spaces and pool are lovely and the sunset bar divine 
and only one pool was open 
only 5 minutes from airport yet quietly location nestled on the mountain with spectaculars rooms an magnific 
rather big bathroom 
if you had to pay do n't bother and go down the street for better value 
they asked us to make our own golf arrangements and call our own reservation dinner arrangements 
nice bar which is serving good cocktails 
the normal warmth and hospitality of the wonderful thai people in the service attitude 
local town naithan beach ok for basics but not much shopping available for the ladies 
opt for the ocean wing top floor - better rooms with an ocean veiw 
plenty of potential though in this new resort but in a competitive island like phuket 
free nespresso and lattes and more and truly fresh squeezed juices 
old and ocean newer with bigger balconies and jacuzzies 
and a big round sunbed 
i was very satisfied overall 
the bed gave us a comfortable night sleep 
and unhelpful and rude front desk woman told us they were going to charge us for the hole 
plenty of healthy options too 
separate from the bedroom area 
the staff is always very attentive 
the lobby is very nice and i love the modern fireplace 
kid friendly resort 
the other dishes look nice and are fine in terms of taste 
the rooms here are diverse - we moved to a 105m2 suite ( with partitioned bedroom ) 
beautiful hotel in wonderful setting 
friendly and ultra helpful staff to the great beach 
breakfast did include an a la cart menu with some nice options 
the rooms are clean and well equipped and the food in all the restaurants is good 
the ocean wing still going through some renovation so better off staying in the garden wing 
this was near the top of the building ( 80 ) 
it was pricey but worth every amount spent 
hotel lobby crowded due to visitors to deck 
more a street market experience where they cook dishes to your specifications 
i heard excellent reviews about the ocean wing from colleagues who stayed there 
it was still raining when we went for dinner but we were escorted under umbrellas and the staff 
in a remote quiet jungle area 
i mentioned this on checking out and was given free parking as compensation 
ask fo a room in the main building as i overlooked the parking lot and it is a little noisy 
beautiful bed 
the check-in area is an open concept and you can actually see the garden and beach next to 
the room had a fridge with complimentary waters 
the other plus of the hotel is the beach side dining 
a little worn around edges but terrific value 
all the staff at the resort are fantastic and very friendly 
food absolutly delicious 
bashes and scrapes on wooden furniture etc ) which i notified 
hotel is closely and walkable but woukd have exp3cted them to have a 
the traffic is so terrible that if you come from a downtown hotel you never know whether you will miss 
the bathrooms are huge & very tasteful 
great location with interesting room 
staff were also not responsive and i needed to make four calls to front desk until someone picked up 
the room is a loft with the bedroom located upstairs 
loft design and scented corridors 
very nice hotel pool with lots of space to relax 
with good comfy lounge and a nice tv and sound system 
pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel 
room is small and would be a problem if your luggage is big 
we checked other rooms and the bed is normally up stairs in the loft area which makes more sense 
we were on the 73rd floor and you can actually see the curvature of the earth 
the room is clean and confortable 
slick and at a good location 
the apartment was nicely furnished in the typical ( practical ) meriton style and had a nice 
we only used 2 bedrooms but had much more room and were on a higher floor 
the location is not far from orchard road were the main shopping malls are located 
and if the front desk tells you there are no other pillow choices 
location - a good quiet area 
location is ok but taxis not easy to get in the evening 
how special would it be for the family to get ready in one of these beautiful apartments 
the gym is a maintaining gym with its limited free weights and machine 
this is because your bedroom will be on the 2nd storey 
the low ceiling not only blocked any air reaching the side of the bed closest to the wall 
nicely decorated 
which worked perfectly all the time- had room service one night and it was great 
ok hotel - with a few hiccups the most impressive part of the hyatt regency cas 
great bathroom 
well-appointed and have more than adequate space 
nice rooms and friendly staff 
the restaurant was quite good 
we could hear the traffic and the light rail 
we were treated like valued clients 
also had a decent gym with good choice of cardio machines 
this stylish hotel has a great vibe 
and while the rooms are pretty small 
but that 's to be expected when you 're so close to the airport 
as we wanted a quick lunch 
location of the hotel is convenient - downtown close to psu 
what a wow this hotel is - from the moment we checked in - we had a brilliant reception who 
george v is quite simply the best hotel in paris and the four seasons flagship hotel 
it never ever disappoints you . 
mini bathrobes 
they failed to mention that the business centre offered free internet access ( something we found out only when we 
the staff is terrific with kids but they do discourage taking even well-behaved children in the main 
my wife left her hat in a cab and the front door found the cab and had the hat returned 
if you do n't mind using taxis or public transportation to get to and from your hotel during your 
the hotel facade is illuminated and they keep the lights on during the entire night - beautiful but unnecessary 
you will often find flashy cars outside the hotel and occasionally see the odd famous person frequent the hotel 
there are also a couple of great traditional restaurants close by - the one across the road is particularly good 
the normal wifi package offers very slow wifi only and is already expensive 
there was free wifi in the room 
the concierge staff is helpful and knowledgable and can help with almost any request 
its like disneyland for grown-ups 
maybe 4 guest eating and some 14-16 tables free 
staff and restaurants are all exceptional 
there is a metro station within easy walking distance so i guess there are cheaper transport optionsrooms nice size 
rooms on higher floors have superb views of the city and beyond 
our stays here have always been mid-week and the service 
two singles pushed together to make a king with really noisy sheets ( sounds like and odd thing to say 
there was everything you could possibly want for breakfast and all the reception staff were friendly 
but busy buffet breakfast on sunday before departing for a leisurely drive home 
the staff at reception were polite and professional and gave me my room key and also a small map of 
we certainly look forward to our next visit 
we had a lovely time - upgraded to a suite on arrival 
in walking around this beautiful town one can clearly see where much of the money from the famous gold rush 
but for the price not up to the quality that is available in the area 
decided on the schaller as we wanted a great bed over larger room hotels with uncomfortable old 
we had a great nights sleep & a great selection at breakfast the next morning 
might be reasonably priced but stay away lots of better options around 
the room was adequately equipped while the lobby and public seating areas were quite pleasant 
the decor was modern and the bed was comfortable 
awesome pool and fitness club and fridges all over the island and its peers filled with free drinks 
it was under significant renovation room was very small 
super breakfast buffet again very friendly serviceand the price is reasonable 
and a lounge bed for you to relax on after your session 
thereafter a 25 min seaplane ride gets to you this small remote island 
i will consider staying at another hilton property on my next visit to toronto 
it wasnt cleaned 
we get free wifi 
but the hotel charged me an extra 5 to get full buffet 
they offered us complimentary rollaway bed and ready to prepare a gift for our daughter on our arrival 
the pool is very good and the gym is better than what specialist health and fitness companies have on offer 
super modern decor and accessories 
a strip of popular restaurants is about a 20-minute walk away 
it is located right on the brisbane river within short walking distance of the city or across the 
our casino suite is a big room with a lovely comfortable bed but so oppressive 
this is a combination of trendy and luxury 
the bed a pillows were perfect we has a great nights sleep 
the gym is new and fully equipped 
i really like old hotels as they are generally better quality 
sounds insulation is well above average and the hot water supply is fine 
) but an awful lot of hotels do that nowadays - and most of them offer a better 
the lobby was fairly small for such an upscale hotel however 
took in the lenox on a little overnight in the city with the mrs and some friends 
front rooms could be loud because of the street in front 
bathroom & bedrooms are large ensuring comfortable environment if staying for a long stay 
the t stops are right across the street as is the prudential with its mall shops 
the hotel is clean but old property so that you could feel the ambience is 'different' 
the breakfast room was gorgeous and food excellent 
location is good - short walk to the main market 
the street below is a tad noisy 
the pool and gym are well equipped and there is also a day spa 
friendly staff 
the staffs were great and service levels was above expectations 
very basic amenities 
the gym was good 
stay once on high floors to get the amazing view 
the holiday started on our third day of our visit and the hotel as everywhere else in southeast asia 
the bathrooms are equally large with a tub that has amazing city views 
i would n't mind staying at this hotel again but i think i 'd check out other sing 
truly worthwhile to visit too 
thank you to the managment & staff for another memorable stay 
rates not cheap but great room with great view 
all staff encountered were brilliant in terms of their service and they always attempted to engage the guests in a 
the city is just around the corner and easy walking distance 
the pool is big enuf as most singapore hotels have small pool 
the trip was a mix of business and pleasure and the location was great for both 
the gym only opens officially at 6 
d cor and style is dated and there are many small items aspects that require maintenance 
we had the biggest bathroom i have ever had in a british hotel - the shower was literally 
request a modern room if you do n't like old decor 
the very helpful waitress asked us if we would mind having a soup spoon to eat our passion fruit sou 
even ventured outside to the jacuzzi and sat there with the april sun beaming down 
staff in the club lounge are excellent too and go out of their way to make your stay special 
it is quite a distance to walk to mrt and the marina bay sands 
huge gripe - on checkout our bill showed a cost of nearly 20 to deliver room service on the 
the restaurant service is attentive but somewhat gauche 
every member of the staff acts like catering to your every whim is the most fun they 've had 
the rooms are very cozy 
with floor to ceiling windows and a great view of marina bay 
the spread was so so and not as good as that on level 3 which has a wider spread 
old word charm meets modern conveniences 
the pool is large 
not a place for families with children as it has a small pool which may be intentional - very much 
we mums have enjoyed the pool time and the beach 
the noise just climbs all the cement walls and unless you are facing the ocean 
the hotel staffs were pleasant 
many thanks to all the wonderful staff that make the halekulani above all the rest 
despite being a new building 
bathroom is roomy and spacious with all of the amenities you would prefer 
only 1 packet of instant regular coffee per day for the kettle plus 1 pack of decaf and some 
a nice walk-in closet and also a great workspace - probably the best of any hotel 
the hotel staff was excellent and was most helpful in all aspects during our stay 
we spent time at the swimming pool which was tranquil and thankfully not too busy 
however other than that the room is quite large but very basic 
it is an excellent value 
breakfast area are extremely nice 
with a powerful shower 
i mentioned needing to get to the airport later that day 
mediocre rooms 
a real palace 
- service from all members of staff was wonderful- room was beautiful and very well appointed- breakfast was 
i also consider very expensive the business center and the internet connection in the room 
i reiterate to her over and over again that i need a twin bedded room and was assured by 
the rooms are well equiped and toliteries are of good quality 
fantastic views of the sunset or sunrise depending on which side of the building you 're on 
overall not bad and warm friendly feelgood views of marina bay and singapore hotel car is 
very disappointing we had a business breakfast w 42 people and it was appealing how bad the service was . 
best pool 
so '5' for what it is - a terrific property 
and the service is top notch 
i liked the pool which was exactly my type of pool 
an expensive hotel so should be faultless 
it was an excellent stay and shall return soon 
she simply walked past as if i was n't there 
the w 's pool is sizeable with small walkway decks as features 
overall it 's a great resort hotel if you want to spend the money 
it 's good for a walk 
hotel free shuttle service to airport central plaza provided 
which goes to show that this area is a popular area among the foreigners 
the infared sauna made up for it 
the buffet is very good with lots to chose from 
a well equipped gym 
the pool area is spectacular as are most of the public areasnote the wonderful fossils in the bathroomno 
more disappointed as i just stayed in w taipei and the branch in singapore is pale in 
there are several restaurants near the hotel and you can also walk to some attractions like the aquarium 
i 'm a little frustrated on how bad the breakfast is organized 
we enjoyed lazing by the large pool sipping the excellent mojitos from the bar 
the w trademark art decor was superbly done but not over bearing 
the breakfast seating area is adjacent ( outside - although with umbrella shade ) in a very small area beside 
great location & friendly services 
hotel staff helpful 
we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in this area and so many were much more expensive or much 
for once we slept great on our pillows like home 
the breakfast next day was first rate 
on weekends there are pay-&-display parking next to old spaghetti factory ( on 3rd a 
perfect for tourism and if your business takes you to that part of the city -it 's imperative 
rooms ending in 22 are large junior suites 
the prices you can get on the westin website if you stay several days 
this is a great place for a stop-off after a long flight 
one the best airport hotel i have stayed at 
the lobby and the restaurants bars are very nice and the staff is extremely helpful 
food prices are very high but the 4 of us enjoyed the meal with large portions 
it had been a while since i last stayed here as a new airport hotel 
final minor complaint is that they will not put printed receipts under the door in order to be a green 
the airport shuttle was convenient 
also conveniently located by a walkway to south terminal 
maybe with a larger premium cabin which was truly awesome 
free parking 
able to see the surf if turned slightly sideways due to the position & angle of buildingcons-husband 
stayed a sunday night and got a great price 
the staff on check in did not smile and lacked the warmth that we are used to when checking in 
great rooms and amazing views 
it 's not the most modern hotel but it s a fantastic top hotel in abu dhabi 
and position of hotel very good 
for dinner or for drinks you have plenty of options in the hotel compound itself 
the view from the outside seating area was fantastic 
free wifi and complimentary mini hamper 
good location 
the pool area is fantastic with different types of spaces around both the huge pool and the extensive gardens and 
with a strange smell in the corridors and inside the rooms 
i shall just provide some updates since my last visit there 
hotel is close to bugis junction a large shopping mall so it 's convenient 
hotel was showing its age a but but a very good bed and great shower 
the bathroom was excellent with a shower and really nice oval bath 
the woman at the front desk was friendly and very helpful with restaurant recommendations and directions 
we chose a small suite which was a very comfortable size with a separate living room 
average business hotel with a great interior and location 
there are several restaurants around the station and in the adjacent office buildings 
it takes around 5 mins from the hotel the station 
the breakfast and evening reception were average ( no free drink at the evening reception ) 
i will review the hotel first and the restaurants last 
everything you need for a good nights sleep 
internet is not free in the room even with hilton honors membership ( have to be a higher level 
i am strong believer that wi-fi should be free considering that many of the high end hotels like 
with a great executive lounge ( although alcoholic beverages are not free - which i thought was a bit stupid 
all of which are top notch 
the service standard is high and being located next to a subway station is super convenient for getting around town 
convenient location next to major shinagawa station 
cleanliness and nice amenities 
its a consistent hotel with great service and exceptional location next to shinagawa station 
other than to go to the conrad 's private beach ( driven there in their porsche su 
its actually quite small occupying only a few floors of a very tall building 
they have a nice club on the top 2 floors with a great view 
the executive lounge is also very service oriented the wait staff even while seated at the lounge are constantly checking 
swimming pool area was very nice and the kids enjoyed themselves very much 
only on some days there is poolside service of non-alcoholics only 
they are n't date stamped so we used 3 over two days and the day we went to the 
thanks everyone for making our stays with you such an enjoyable experience 
the suite was very comfortable and the quality of the food was delicious - every single one of their restaurants 
an open air new huge shopping mall 
smoking like chimneys making the air totally polluted 
the french bistro on the ground floor had amazing french onion soup 
booking a hotel car back to the airport turned out to be very difficult - you would suppose this 
the lounge managers are very helpful & always attentive to ascertain if their guests are satisfied with the overall experience 
excellent and helpful staffs 
it is great value for money in comparison to other nearby city accomodation 
the late checkout and car were confirmed for 3pm the following day 
there are several restaurants on property that range from family-friendly to up-scale 
use the lift at the office building next door 
the fact that the hotel also has a number ( 9 ) great restaurants just makes it that much better 
the lobby is small and could not accommodate the tour group which was leaving at the time of check in 
hotel is either new or has had a complete refurbishment 
the room was nice - bathroom excellent ( great shower ) 
with great facilities 
nice room on a high floor with a decent view 
the room had two double beds but they were closer to a queen in size and the most comfortable beds 
the hotel has a swimming pool 
the burj khalifa and dubai mall are nearby if shopping is your thing 
when you finally find it on the outside wall it not only lights up the bathroom 
area feels nice and safe 
a short tram ride to the city makes this location excellent for business or pleasure i note that there was 
modern and spacious 
with all the facilities necessary 
i like the24-hour fitness center concept although it only has 2 treadmill and 1 elliptical machines 
public areas and guest rooms are obviously in need of some sprucing up though cleanliness was not 
though with very helpful personnel which we really appreciated 
the rooms are superior and the facilities are great 
the massage quality is so good and price is reasonable 
large tubs and bathrooms 
the call centre thing for all your needs is a bit annoying because everytime you call a different person 
club facilities were closed the last morning of my stay because of ramadan 
a wonderful and quiet paradise away from the busy town 
william and saranga were extremely kind handled our luggage like pros 
i agree the hotel is located on a beautiful property with lush greenery and suited by the golf course 
really great massage 
we were lucky to get a room high up with extensive views 
the bar is great 
all bars offer great range of drinks and always mixed and served with a happy smile 
but they do offer a discount when you check-in for a treatment 
the shuttle bus was easy and took 5 mins - when we missed the return journey we took taxis ( 
our was on the beach with a private patio 
this is a stunning property right on the beach front 
highly recommended . 
walking and hiking trails leaving from hotel are fine 
muffins and they bring you breakfast meats 
room prices are high but value for money is exceptional 
nice toiletries 
great location with spectacular view from all rooms 
excellent restaurants and local attractions 
being able to walk from sentral station to the hotel undercover in less than five minutes makes it a 
we had two rooms and one of the rooms were upgraded to the next category which came from free mini 
the selection of drinks was also better 
water pressure is good but at times the hot water may be irregular 
great value for money too in a a great central location next to kl sentral 
free high speed wifi 
the service was decent 
two power plugs are behind the lcd panel and you ca n't realistically plug on your kettle there 
rooms okay and the breakfast buffet reasonable 
the room was spacious and the amenities are great - i like that they give u takeaway cups in your 
my first stay in aloft 's property during a business trip last week 
the internet was free and fast 
which entitled me to free minibar 
room amenities are good enough for a good night stay 
the hotel is in a very good location 
the location is excellent - within walking distance of the castle 
it was lovely to wander out in the evening and look at the old town bathed in lights 
the breakfast was good 
there are some areas which bothered me during my stay in room 515 which may or may not bother 
there is a bus that runs from right outside the hotel and goes down the hill and right into the 
many plugs available 
the roof top restaurant bar offered amazing views and great food 
do consider staying here if you want to be located next to kl sentral 
roof top pool was the best 
nice lounge with great help 
-complimentary toiletries waiting in your room upon arrival 
it 's on the same floor you got out to connecting door to kl sentral 
the concierge and reception employees were extremely friendly and helpful 
it is a short walk to the funicular which will take you to the foot of the chain bridge 
hotel is contemporary and well suited for families with kids 
right by the train station that goes to the airport 
its location is so strategic you would not want to go elsewhere in kuala lumpur 
the wifi works as advertised and the hotel looks very clean 
the beddings are very comfortable 
this property clientele are mainly young 
very limited wifi 
the restaurant in the main building provides a good buffet dinner and folklore show which involves the guests 
the setting is beautiful 
the char bar on the 30th floor is awesome and i believe one of the best views in sh 
i will review the restaurant separately but buffet breakfast is only average 
the foodin the hotel was very good and the room was comfortable 
with a very good rating for every category the indigo is the first hotel that i 'm rating 
all the usual toiletries and slippers robes were provided including for the first time a gas mask 
bathroom not very clean and shower is almost just dripping 
comfortable bed and nice spacious bathroom area 
the pool was amazing and my little one had fun though she either swan in our arms or we 
good toileteries ( in house spa brands ) bed - lovely bed for a good night 's 
which means you will be eating in the restaurants 
taxis to the town are well priced if you want a night out and ubud town is good 
we stayed in one of the suites on the 28th and really enjoyed the view 
the pool was nice but the water was n't clear at all 
bars and shopping and the staff are just amazing and always so helpful and efficient 
perfectly located hotel with fantastic and genuine staff 
bathroom was also spacious with a good separate shower 
just a 5 minute walk to the venue and the price did not burn a hole in the pocket 
exec lounge was amazing - great food and complimentary beer and wine 
and it was one of the best breakfasts i have had 
the hilton doesnt own the building and there is clearly some serious issues 
a nice touch to be escorted up to the room although more information about hotel and associated benefits could have 
easy parking ) 
the breakfast buffet is comprehensive and of top quality 
overall a very satisfying experience and great staff 
free mini bar and snacks throughout the day and drinks every night on the top floor over looking the ocean 
there also was n't a mini bar so i could n't even pay for bottled water 
all in all great quick getaway 
the snacks late night were tasty 
they have a starbucks inside and a great restaurant called anthems 
great views from higher floors 
and breakfast in concierge level is great as well 
totally avoidable long distance call overseas call to unblock the card 
we usually stay in broadbeach 
only issue is that there 's construction across the street and if you 're in a room facing 
the room was spacious and furnishings very good 
spacious corridors and halls and very pleasant hospitality made of a myriad of little details of spanish flavors 
the pool is excellent 
the room and bathroom excellent and very comfortable 
check -in was smooth and so was check out . 
one down side is water pressure is low 
and did not see any better hotels 
so the gym and pool were small and not up to modern day standard 
( nothing like waking up with the light from the shower shining in your eyes and looking over to see 
the concierge was great 
our luxury room grade was a good size with modern amenities 
the hilton lounge at male is a great start - air conditioned 
the lobster and champagne special dinner on the beach was also very nice 
the hotel gym is very good and the pool is large and offered welcome relief from the heat 
it was great the resort offered a short dive for the non-certified public 
the maldivian gentleman at the main pool who knew by our second day exactly which was my 
the suite was quite large with a comfortable lounge area and large opening windows but the bathroom and soft furnish 
they have a lot of excursions we liked the island hopping one the most ( we got to visit 
i spoke to the front desk via telephone to report these problems ( leaking fridge bathroom sink ) before leaving 
except getting the aircon lower than 25c and that was unable to be done as it 's 
the food generally is very good at all the restaurants and you can have australian fillet steak 
the hotel is a lush oasis but more than this is the way they do service - they arranged 
the rooms are luxurious 
which incidentally set us back around 700usd so not cheap but still gave you the impression of good 
a great hotel spoiled by little things in service that linger with you after your stay 
the hotel took upon itself all the details that made our visit here unforgettable 
breakfast at both the club lounge and restaurant was fantastic . 
although they will send a golf cart to pick you up or you can take the boat from one island 
tv was pretty small and not flatscreen 
we even got a free upgrade to a junior suite which offers a lot of space and two bathrooms 
we decided to make one last trip 
this is a really nice resort in a quiet area of seminyak but only a 10m walk 
it made a difference when at 9pm there was no way to book any form of transport to any 
and there were some really nice touches in the room 
our room was based around a curved wall - and the furniture and bedroom layout didnt really fit 
really nice breakfast 
the rooms at fire & ice are very small and extremely average 
- my colleague left me an important message at the front desk because you cant leave voice mails 
but with a highly efficient use of space 
apparently word had got out it was our wedding anniversary and the sofitel had arranged an upgrade 
breakfast buffet was great 
we enjoyed the nice suite and the club-lounge with breakfast 
we used the shower chair as an extra 'shelf' for toiletry bags but if 
concierge very knowledgeable 
the internet was weak and i had to stand near the door to get a wi-fi signal from 
they also had a small range of free dvds for guest use ( very useful if 
a previous reviewer claimed the hotel refreshes your room with chocolates daily 
the coffee house is near the pool serving great breakfast with many choices in accordance to radisson 's 
the staff was very helpful and efficient 
we liked the indoor gardens and barramundi in the pool 
the hanging pendent light fittings 
and as usual the bathroom was pathetically small to the us standards 
they have a great gym with new equipment 
the pool was not huge but it was nice and deep and the perfect temperature to cool down after a 
the atrium is beautiful and the whole environment is peaceful 
taxi to from airport is about s 25 
the hotel is a roughly circular design around a central rainforest inspired courtyard 
i have stayed at over 40 four seasons hotels and resorts over the last 20 years and helen stands 
hotel staff was very friendly and always helpful 
we also ate dinner one night at coya right next to the hotel that was excellent 
the radisson brunei is a very clean and comfortable hotel that is located well for exploring the 
really recommend a seaview room and if you are n't a night owl ask to be away 
beautiful indoor spa 
we ordered room service and the food was so delicious and the room service guy was so professional and present 
the bed was n't to our backs pleasures but i am sure other people like the firmness of 
trendy shops all within a few miles 
you ca n't do better in this city 
white linens 
the concierge was n't that great either 
the location is superb and kelapa gading mall one of the biggest and best malls in j 
i would specifically commend two gentlemen at the front desk that have big smiles on their faces always 
the lobby had free wifi 
there are many hotels around lax area and it was just like a tourist area 
i recently stayed here for one night 
plenty of restaurants and the shopping looked great 
i requested a room overlooking the airport which was nice to see planes landing and taking off 
the parlor room had a flat-panel tv while the bedroom had a standard tube tv 
the location is ideal if your flight leaves very early in the morning 
expensive internet 
the room is quite nice for an airport hotel 
the staff is friendly though and lobby is nicely done 
the suite room has a nice seating area and extremely large bath 
food and beverage options are also great 
smooth seamless checkout the next morning 
drinks ( non alcoholic ) are free in lounge however beer - wine and drinks are to be paid 
as you the park is right outside and the swimming pool is not overcrowded 
good location 
if you are not a frequent visitor to lax 
there was a great omelette station 
it will be next to the mechanical room which you will hear 24 7 
good airport shuttle that 's easy to catch and runs late early for those needing to make connections 
the bathroom was large 
i wish i had brought my swimwear because the pool looked amazing 
the front desk staff was unsympathetic and totally refused our request 
franchisees of a well-known fitness club had a splendid party in a marquee mere feet 
and directed me to the front desk to my left 
good restaurtant and some dishes a good value for money which is difficult to find in singapore 
bathroom spacious with nice free standing bath tub 
the pillows were great and the view was wonderful 
the rooms were possibly the most pleasant we have stayed in on our many travels - everything in there was 
it 's a nice area but every evening we were there it was packed with locals office workers and 
love the history element of it being the old police station 
the bathroom had a separate tub and shower ( not in all room types ) and plenty of space 
all room doors close with a great crashing noise unless held back by the guest so do n't be 
the hotel rooms are comfortable and the service good 
the lounge is small but a very good spot to relax away from crowds when you are away from home 
the only thing i did n't like was the very slow elevators 
lovely indoor pool area in the hotel 
the hotel is located in the city entree yet in an alley that eliminates the buzz of a c 
this hotel is in a great location 
most shops restaurants here not open or have restricted hours sat & sunday 
professional staff and room service dinner superb 
we were on the 4th floor however the room was in a quiet part of the hotel and no 
which should be standard in the room 
a couple days in boston wow what 's a great view of the city from our suite . 
the lobby was huge and often very crowded 
it was a good size 
fabulous location and facility got to the hotel around noon and found my room ready . 
the breakfast was excellent value and the charr restaurant serves top class meals 
ask for upper floor as the tram-line construction on george st tend to happen in the middle 
the facade is a shell 
excellent wifi 
the spa is nice but there were a few minor mis-steps there 
the staff are very friendly and the room was well appointed with a very spacious bathroom with separate bath and 
do n't look to your left as thats the industrial area 
in the end we complained to the front desk and they took the charges off 
awesome breakfast buffet and happy hour 
pool and spa available 
fresh orange juice 
friendly team of hotel staffs 
stayed here for one night was totally enjoyablewe stayed on the executive level and enjoyed use of the 
the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was well appointed 
the actual hotel lobby and bar is also dated and the downstairs toilets are also quite run down for a 
examples -- the opening ceremonies were being shown on a tv in the bar and the tv suddenly shut 
you will enjoy the nice setting and the view into the green 
good size bathroom and all the touches you 'd expect in a premium 4 
reported to reception on our checkout who did n't make any comment or apologies which was poor2 ) 
the room upgrade was great and we could use the executive lounge as platinum accor member 
executive lounge ok 
the lounge was fine and the food plentiful 
the staff were always friendly and helpful 
rose on front desk is an absolute star 
the thala beach nature reserve is an outstanding deluxe resort in its own private grounds with 2 km 
excellent boutique hotel 
in very easy walking distance of the centre of the city 
this is a fantastic resort 
but dont worry as you only have to ring reception for some one to come and collect you in a 
and high quality 
this may be because we usually get a room on the top floors 
as it is next to a small shopping village 
would have liked to have enjoyed the hotel 's facilities - a decent sized lap pool on the 4 
2 nights in xian and the last 3 nights in shanghai 
the lobby is basic but ok for all sorts of travellers 
it 's a shame that in italy one has to eat such food when you know there is 
the spa and swimming pool very good and the gym too 
breakfast was below average and it was a 4 star sheraton 
the property is lovely 
across the road is the ritz carlton roof top bar which is a great place to 
naturally we refused to pay and the fresh orange juice was grudginly produced 
the most famous luxury hotel in this great city 
the rooms are small and the thing that we did n't like also was that the bathroom door can 
take a short walk 
lobby is extremely small 
it is evidently frequented by many middle easterners , and there is a table with specialities 
comfortable and friendly with a good breakfast 
tea was a good bet as the staff kept this constantly topped up whereas coffee appears limited to the 
decoration in the main cafe is really nice ( including aquariums and more ) 
good bed 
with jumeirah brand you expect first class service and extremely friendly staff - and that is what 
the hotel room was fantastic we have a superb view of the oriental pearl tower 
the room was very clean with the usual quality bathroom amenities that you expect from the shangri la 
however was disappointed with an extra 180 charge to the bill when we reached 
very good dining options on premise 
it is very nice to have a drink in your room and enjoy it 
make sure you upgrade to horizon lounge the staff are so friendly my new fav hotel fantastic 
they are very generous with their locitanne soaps but not bottled water which we use it to 
especially those attending the exhibition centre adjacent to it 
rent a car and get a room with a balcony so you can enjoy the beautiful florida sun 
the lockers and wet area were a mess ( waste bins running over 
and the pepper market serves the worst food in a setting that would make any college mess hall look wonderful 
in that the price was reasonable 
the shangri-la pudong is one of the top 5-star hotels in fast 
we had to get a room switched at 11pm on night one for a critters in the room 
we were in the smaller tower floor 12 - so not much of a view but the room was nice 
we had free wifi which was fantastic 
children loves big pool with sand and slides 
tired furniture 
stunning groundclean beachgood breakfastservice excellent except 1 lady at receptionbig clean size roomgood pool 
the spa was very realxing and there are lots of activies to do too 
my previous visits i stayed at pool villa with ocean view and it was extraordinary 
the hot spring water is the perfect temperature and there are a variety of different onsen pools to choose 
food quality is great 
'french' restaurant tried hard to duplicate haute cuisine european style but didnt really manage 
private villas 
the room quite old but it was comfortable and good sleep 
defenitely one of the best hotels i 've ever been to 
was given a smoking non-club room 
nice ambiance 
it was a decent sized gym 
got in at 6am and had to pay 1 2 day for super early check in 
has a great pool ( 2 actually ) and the food is excellent 
will definitely go back as it was very good value 
looked out over a low roof and air-conditioning unit 
nice room and very nice bathroom which was cleaned twice a day 
none of this was necessary but greatly appreciated 
liked the shower pressure and the efficiency in cleaning the room every morning 
zero view but the interior was spacious with separate living area and a large bedroom with comfy pillows 
roof top bar has an awesome view of ponte vecchio and the arno river 
the rooftop deck bar is awesome at the end of the day at dusk 
for a really nice dinner or lunch 
the location of this hotel is truly perfect ( although the one way streets and restrictions getting threr are 
super cozy with nice bedding and a cute balcony 
but what is cheap in florence ( except public transportation to fiesole ) 
they should shut the top floor 
beautiful hotel it 's a beautiful hotel in city centre right in the middle of shopping district and 
cosmopolitan hotel in great location 
never a problem with street noise and the blackout blinds had it perfectly dark 
the staffs are friendly and helpful 
there is also a post office across from the isetan side of the station and more shopping nearby 
the front desk staff is very efficient 
very good position opposite the major train station in kyoto and also near the main bus depot and 
ice machine and soft drink vending machine - literally outside the station - opposite side to buses we stayed because 
( a nice touch ) 
rooms are reasonable size for japan though bathroom is still quite small 
located next to kyoto station 
i got upgraded to the suite using the hilton discounted upgrade which i think is a smart and great 
because of my gold status we were upgraded to an executive level floor and had access to the lounge - 
the biggest positive - the hotel is conveniently located right across the kyoto train station 
very long waiting for breakfast as there are by far not enough places for the guests 
the front desk staff is pretty skeletal and took forever to get to someone 
restaurant and bars are fine and the hotel is a western style 
a good business hotel in the centre of sydney 
the staff very friendly but unfortunately spoke a very bad english 
we arrived after a long flight from taiwan at 9 
we expect to pay 50 or so as parking is at a premium in sf 
exec lounge is very good and probably the best i have seen in this chain 
a bit on the small side but the hilton revamp has done a good job making good use 
very nice toiletries 
although if you want hot food you need to go downstairs ( no need with the selection that is present 
breakfast is fantastic and has a lovely yogurt bar 
with the drink version and the grab and go 
ask for high floor 
i booked this hotel very last minute on spg website becuase one of the night ( sat 
high floor with a view of the bay and the trans america building 
the breakfast buffet was excellent and i have no problem paying extra for real coffee but 5 extra for pepper 
a very uncomfortable chaise longue which meant the two of us had to use the separate chairs to 
this is my favorite business hotel to stay pretty much anywhere 
the windows were the narrow type - hard to enjoy any view the windows were so small and did n 
breakfast spread is healthy with freshly squeezed juices 
the hotel does not have an executive floor and we went for breakfast at their main restaurant 
the new executive lounge is excellent with nice views 
airport link train takes you town hall station which is only about 100 meters from the hotel ( you 
only down side is the staff a front desk with limited english and no willingness to serve you 
complimentary fruit baskets etc 
this hotel has 2 pools 
the rooms were small they would be fine for a business traveller but not families 
but when finally did i was very impressed and now stay there on frequent visits to sydney 
the breakfast buffet was crowded but there was room enough for everyone to sit wherever you wanted 
staff performance is excellent , and despite the check in problem , i do enjoy the stay here 
he made our trip worth it and gave us fantastic non touristy recos 
this hotel is just great 
separate lounge and bedroom and complete with two toilets 
very clean and spacious 
it is in the middle of the city so you dont feel the sense of privacy because you face another 
i am a fan of the hilton chain having spent some very enjoyable stays in kuala lumpur 
good but there are better for the price 
check out the basement marble bar fantastic atmosphere 
the first room the bathroom was so small you could not even store your toothbrush 
with a roof top pool 
we liked the stylish but very functional room 
which is a city without great hotels 
innovative food and gorgeous bars 
bathrooms nice and beds inviting 
got a nice king suite with a very large bathroom 
but you have cafes and restaurants nearby 
same funky concept of baby w hotel . 
we chose here mainly due to the fact that we need to catch an early morning train and this is 
extremely comfortable bed and a comfortable couch 
the bathroom was a good size and the shower was adequate in size and pressue 
covered carpark comes free and if you pre-paid online then checkout is a breeze 
but shower over spa was a water saving type and the water pressure and volume was greatly reduced 
walls are very thin 
we went down to the front reception and obtained new keys as this we thought was the problem 
large rooms with spa bath 
the standard accommodation will benefit 
- disconnect between their twitter team and the rest of the staff ( we had asked if we could get 
the front desk was very welcoming 
regular shuttle to t1 and walking distance to the sydney train station at the domestic airport 
the gym was adequate with a fair number of machines and free weights 
a final item to point out is the the building can sway like most in san francisco and high 
the rooms are clean and the bedding is excellent 
great electronic and room features and fantastic bed 
the front desk check in person then generously offered us an upgrade to a higher floor deluxe room - 
breakfast was great but the appies and desserts in the evening always ran out within about 1 2 
no complaints about the room and the furniture comfortable as well 
several young men having coffee near the hotel entrance witnessed my struggles and came to our assistance 
even though this hotel is next to the airport and aircrafts are departing or arriving basically all the time 
probably with so many amazing hotels in sf 
opted for downtown and the grand hyatt as i 'm a hyatt platinum card holder 
the shower was in a bathtub and the buffet breakfast was small and weak 
our room was spacious with king bed and good sized bathroom 
restaurant breakfast buffet is average but expensive 
the staff are helpful and the location is very good

great sunday brunch and pool we ahve been to the shangrila at sentosa a 
i checked in on a monday at 10am for executive panoramic room and i received an 
the bed was very comfortable and included feather pillows and nice sheets 
the sentosa shangri-la is blessed with having a beautiful beach setting 
) interesteing choice that there is no mini bar in room 
very busy and the rooms are very small 
i was able to take advantage of the spa and had a very good massage 
huge pool but very shallow and busy with lots of kids 
the room is quite neat and aiming at keeping everything as perfect as possible 
had to shorten our stay there 
good sized bedroom with 2 double beds 
a water play area and children 's pool was also great 
a very long walk if you had a tiring day out on the city 
rooms are large by roman standards and beds comfortable though the aircon machine was noisy 
the hotel has a small bar area with finger food 
the hotel also has free wi-fi and a busines center with 2 computeres with free internet 
only problem was getting a taxi on the morning i left - finally convinced concierge to order one 
the hotel is rather discreet however a lovely entrance and welcome 
shops and the park 
the resort restaurants were ok and the pools were alright 
the reason i did not give it 5 stars is because the staff at the front desk could not speak 
all in all a brilliant hotel one of the best in singapore 
good shower 
sea view & high floor 
while the gardens are as lovely and well maintained as ever things inside the hotel are not operating up to 
there is an amazing kids club and tons of activities for adults and kids 
the villas are exceptionally well maintained and the staff is quite good 
the swimming pool is nice 
my husband and i took our deck chairs to a grassed area away from the pool which afforded a 
the pool area was excellent with lots of loungers

the bathroom was large and included a full bathtub and separate shower area 
comfortable beds and pillows 
the beach right in front of the hotel is ok 
also a nice bar and a really good breakfast buffet 
the pool is great fun 
there are other much nicer options in hua hin 
with no space to sit around the hilton pool we took to the public beach in front of the 
but what made this hotel special was the staff 
on a nice beach 
we were in the grand suite and was a great room 
they offered light snacks and drinks throughout the day 
historic hotel and marvelous ambience 
we really enjoyed walking around and the location was perfect 
the concierge was very attentive and have delivered our demanding requests 
because i encountered some high management around the lobby as one of them actually greeted me 
the hotel maria christina in san sebasti n is a fine luxury hotel with all 
it 's a pity that as a guest staying clublevel you do n't get wifi throughout the 
decent size 
the service and general cleanliness is good and pool and distance from the road make for reasonably peaceful relaxation 
yangon does n't have as much to offer the tourist like mandalay & bagan do 
bar prices are very expensive 
every night we were there they had a large function outside by the pool with loud music - this did 
it was one of the privately owned apartments 
the rooms are very modern and comfortable 
the single shower stall was quite dirty with blackened wet stains on the floor 
the rooms are large ( bathroom 's huge jacuzzi was too big 
this is a huge hotel in myanmar standards 
dimm lighting in room not practical 
breakfast was very good and the bar restaurant really nice too 
given sp 's notoriously bad traffic 
tennis court and hotel specific landscaping ) are highway and industrial complex 
- front desk staff was completely disinterested in there jobs 
the chatrium is one of the larger business hotels in yangon and whilst the prices have shot 
but bangkok garden across from the hotel entrance is a fine thai restaurant 
if you feel like the food is to expensive you can walk across the street and have some wonderful 
the lobby is similar to any four star hotel 
mattress is so hard and pillows are 100 made from polyester and are so hard that 
concierge lounge was nicely stocked 
but it still was no where near being a nice temperature for such heavy bed linens 
there is a good pool and gym for those who need their exercise and 
not that near the airport and rather expensive 
service at the pool was excellent and again the staff were always attentive and cheerful 
perfect location in stratford ( london ) 
good accommodations 
the rooms were odor free and the a c was easy to operate and kept the room cool at night 
the resort itself is an escape from the bustle of siem reap 
after lots of sightseeing every day around the captivating temples in and around angkor wat and 
nice pool 
the restaurant was excellent with a good quality menu and excellent service and staff 
we stayed here for 2 nights prior to a tour 
after a busy time touring in vietnam and cambodia with very confronting and sad images 
great eateries near by had a room on the city side but you do n't spend much time 
hotel has new very modern lobby 
we had some difficulty with check in and were immediately upgraded to a suite which was beautiful and spacious 
2 great bars 
decent hotel in good location 
the beds were a bit hard for us and the room was not light-tight 
the food and staff at the main restaurant lobby bar are excellent 
there 's a duty free shopping mall about 3-5 mins walk from the hotel ( we later 
great breakfast at the main restaurant and a nice place for evening drinks at the the bar as well

i highly would recommend the all inclusive package 
i am totally unhappy that just days before i leave for my vacation , i have to deal with 
mercure is very conveniently located 5 mins walk from susukino subway ( around 50 mins from 
room good value for money and very comfortable 
check staff made us wait an hour to check in 
rooms on the higher floors are quieter 
superbly comfortable beds and very quiet 
salford and we were equally happy on this visit 
the wifi connection was slow and the staff known this because they mentioned about it when checking in 
the suite was very nice -- understated elegance and it seems that a deluxe suite is the same 
i booked the hotel under the 4x bonus points promotion and the points posted only in regular points so 
and the front desk 
suskino is the main restaurant and entertainment district and few blocks from ramen alley 
difficult to get taxis from hotel 
lots of great hotels on orchard road that gives better service and price is all around the same 
- the wedding cake was beautifully done with fresh fruits and tasty - pretty dark dressing light and the window 
housekeeping failed to replenished complimentary drinking water for the suite 
it does not have a huge lobby with high ceilings 
however the average good quality is good 
i asked for a late checkout and this was happily obliged 
excellent business hotel excellent service . 
though bathroom is clean 
very clean and the bed was very comfortable 
the bathrooms are a bit dated and could use a makeover and better cleaning 
excellent service and beautiful hotel 
i could have done better with a dry grilled chicken breast 
it has a modern library feel with plenty of wood and plush seating 
you will need at least 200 hk dollars to buy your train ticket to central hong kong 
plenty of superior hotels in sg and for the price its hard to choose this hotel 
a pleasant hotel with nice enough rooms 
the rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds and pillows and bathrooms clean and well equipped 
and lots of interesting touches 
it is also lower costs than some other hotels nearby 
worth a visit or two 
the area is a bit industrial ( next to an oil refinery & the phuket port ) 
stay here a few times now and wanted to give it another try as my last visit was not that 
the signage is ancient and does n't make any sense 
nice hotel is lovely setting 
with a good menu option 
good facilities and decent sized rooms 
to all the popular beaches like patong 
neither is perfect for sightseeing 
the food on offer was excellent and the attentive staff were incredibly warm 
the club lounge service was excellent as was summer palace the chinese restaurant 
for a city like santiago 
great swimming pool upstairs and the gym facilities are top of the line 
we liked this part of town as a more shiny and new and upmarket contrast to the rest 
i am an starwood preferred guest and i will return but they need to improve this kind of details 
excellent property with great location for shopping 
great option to stay in santiago with nothing to whinge about and very reasonably priced for what 
the cooked dishes were interesting but the peruvian idea of squirting mayonnaise all over the sushi 
congratulations for a great team 
they helped arrange an additional airport transfer at the last minute at no extra charge 
another good touch is the sojourn tuk tuk guarantee 
good property in a good location 
we strongly recommend you hire lim for this purpose at a much more reasonable price 
with a straight run to the airport if you are travelling lightly 
rooms are quite spacious as the bathroom 
check in is fast and hassle free 
it has a beautiful entrance and lobby 
high floor will give you the best views 
the carpets worn 
delish breakfast buffet with crepes and fresh coconut juice standouts 
the club interncontinental private lounge has a nice selection of tibits and drinks which you can ordered 
this hotel accommodates big groups and that is why we did not try breakfast there 
very spacious too and great facilities 
room is spacious with one king comfortable bed 
and also a nice small pool on the 37th floor with beautiful views of bangkok 
afternoon high tea and evening happy hour at the 37th floor lounge are usual happenings 
if you walk out of the hotel you are immediately in the mall where you can have lunch 
it is located right in the middle of everything so an easy walk to shops 
the hotel lobby is very clean and well laid out 
the location is right next to the mall 
good for an overnight stay and has a good bar and restaurant if you do not want to go out 
a 45 minute taxi ride from the airport and an elevated railway station is barely five minutes walk away 
room internet was fast but no wifi except at the lobby 
the room was clean with nice furniture 
a rather dated property that has seen many renovations and changes - but 
which is exactly the same room 
great hotel and excellent service 
the club lounge is excellent and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable

the lounge is great 
great locationbeautiful hotel 
super super service 
great pool 
very old interior rooms 
the gym was a little small but they have a great pool 
the lounge was pleasant and quiet 
a bit old ( esp the toilets ) but the bed was comfortable and good for sleepit was winter 
we also used public transportation - the walk to the closest mtr station takes 10-15 minutes 
it is a short taxi ride 
the complimentary shuttle service to meguru station is wonderful 
there is a convenient shuttle bus service to narita airport 
hotel is clean and size is good in singapore standard 
clean room and wonderful shower 
be prepared for very old but extremely efficient trains 
the girls at the club lounge are super nice and give a warm and welcoming feeling 
at the same price 
internet wifi is free in the rooms and lobby 
the beds are very firm and have clean and fresh linens 
this hotel is conveniently located near the city 's airport and has everything a traveller needs 
as always we got nicely upgraded to a high floor two room 
well furnished room and a superb buffet breakfast 
this might not be the best oocation as it is a traffic area what i love the most is 
i have platnium membership of the priority club so was well pleased when i got an upgrade plus 
i have stayed here several times when on business visits to kl 
beautiful interior and large space in the lobby and room 
the gym is modern and has a good range of equipment and the changing rooms have a wonderful hot stone 
the gym is great and the sauna fantastic 
the bath was all marble and the separate shower had excellent water pressue-possibly the best i have 
then i got very frustrated and went to the front desk 
unfortunately i cannot say the same for breakfast 
there are other better options in shanghai for hotels in this category price range 
the gym was compact but fine and i had a good nights sleep 
parking is in the shopping mall attached but not directly connected so a pain to get bags etc in 
the room was on the 8th floor and great views to the north of the city 
the bar area was pleasant and the plasma screens are ideal for the football 
this hotel is across the street from renowned shopping malls like pavilion 
bukit bintang is like 5 mins walk away so you can see the great location this 
the bed was great 
my third visit to the hotel because of its convenient location to shopping offerings and a variety of good restaurants 
our room had beautiful views 
the pool and hot tub were also nice 
hot pool 
i hung around the lobby like a bad smell waiting for a room 
i 'm paying 45 for this slow internet service 
decor in the breakfast room is a littled dated but very extensive choice of hot & cold 
attached to the convention center and beautiful views of the bay 
) in executive lounge was one of the greatest i ever experienced 
nice bar area but typically expensive pricesgood gym and sauna areavery professional staff 
this was remedied by opening the windows 
this hotel is perfect if you have a cruise as the cruises leave and come back there 
the room was nicely decorated with lovely fluffy bathrobes and a chaise lounge in the window overlooking 
you can access the nearby convention center and the tunnel that goes under the street to a pretty good- 
not only the hotel but also the location is unique for this place 
in the hotel there are nice 
loved the pool and sauna - wonderful on a nice sunny day 
chinatown and shopping but if you are a big shopper you need a taxi sometimes to get back 
costs next to nothing to get a cab to the park gate at which point the hotel run a 
and there is the comfort with huge and deep beds 
and the staff ( especially in the poolside restaurant ) were fantastic 
the spa was very nice and i had a rainforest experience which was lovely 
both breakfast and dinner served by the pool offered great selections and were first class 
definitely worth the price as you save lots of time and money being in the middle of the park 
it is however inside the national park iguazu and this means you get to do the falls 
kota the japanese butler sure loved his work 
allowing 2 people to take up multiple tables 
served in a lovely breakfast room 
the hotel has plenty of facilities and is a true first class hotel 
great value great choices 
is settled just in front of this wonder of the nature inside the parque nacional do ig 
the bed was excellent 
luxury in the midst of a national park 
it basically gives u unlimited access to the falls at anytime that u feel like it 
as the rooms are larger 
expect a single tiny cup of coffee delivered to your room 
the restaurants were full of gemans eating schnitzel and listening to bethoven 
my suggestion is to stay there and stop by the cateras for a drink or an expensive lunch 
all are of good quality 
our room was big and comfortable 
the hotel 's concierge are very helpful and can help you book some exciting excursions 
some of the more expensive rooms will have views of the falls 
hotel is like a resort with great swimming pool and spa and the food is exceptional . 
room decoration space amenities all excellent 
my very demanding and spoiled model wife was very happy with all the light and healthy low-cal options 
we stayed two nights and had a fantastic time and wished we had another to be able to spend some 
the hotel staff were extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome from the start 
this hotel is properly managed 
i thought i would give the property a second chance to see if that was a one-off 
nice to walk ) and is a nice walk 
with a great bathroom 
the bed is probable the beys and super comfortable with the pillow also very good 
it was a good experienced but not really value-to-monry 
breakfast offer various range of food local and international 
the bed was excellent with a nice comfy mattress 
very thoughtful as well by providing cubicles outside to make calls 
the decor is as good as the grand hyatt singapore 's straits cafe 
the fresh juice counter was welcoming 
great stay awesome service 
it was just too many of them added together to make this trip memorable 
big bathrooms 
the hotel staff was excellent and helped us to utilize the few hours as good as possible 
room is big with 2 double beds 
breakfast spread was good with variety 
the internet was a good speed and having the router in the room 
stay away from first floor even if they upgrade you 
the cafe had a great spread and variety of food choices over breakfast and dinner daily 
and the hotel staff informed that we could ask as many as we needed for no additional charges 
location - this is about 15 minutes from the jb central terminal and causeway to singapore by 
stayed here for one night as is close to the airport 
being in the royal beach club puts you a bit far away from the main building 
the beach , like almost all the beach in cancun is quite nice , and the property 
we had very early flight 
from the other reviews you do hear sirens but thankfully our room was not facing the street and would 
good and clean room 
imperial palace and main areas 
be aware that coffee in your room is not free and will incur a charge 
you can always leave the key with the front desk when going out 
service was definitely 5 star and the breakfast buffet was excellent 
the room was spacious and comfortable although i did detect some smoke staleness despite booking a non smoking room 
this hotel is excellent for the value 
everything is electrically controlled by a switch from lighting to blinds with even settings for night lighting and 
the decor was very modern 
the only real drawback is there are very few inexpensive restaurants in the area 
tastefully decorated and will all of the added extras that you could want 
proximity to the world trade center and many good restaurants are a plus 
overall i liked staying here and it definitely met the needs of my visit which was business 
bar has an excellent selection of beers and good food offerings 
overpriced and lacks its former shine while the ambience remains the service and quality do not justify the 
the decor was modern and the bed was comfortable 
it was located quite centrally and was within short walking distance to everything that we needed 
clean and modern rooms 
if you are lucky there is a second airport 
a solid business hotel 
asian buffet breakfast is available at the atrium ground floor 
breakfast buffet was one of the best i have ever experienced 
the location is good the rooms are big and comfortable 
the speed is quite slow and with certain parts of hotel has no connection 
which could be converted to an extra bed 
the staff were attentive and the food was good 
the spa was very professional and i enjoyed the 3 therapies that i opted for 
higher up floors less affected by wedding 
ordered the 30 usd budapest breakfast and was a bit overwhelmed by the endless plates of average quality 
good food and all the sights nearby 
before i left the front desk 
because of the currency differences it worked out as good value for my 
many shops and restaurants nearby 
the lounge is large 
the fresh orange juice is worth a mention 
nice stay . 
the size of the washroom also is extremely boutique and tiny 
the rooftop pool was not open but the view from the pool area overlooking the acropolis was stunning 
when we complained we received a very hostile reception but a better room albeit still on 2nd floor so 
the three restaurants provided a vast variety of food 
this is a very well located hotel 
it has two meeting rooms plus one conference room for use by club room guests with the first two hours 
not far from schiphole airport but the shuttle bus stops at several hotels and it takes about 15 
you are in the nice restaurants of plaka 
egg and ham with coffee is a nice start of a day 
the view is great but the terrace gives no privacy as it 's joint by other rooms 
good views west with lots of large window space 
the rate was quite a good value for downtown vancouver and the room was spacious 
i did not like the 3 waste bins for recycle in the middle of the roomthe room is large 
there is better hotels out there and this hotel isnt in the best area and there isnt alot 
the issues were minor though and for the most part the hotel is an excellent choice to easily explore la 
expensive parking ( 24 a day was the most i had to pay in 3 weeks in the us ) 
the bed was comfortable but the pillows were all quite firm and high 
the bistro cafe was very good and the waiting staff were very helpful 
modern decor 
awesome and great value 
the bedding is very comfortable 
nice view if you get a high floor 
hotel 's attached to the mall 
close to all the museums and there are plenty of restaurants in the area for dinner 
the hotel reception is very stark modern as is the whole hotel 
the decor is a little off and some elements make it feel like a refurbished ramada 
the room was huge and very comfortable 
a nice touch 
i think the hotel must remember that the group were in-house guest and were not some ordinary fans 
we have stayed in other 5 star and the service was much better 
breakfast was very good but pricey but the real let down was the time it took me to check 
please offer a second set of cutlery after the sandwiches and have little spoons or similar for 
and have good bathroom separate shower and small tub 
a number of good restaurants nearby as well as transport connections 
one can count on her to work her magic and provide you with the best room possible 
great rooms with comfy beds and super nice staff 
le bar right by the entrance i found a great place to people watch 
some complain about the high cost of parking at hotels and lots in downtown chicago 
and small couch and coffee table 
very comfortable and overall 
upon finding out that the room is actually occupied we came back to the reception where i was asked to 
be aware that the hotel has no restaurant 
the lobby is an excellent photo-op for the out-of-town-- not to be missed 
however it was a feeding frenzy at 7am ( corporate group ) so some dishes were empty and 
see everyone enjoying themselves at the bar or just lounging around 
the hotel is located up the hill from the very convenient shinagawa station and the stores and restaurants 
the elevators can be slow during rush hours 
not right in town 
fantastic public areas 
rooms are a good size for tokyo 
we used the hotel 's parking arrangement at 55 e monroe st garage 
they upgraded me to a terrace room due to being platinum member with marriott 
on the same block of the hotel is a restaurant called millers pub 
elegant public spaces that draw you in 
the rooms were odor free and had plenty of room to move about 
big rooms with smallish bathrooms and quite dated and in need of upkeep 
we had been given a critical room assignment on the executive floorin a suite with an additional room next 
the pool was small and the atmosphere was not nice 
small and no wifi in room 
while i was doing this my wife was trying to check our bags since the rooms were not ready 
that all sounds a bit too critical - this was a good hotel - at a great price 
if you are ever in santiago de compostela the hotel is a must stay 
it just misses some charm and the service could be faster 
excellent modern interior of the lobby 
thankfully the windows can be opened 
the buffet breakfast was generous and well-staffed ( unlike the experience of others and unlike our subsequent 
rooms are good sized 
bit noisy from traffic next to main road5 
bread and some local dishes like watery congee 
the bed was one to dream in 
the manager is very nice and customer oriented 
the restaurant for lunch or dinner was very good & did not charge exhorbitant prices like most 
what a charming boutique hotel in a fantastic location 
the hotel manager was very keen to ensure we were satisfied and the measure of the hotels customer service was 
service and appointments were all good as was the breakfast ( though pricey ) 
we got a good nights sleep each night due to a comfortable bed and pillows and a lack of 
some grand hotels rest on their reputations 
certainly one of the best hotels in vienna combining charm 
had a full tub and shower with excellent water pressure 
not close to past omni hotels we 've stayed at for condition 
the room was huge and very beautifully furnished with a super comfortable king bed and a wonderful bathroom with a 
but usually it was worth the wait 
the room was excellent and faced onto the garden areas 
there are separate sauna and steam rooms by the pool as there were steam rooms in the changing areas 
( the tradeoff is instead to be at the beach with two large pools 
the hotel staff are really nice and friendly however the hotel needs an update to bring it in line with 
cozy bar 
high ceilings and a small lounge outside the bedroom 
the views are spectacular and worthy of a leisurely lunch 
the property is magical and the staff top notch 
you 'd think that a chain hotel like the crowne would get there wi-fi in order 
the smells on the floor were wet and curry cooking 
pleanty of room good bathroom pleanty of hot water nice breakfast room 
the property is new 
had small table and chairs for meals 
minimal traffic noise on the 7th floor 
very nice resort in dubai 
the staff were very attentive 
the hot options were unappetising 
but the problem in the main pool still remained almost the same 
but a quick whizz in a taxi into the city proper 
there 's a nice big double bed and bathroom is good size with very nice comfortable towels 
the main building is hotel 
staff at the main reception were efficent and very friendly and could not fault their service at all 
since it was very busy at the hotel we even received an upgrade to a beautiful flat with living room 
there was also a patio with access to the beautiful grounds that we walked around 
were a nice touch 
lovely welcome and given a complimentary upgrade 
the room was very well appointed with pretty good accessories and excellent views 
nice people and bad food 
i stayed at a prestigious beach front hotel in cannes for half the price which makes the sense of 
there were free bits of beach or you could pay about 14 euro to use one of the two beach 
the location is really good 
the hotel bar had an outside area that many locals seemed to enjoy 
on the edge of monaco with reliable marriott service 
easy access to the airport and the highway 
but with a nice spa alongside 
the resort is an oasis of peace and luxury outside the backpacker 's chaos of byron 
great beach 
the pool attendant would come to check on you ( by name ) every half an hour to bring some 
open dining and breakfasting area with good asian fusion food 
lunch by the pool was delicious highly recommend the chicken salad 
warm welcomes and worn out couches 
the beach is a little bit of a walk away but as it 's 7km long 
the food in the restaurant served great food 
fantastic high class resort typical of four seasons with amazing service 
we found the staff particularly on the front desk and concierge very responsive and thoughtful 
the pool was large and had a great view 
it does get very quiet in the area in the weekend 
old bath tub , old ceramics , old style , really not what you expect from such 
staff is frienfly except of the breakfast one 
but a reasonable spread all the same 
the new serenity pool was great - we got a kick out of the underwater music 
very spacious bathroom 
good service and nice environment 
the water pressure was very low for the hand shower but ok for overhead rainforest shower 
very new and less than 1 km from 2 large shopping malls ( city square and jbcc ) 
the dinner is a bit sub-standard 
outside of cocktail hour the only snacks available where chips and nuts in a large bowl 
i would definitely stay there again on business 
the rectangular kiddie pool itself is 18 inches deep 
the executive lounge on the 7th floor is a real bonus and well worth the upgrade 
rooms are good size and very functional 
it works much better in the lobby 
sweets and savories could make up a light dinner if you eat enough of them 
be prepared for a hot walk 
there 's free wifi in the public areas which is great if you are hanging at the bar 
there is a basement walkway to the seoul station and you can get to anywhere from there 
the bad- lobby restaurant area is open 
taxi drivers have little knowledge of the location of the hotel as it only occupies the upper floors of 
good night sleep is possible besides the major construction work currently going on 
with its own dedicated entrance 
only thing that is annoying is that you have insert the key when you enter your room to power the 
club lounge area was generally quiet 
ambient noise from seoul station and the street below can be heard 
it is a forty year old casino after all 
we were told that we could upgrade to a lagoon suite for an additional us 150 per night which 
the place is dated but fine for a good nights sleepasked to stay a second night but as 
the inside of the facility is beautifully painted 
the staff is extremely professional 
we stayed in an executive room free internet 
the resort is only 18 months old and everything is in great shape 
senses breakfast buffet was n't worth the cost unless you plan on eating a large amount of food 
walk across shinagawa station towards the isetan supermarket and will find more small eateries located 
good value 
this is a massive grand resort 
a good value for money hotel for both business and pleasure 
the check-in staff at north hotel was very nice and friendly on our arrival day - she was 
but then just a short walk away is a rgeat pool 
and good wifi 
a great pool serving cocktails at a swim up bar 
the spa ? 
the golf carts around resort worked well but there are a lot of utility carts and if you walk you 
inside and outside shower available 
it 's own aquarium and indoor activity center ( epson aqua ) but the best deal is 
there are also shopping mall 's and plenty of restaurants in easy walking distance 
there are also a fine mix of restaurants to suit every taste and culture 
it is the little anantara touches that make this resort very special 
this is a great base for shopping in oxford street 
would stay here again next time 
my problem was the comfort of the bed and the rooms proximity to the lifts which had very loud audible 
a mordern and quality hotel in a perfect location for london 
ask for a high floor 
best location near to marble arch 
surprisingly the minibar was complimentary 
nice big clean room 
lounge on the first floor offers great beverage choices 
which is a big bonus for us 
i stay in hotels 75-125 nights a year and mainly stay with marriott spg properties 
but to be in london means to be in the city and outside for me 
the bonus is the balcony and the view 
in retrospect whether i should have chosen the city view side of the tower 
free tuk tuk into town but they wont pick up but an easy 10 min walk back 
windy & cold in the evening but on the positive side great temperatures during the days for sightseeing 
you have to walk to the station ( about 5min walk ) and then catch the skytrain to 
kathmandu is right in the city and is well maintained 
with a good spread of local and western options ( including hot and fresh pancakes and waffles ) 
end of silom street near to the river 
food quality was excellent 
you can exercise at their very well equipped gym 
breakfast buffets great every day 
we have been to sevilla early january 2010 for a couple days trip and had a chance 
however easy access to the sky bar made it all the more special 
went to the really old swimming pool and guess how much three singha beers were 
have a drink but skip the expensive dinner 
and having all the extra space was very nice 
with reclining couches and amazing views of bangkok 
if you come by car you may find very difficult to park for free as most streets nearby require ticket 
anyway a well located quality hotel in seville at affordable rates 
including bath and separate shower with double-basin sink 
i ca n't comment on the hotel itself as we did not stay there but the hotel from the 
there 's also a tiny balcony 
the new 'modern wing' is a long way from the rest of the hotel and clearly only 
great staff and friendly service 
the anchor bar in the main building was an excellent place to relax with a drink 
one of the best hotels we have stayed at 
bts and the metro are a long walk away 
cocktails at the villa was great finish to wonderful day 
especially those with families or a group of friends to benefit from the spacious room 
the swimming pool is also good 
the lobby is pretty wide with the concierge on one end while the front desk reception on the 
and did n't have the chance to take advantage of the hotel 's amenities and wetlands location 
full size hair dryer 
there was a hot tub on the balcony ( would n't heat ) and the views were second to 
the bar is nice 
large and marble-walled luxury with rain showers and high-end soaps 
this hotel is lovely 
rooms are nice and of good size 
the lobby was tranquil and peaceful and the rooms were excellently sized and appoiinted with 
bed is comfortable and offers good sleep quality 
only negative point it 's a bit far from everything , so you have to take a taxi or 
the drapes opened and i saw an amazing view of the pool and the mountains 
modern in a busy city 
i stayed at this property last year for 6 days 
there is also an a la carte menu that you can order off of 
enjoy the architectural beautiful building and surroundings 
the smoky glass toilet situation is a bit intimate 
for tourists the hotel is not the most centrally located 
the chef made it a point to prepare non spicy dishes since i am extremely allergic to spicy food 
try to get a high floor and facing the beach if possible 
the way in which he took my details to arrange a taxi for the next morning did not fill me 
fine for airport hotel but mediocre food options 
but then again as an airport hotel 
the bathroom had the biggest and the thickest towels 
solid airport hotel in a good location 
a comfortable hotel conveniently close to the airport 
all of the staffs are super friendly and very helpful 
had to catch an early flight next morning 
the walls are thin 
i really enjoyed the jogging in the morning by the beach side 
had all the basic amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel 
but it is on a lovely setting by the water and beach 
very modern hotel but lacking the basic amenities 
breakfast was good with adequate spread 
strong - actually great shower btw ) trap in the room because you you will find one blue expensive 
the upgraded room are nice and well appointed however there was no signage from the elevator to tell me which 
it is an easy walk from the baggage reclaim 
although it 's a bit further from the main areas that are walkable 
we had requested a high floor and were very lucky with our view right over the ocean 
the lobby and common areas are nice and modern 
also montparnasse has plenty of restaurants to choose from 
this will cost you extra 4 
a simple 15minute walk to the metro and you find yourself in the heart of barcelona in no 
it is truly unbelievable and one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at in my entire life 
the bar at the highest level is pretty nice as well - the steak restaurant is awesome 
since there are better options to be had 
it gives you totally different vibe from what rest of barcelona has to offer ( ramblas 
my room was 1-11-29 the eleventh floor tower one and at the end of the 
breakfast spread is also quite wide 
the bathroom as such is a bit unconventional 
i will not complain about the low light in the room and i will not complain about the soft bed 
self laundry service available 
dividing the bathroom and the room 
the hotel is a short walk to the entrance to tokyo disneyland and the disney 
shuttle bus was easy to find although keep in mind it only leaves every 30 min so depending on 
one is unfortunate enough to have to use an airport hotel 
i have stayed again at this hotel in december and i have to recognize once again the quality of 
the price was n't cheap ( 150 per night ) so i was expecting more than premier inn standard 
there is a half desk behind the bed 
the hotel has excellent free shuttle bus service to and from the pek airport which was very helpful given 
after loosing a connecting flight due to a horrific delay of our flight into beijing 
good restaurants and a nice club lounge that 's opened all day long 
the lobby is nice and spacious unlike some other hotels in similar standards 
after sitting the freezing cold lobby for several hours 
it was a great price for the 1 night but the rooms were quite small but fine for a city 
nicely decorated and renovated 
spacious and clean 
front desk staff efficient and helpful 
the wifi is terribly slowthe gym has the same problem - large 
got a big king size deluxe 
airport bus stop is just 1 min walk and little chinatwon is just around the corner 
kuantan can be a little spread out so staying in a hotel next to a shopping centre 
very comfortable and had a nice shower 
but i ca n't see any property topping the mo 
the drinks were nice 
enjoyed the swimming pool and the gym which were incredibly presented and serviced 
please just come and find out for yourself what a true five star chicago experience really feels like 
4 great restaurants 
the bed was very comfortable and wif-fi was included 
i understand that a new high end mall next to the hotel is currently being built 
great location 
great wifi 
spa facilities wonderful 
we will certainly return on our next visit to shanghai 
and has quick access to anything from a deli to a sit down steakhouse 
the room wasnt brilliant but was nice enough and comfortable 
possibly the one with the most proper dining outlets and facilities there is after closure of impiana ( apart 
but the staff were lovely and the service was equally as good 
the service was good as well as the value 
restaurants and the beach 
wifi is chargeable in room and the speed is sucks 
also a good view over the city and the pennines 
the room was large with a good view of downtown 
building is a 3-star 
to park you need to park on double yellow 's on a busy street outside the hotel 
i do n't think this hotel is particularly good value 
the bed was also very comfortable and allowed for a good rest 
and the hospitality is efficient but not overly friendly 
i do n't know any hotel with 3 stars or more would allow a dead cockroach on the 
with almost everything you need for a good workout and also a pool and sauna 
and an icy-cool refreshing drink with hints of ginger and lemongrass - perfect pick- 
i also asked about the swimming pool opening times 
tub and shower are huge 
nice sauna too 
a well-located and super comfortable apartment for the 5 of us 
beds are comfortable and sleep quality is good 
the gym was well appointed with cross trainers and treadmills but the pool was rather small 
the price for our rooms are very reasonable compared to all other shangri-la we have visited 
it is in an old building in the heart of old montreal 
it is also very convenient for the rest of the city - a short walk to chinatown and maybe 
the bed is too hard 
we chose to stay in a lake facing room with semi-private pool which was wonderfully relaxing 
as it was 32 degrees celcious and we could only look at the beautiful pool but it was not 
it is not elegant nor luxury but we enjoyed the one night stay 
they have a magnificent facility with a great atmosphere and very well trained staff members 
we were upgraded to a room with access to a private pool ( shared by about 8-10 rooms 
the lake view rooms have access to a moat pool which was nice but few have any sun 
the beds are hard and old 
a real palace built in the last 15 years would make any king feel at home 
beds and sheets are of poor quality - my bathroom sink was cracked and the fluorescent lighting made me 
all the amenities that you would expect from fairmont 
the spa pool area is just heaven to relax in and the outside terrace restaurant has superb views night 
the hotel room was clean and spacious 
a simple espresso shoud fit in this price 
the restaurants very first class with food and service of the highest standard 
with views across to the temple of zeus from its top floor dining room 
we had a very busy trip but spent our last afternoon just enjoying the hotel and you should too 
the commode ( the porcelain fixture located in a bathroom ) is at a very low height 
and all the amenities you need 
the hotel at least the part we stayed in was newer 
this hotel has a level of grandeur that is a delight and this will be my choice of hotel 
the steaks in the restaurant were very good 
this time no upgrade for le club accorhotels platinum member that made me realize how tiny their 
hotel room feels old and jaded 
and it was spacious and had a good view of boston skyline 
toilet is fine and a lavatory outside of the toilet is a good idea 
functional rooms with basic amenities 
the hotel was clean and the people at the reception concierge were friendly 
in easy walking distance from both acland and fitzroy streets and facing the bay 
standard furniture and a large flat screen tv with a good selection of western channels 
big and comfortable bed with a very nice bathroom 
nothing was a problem for the very helpful staff here 
a small casino 
free shuttle from harbour 
as part of holiday trip coming by ferry from hong kong and departing next day by train from 
if you are in that area it is a good business class hotel 
however at present it is more advisable to stay in taipa rather than macau where you 
the location of the hotel is only a small distance to popular tourist attraction and accessible via underground train is 
the hotel was booked for us by our travel agent in australia and we took the opportunity to 
if and when we go back to macau we will definitely stay here again 
there are shuttle bus sending us out of hotel ( but i could never figure out where and the timing 
it is a 5 minute walk to the metro station where one can easily get anywhere in the city 
breakfast is pretty good and good coffee as well 
the club lounge is a bit small but serves the purpose for a drink and for breakfast 
i reckon the staff are super friendly and lovely 
i have to say , however , that on our last trip we were really thrilled by the service 
coming here in the off-tourist season netted me a great room rate 
slick service throughout ( bar occasional minor lapses in the club lounge ) cosmopolitan feel 
the room was typical without excessive luxury 
the city is excellent - make sure you visit mercado de san miguel and calle baja 
we only stayed for one night at the intercontinental & enjoyed our stay 
which pasta was delicious and the portion was moderate 
the butler dealt with it impeccably - by checking first the volume by coming into our room - 
all pool areas offer food service and pure indulgence 
nice pools 
the best resort hotel but the rooms is old 
the water floods the floor outside & soaks up the floor mat 
i am a regular visitor for one or two days every three months and the staff are recognize me and 
a huge resort 
the bed was comfortable enough 
so i think its just a matter of time because the bar is really crowded 
each room on my floor was equipped with the exclusive pure air purifier which allows you to have the 
stayed here for 4 nights and had a very comfortable stay 
the staff is very kind with a strong commitment to customer care 
wonderful breakfast made to order 
the size and busyness of the resort can be a bit overwhelming at first 
private romantic dinner set ups 
there is a electronic toilet seat installed - keeps the seat warm 
gym was nice and mens locker room with steam and sauna were great 
e we get to avoid the long queues and get to sit at the elevated bar area ) and the 
the lobby seems to be empty where you will find the reception counters on your right once your enter the 
i liked being able to open the windows 
this is the only hotel in the world where i have had to be asked to leave the elevator lobby 
a nespresso machine and clean exterior windows would have added a star 
we booked a one bedroom and the living dining kitchen room was very spacious with big floor to ceiling windows 
the downside is that it is a good 20-30 minute walk depending on where you need to 
the location is fantastic 
the breakfasts were also good 
impressive spent a few days here for a conference and was very impressed with the overall quality of the 
the quality is excellent 
the lobby had an odd smell 
recent remodeling is world class and the ambiance striking 
tried sea food buffet one night and totally enjoyed it 
the bathroom clean and nice 
all and all a very good hotel experience with very good service and value for money 
the location is good 
we chose to stay here as it is convenient for the metro and airport and we had liked their restaurant 
wifi access was good enough for me to stream foxtel to watch a certain tv 
this is one of sydney 's largest hotels situated on the boarder of the cbd 
and this hotel was reasonably priced and close to ( a ) the singapore office and ( b ) 
almost everywhere is possible to go walking 
there were not enough towels 
there is complimentary wi-fi in the public areas and the rooms 
claudia gouvenia who toke care of me during my stay she is very efficient and 
particularly with street information good beds and sheets for quality sleep good bathroom and amenities hotel is within 20 minutes 
just amazing i was staying at the sofitel liberated end of may and i have to say just 
shopping centres are also close bugis street is good 
nice good size swimming pool to swim in and relax 
and plenty of good restaurants 
there is free wireless in the room and it was very fast 
this particular stay was pretty good 
i stayed on the club floor and the look of that lounge was not good 
food - breakfast buffet is great 
the air-conditioning did struggle to get the room below 71f ( 21c ) but you 
there 's now only a shower 
so it was a long wait for the omelette 
was assigned a room overlooking a very noisy construction site - had to be downgraded to get a qu 
the room was spacious and the bed ok 
but at least have a ( slow ) internet wi-fi free of charge 
close to the metro 
the beds in the rooms were very comfortable and the rooms had all the amenities that you would normally get 
there is neither a fridge nor a mini-bar in the room so if you need to chill something 
even though it was noisy due to the festival in the evening 
only a very short walk to the beach and lovely restaurants 
the lobby areas on the guest room floor were really smart - big leather sofa 's in the lift 
our 2 bedroom unit had the most amazing view of the ocean and was such a spacious and nicely furnished 
good size with a full kitchen so able to self cater if needed 
nice clean sofa coverings 
the elevators are extremely slow 
good deal nearby the airport 
better airport hotels like maydrit nearby 
would definitely look for off property dining options next time 
the lobby lounge has very nice atmosphere 
a point of contention of my first visit 
every staff is trained with great hospitality and professionalism so expect your stay as smooth as its best 
the design of the room and furnishings were very nice 
good bathroom with shower and bath separated and a minibar with all you need 
very good hotel airport from the shuttle to the check , breakfast and check out . 
there is a good bar with panoramic views and the chinese restaurant is worth a try 
there is a separate toilet and bathroom 
the open flow between bathroom and bedroom is a nice touch and the shower 
within walking distance there are choices to food and even got a starbucks nearbythe rooftop bar is awesome 
hotel guests have free access to the bar at top floor ( otherwise they charge 100 rmb per 
but provides all the services and amenities that one expects 
the reception area is always busy and you must patiently wait your turn 
nice clean lobby 
the staff are very helpful and professional and the club lounge is very good offering good breakfasts 
and the 360 degree view from the vue bar on the outdoor deck of the 32nd floor is 
great gym and meeting rooms 
treadmills and free weight you could want 
the food was excellent 
the bed was very comfortable and the shower a good one 
couple of great little restaurants next door and across the road and a number of coffee shops 
the pool and gym facilities are very good however i did note that the floor in the ladies changing rooms 
jacuzzi and sauna are a bonus and the fitness room is well equipped 
the breakfast spread was good and service adequate 
comfortable bed and clean bathroom 
fresh orange juice available 
weight machines and free weights - although an off brand - star tac 
location to the bund is great a short walk will have you walking over the waibaidu bridge 
taxis around the cbd are very cheap and the driving is something else 
rooms itself are appropriated equipped but the furniture are a little beaten up 
it 's free to guests 
the vue bar must have one of the best cityscape views in the world 
n nwe did have trouble with the air conditioning not working that well but the maintenance man changed the 
plus on top of that the toilet was broken and in the end i had to move to another room 
getting a taxi was difficult for me as well- furniture felt dated- staff was quite nonchalant 
thought it was a nice gesture but that meant that i had to forgo my initial request for a 
restaurants and cafes right outside this hotel 
the drive from the airport is long so you need to have enough time when you head back 
we had to line up for about 5 minutes before a table was ready 
walking is arguably the best way to discover the sights and sounds of the area 
the property has massive potential and its location is also ecellent 
the leisure facilties ( swimming pool and fitness centre ) are great 
look this hotel offers good value in a central location but not much more 
the heritage is ideally located a short walk from all the major jumping off points for seeing lisbon 
the wifi was great 
must be one of the best restaurants in santa fe 
breakfast , three days running the waitress got the order wrong . 
the hotel is right across the street from the bus terminal - which is also an entry point to the 
there are much better options out there ( i personally like the michelangelo hotel ) 
some of them enough spacious 
but in terms of hotel security there were guards at the door ensuring guests were welcomed and safe 
on the lower floors i am sure this could be quite intrusive 
the heat ac control in the room was initially difficult to figure out tv reception was poor for english speaking 
good beds with nice bedlinen 
although some subway noise on low floor 
with all the basic amenities 
rooms are clean but small ( expected in europe ) 
19th century opulent ) decor 
pros- amazing location on lake como- feel the wings of history and italian culture 
once we found our way out of the car park and the hotel entrance 
wonderful setting 
conveniently located next to a metro station 
astonishing propriety and exquisite service 
this property is located immediately outside grands boluevards station in the 9th arr 
if you are looking for complete and total relaxation with service as expected by the most discerning traveler 
the westin property next door is nowhere in the league 
and you can dine on the terrace in nice weather with a beautiful view of the lake 
met many of her colleagues during our stay and they were just great 
a lot of nice sandwiches and tarts that complimented the champagne and teas nicely 
lunch and dinner a little too heavy for our tastes but extremely accomplished and good with wine pairings 
the hotel staff are incredible and their attention to detail is amazing 
well lit with french windows opening onto a lovely private patio 
highly recommended hotel 
the staff was pleasant 
service was just fine , as i 've usually found it to be at this chain . 
a basic business hotel that could use a renovation 
they have missed a bit at this hotel all works fine but they have n't got it right - 
room spacious and bathroom modern 
50 meters or less is the main road mannerheimintie 
very comfortable bed and the amenities are first rate 
the buffet breakfast was very good 
with good signal strength 
first visit and i like this place 
easy access to shibuya 
the upside of you are active it is handy to the 3 flights of stairs up and down if the 
the pool area was quite nice and well maintained 
and it aldo has quite a few trees so it is a little secluded from the main 
there 's basement parking for 20 a night but try to park early 
the beds are extremely large and comfortable 
comfortable rooms with nice comfortable beds 
close to the airport 
worth the cost 
front desk 
the hotel is only a five minute drive from lax airport by free shuttle bus but unlike other hotels which 
nice hotel and handy to lax 
pretty quick and absolutley friendly check in in a nice but a little cornered lobby area 
the hotel is situated in a quiet area which i liked but it is only a very short taxi ride 
situated on seminyak beach this hotel has a nice pool and garden 
one can never truly get bored with elephant rides had with excursions to the nearby national parks 
on a beautiful beachthe service is first rate the food of a very high standard and the accommodation is 
which wasnt so bad as we love to see all the hussle and bussle happening 
u get what u expect from a 5 star resort like accor 
there was a lot of scurrying around to find a driver and van and then a lot of 
it did n't seem like we were staying at an aman 
cocktails cool and the restaurant scene fun 
the common areas are stylish as you would expect 
and doors that ope from here as well as the bedroom to the huge outdoor terrace and the 
matched with excellent service and cuisine 
beach and rooms are great 
stayed at the royal beach for 4 nights in a garden room which was very spacious and as we 
upstairs - huge main bedroom with fridge 
food is good and best is the location 
000 for a stack of laundry same day service 
but clean and spacious 
she still retains some of her old charm whilst keeping up with the times 
hotel common areas 
as with all shangri la 's the facilities are amazing 
basic rooms but clean 
the ethnic group performances in the lobby were super fun as was the morning tai chi 
we also tried the room service a couple of times and the service was prompt and the food quality the 
the lobby is huge 
old property 
i stayed at the executive floor and the hostess at the executive desk was outstanding i have never met 
that said - as with so many major hotels in china - the building is fabulous 
if they had an attendant to clean up after these poorly behaved people the facilities were nice 
everything about this hotel just seemed a bit substandard and not good enough for a 4-star 
the lobby is grand with many chandeliers and the rooms and bathrooms are plush and very comfortable 
but for a seasoned traveler quite disappointing in that it does not offer anything but the bare necessities of life 
bar and restaurant options are fine but i would recommend the roof top bar and restaurant at the hilton 
the dining room needs closer attention to staffing and cleanliness and the club lounge has a limited menu 
great bar 
the concierge are excellent and knowledgeable 
the gym was really large and well-equipped 
a nice bar and club lounge etc 
the rooms are large and well maintained 
the facilities are excellent 
beautiful hotel near convention center 
we stayed on the horizon club floor - the lounge was brilliant and the staff extremely attentive 
the wireless internet is free 
the mount st deli opposite is a good coffee spot also 
the hotel is located in a great neighborhood with a variety of excellent restaurants within walking distance such as sc 
the bathroom was really nice 
i booked a club room and the club room facilities were good 
well equipped ) the bed is amazing and my bosphorus view was very good 
great design ! 
an honest 4 property in a good location 
so it was quieter and that suited us perfectly well 
old towels 
washing machine and full size fridge- modern bathroom- great value and beautiful accomodations- breakfast 
but just cross the street and hail one 
however we were very happy with our pool view room in the village ( which had a huge bed 
the very friendly and efficient receptionist did everything she could to correct the situation 
the room service was good 
next good size room 
the bed was comfortable with nice bedding 
the public spaces are light and airy 
big windows 
and the staff were very attentive 
public areas and rooms - all very finely designed 
personal choice of whether you would prefer to be physically closer to reception and the main restaurant as outlying 
the hotel has raised the bar in bangalore and provided visitors an option to experience tasteful luxury at 
the security is very good and the hotel is a wonderful oasis in a busy city 
only issue is that most of the restaurants do n't open until 7 or 7 
there is a hot tub which is right next to the pool which would be great during the short winter 
lobby manager is good and attentive to the needs of all guest 
and several of the restaurants 
there is a big fully equipped gym open 24x7self parking is 21 
a good facility but outrageous parking fees 
with super comfortable bedding 
two excellent restaurants - chinese and north indian - both highly recommended 
18 hole golf course right on site 
nice fitness and swimming pool and the roof top bar was a great place to end a busy day 
the room is really spacious 
two big pools 
the two persons who made everything look so good was chef dinesh 
very comfortable 2 room pool villas and the resort serves excellent varieties of foods 
the golden buddhist temple at kushalnagar is definitely worth a visit 
i would definitely stay at this hotel again 
the bed was very nice to sleep in and the bathroom featured the regulation rain forest shower ( although the 
they also have a nice bar downstairs -- great for a night cap 
nice general use areas 
much ado about nothing kinky , kitschz , quaint , modern , quirky , different , beautiful 
modern and especially convenient for airport 
breakfast was not very good compared to other german hotels 
thin linen and other than the beds one forlorn plastic chair 
two aged ( flat ) pillows 
a cool mix of contemporary chic with the building historic past 
as the whole area is not very pedestrian friendly and there were no signs for the hotels 
budget is an over statement . 
a nice spa area 
higher floors give you a better view of the singapore skyline 
we chose to eat in the fine dining railway carriage as it was our anniversary - what a great exper 
as it was very near the shops and the the metro ( mrt ) 
or cost conscious 
restaurants and high end shopping just steps away from the hotel 
the location is excellent 
but they could lessen the pressure on space by opening the lounge for longer 
restaurants and the subway 
again it 's not a very big bathroom but quite good specially if you 're just alone 
buffet breakfast was generally good but seating seemed to be a bit cramped 
the public areas like the lobby are well taken care of 
steps from all the shopping you could possibly handle 
stayed at this great hotel for 3 nights and absolutely loved it 
our room ( a loft ) on the 22nd floor was large 
the sri lankan dishes curries were really good but the other ( western ) dishes bland 
the pool itself is huge and there are little cabana 's located on the far side 
ask for a higher floor facing orchard road for night viewmake sure you enjoy their breakfast buffet - 
wawa demonstrated their good customer service 
you either order drinks or bottled water 
the pool area is well maintained and free wifi works well in the ground floor common areas but elsewhere is 
i would bitterly disappointed with the standard of this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone 
so you have to join each queue for tickets to the area surrounding each main pyramid at 60le each 
they are not lit up at night so it is only a day time view- but opening the curtains 
the pool area was lovely as was the spa and gymnsaium 
bathrooms are very good with toiletries and and a dressing table stool area for the ladies 
a dry sauna 
my favourite place to spend time is at the ground floor based bar and restaurant along the busy street 
i had asked for high floor and extra feather pillows 
best to be on the 16th floor or higher 
but we were told other lodges located further in the jungle are able to offer more 
there were two double beds and there were very comfortable 
stop for all tourist buses and straight shared drop off available right under the hotel 
the ones further away from the elevator can be a long walk 
no ventilation and very low water pressure . 
it also means you will have no problem finding your way back to the hotel as it is visible for 
we loved everything about the nice pool terrace and its newly refurbished too 
even if there were plenty of tables available but nobody to welcome and escort us 
very nice executive lounge for platinum gold members 
furnishings were modern and the location in the middle of the city is convenient for any traveller 
the happy hour food & bev in the lounge is fantastic with the exhibition cooking 
pastries ) and the selection was the same each day ( e 
the parking was very expensive 
the rooms are nice and clean 
the hotel itself was clean 
the price seemed high but likely typical for downtown la 
while the property is new 
club on top floor have great view 
the hotel is stunning after the renovations 
there are two main restaurants both of which provide an excellent variety of food 
there is a small shopping mall about 1 minute walk away with a supermarket 
the desk is a card table 
takes your breath away while we did n't stay the night at rambagh , we were 
will definitely come back . 
the red tiled ground floor hall and restaurant bar was exotic and the offer of a 1 breakfast was 
we were told that a full renovation is planned for 2011 
good hotel , great service cute boutique hotel with large , comfortable rooms . 
at 5pm every day complimentary refreshments were provided in the lobby 
this is yet another wonderful private palace turned into a hotel 
the rambagh palace is probably one of the best hotel in india 
we called the front desk a number of times and they finally sent someone up 
the large bathroom was very plush and the shower was hot and powerful 
gorgeous hotel but expensive 
breakfast service is good and the gym had all the basic equipment 
le meridien is in a perfect location 
staff very friendly and reception always available 
the indoor pool is a great facility 
right in the centre of town and lose to all attractions and the train station airport so ideal 
it had all the comfortable amenities that you would expect 
only for the dinner located on the former palace dinning roomkishan and havish are the 
everything is in easy walking distance 
enjoy great restaurants and you can meet ( as we did ) some holywood celebrities 
the hotel has no free internet 
as the kings shops nearby offer several solid alternatives 
the front desk staff and the lovely welcoming ladies were exceptional 
it 's about a 3 minutes walk to the boqueria and there are a lot of nice 
wonderful pool 
and 8 for one piece of french toast is just ridiculous at best 
from nice shopping mall to restaurants 
so i 'd check if noise bothers you 
the 30 resort fee is a joke 
rooms are spacious and clean 
i had 2 massages and they were nicer than the hilton 
you will expect a very nice and luxury setup for the room but it is not up to standard 
the bar staff and restaurant staff were equally helpful and cheerful 
you wo n't be doing any of this in privacy ( unless you are staying alone ) because if 
location - perfectly located on hollywood blvd with the walk of fame right outside ( hi jenn 
nice bar and good ambiance for the evening 
being used to getting hit with exorbitant bills at bars and restaurants at most hotel chains like sher 
poor room pool room viewsif you 've not been to la before - this in my fourth time 
i understand the risks associated with valeting a car however when you go to a 5 star hotel you 
i was on the upper floors and could hear the disco at night 
valet parking attendants very responsive - i liked that one could text to have the car brought up 
however our room was really quiet 
there are 2 swimming pool areas and the villas are divided by areas or villages 
they ca n't do enough for the guests 
it was a lovely stay and we will be back soon 
except for bright lights at the bar that shine right into your eyes if you sit at a bar stool 
very efficient shuttle service 
the bed was very comfortable and i always take note of airport hotels in the u 
front desk staff was nice 
the restaurants were very good with attentive staff and excellent food 
fluffy dirty carpets 
a well equipped gym and good swimming pool along with a fine jacuzzi 
we were given vouchers for the continental buffet 
the room is very specious and the chinese restaurant provides quality chinese food in a modern and 
next to ferry terminal 
but it lacks the private access to the bospheros 
this hotel was extremely busy both by a departing conference and the check in of hundreds of cruise returnees 
on the 12th floor with a balcony and gorgeous views over port everglades 
with just enough room for toiletries near the basin 
the staff at reception were helpful and friendly 
and perhaps the best city suite we 've ever had 
extremely friendly and accomodating to both our early arrival and unusual request to store a birthday cake 
newly refurbished basic hotel 
handu for short stays in the city . 
the bed and bedding very comfortable 
good conference rooms and all at a comptetive price point 
staff as always were great - front desk 
the public spaces and the guest rooms are all top notch and pay homage to the location with an art 
i am always made extremely welcome and staff remember my name even though i only visit on an annual visit 
comparing with westin which i normally stay 
extensive public areas and a bit of warmth in the guest rooms 
( ohhhhhh and do n't miss the view of shanghai at night from the open 
they do n't have a great bar 
) the gym and pool are are excellent 
the lobby is small and the front desk was too close to the elevator lobby 
the room is stunning 
it is a good location close to attractions and good restaurants 
the breakfast spread was good 
unfortunately pillows too soft 
it 's good value 
our morning walks down the road allowed us to interact with many locals who were all friendly 
and the music was loud enough to keep us and the little one awake ( on the top floor ) 
especially front desk 
a competent good hotel 
and found it very good value for money 
pool - the infinity pool was quite nice 
views are great at the higher floors 
spread was good and value was decent 
room has everything you can find from a normal hotel and clean 
thumbs up . 
instead went for a short walk to the city centre where there are many different options 
the front desk staff was very helpful and they have a good variety of brochures for exploring the city 
the walls were dirty and the door needed cleaning 
the restaurants were excellent and after the first day most the staff knew us by name 
it is a brand new and very shiny airport with no queues 
mini bar 
toilets shower was excellent and the heated floor in the toilet and shower areas were a nice touch 
always eager to help and full of excellent recommendations whether it be private guided tours ( gerhard 
nice large bed which was comfortable 
the location is very good - walking distance from alexanderplatz and close to the u b 
the front desk staff was very helpful and provided me with public transit info and instruction 
upsides of this hotel - great location for both the boardwalk ( early morning run ) and l 
the options were pretty limited and it took 15min to get a class of wine and beer both nights 
moderate sized indoor swimming pool 
totally not worth the price 
however on the beach you have to pay for a chair and umbrella 
good sized rooms and great service there was also adequate speed free wifi 
if you eat in the adjacent bar 
the hotel was great but we did n't get the oceanview room as promised by the staff 
and great sights to see 
not all hotels let you book it so this was a nice change 
dark and gloomy hotel- very friendly staff 
made it to the hotel in less than 1 hour passing immigration and customs but it took almost longer time 
a quirky bar and the city on your doorstep 
really worth it if you 're looking for something a bit above usual price range and better than normal 
bathroom has a deep soaking bathtub with tv 
the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms had a good layout 
the hotel rooms clean and well appointed 
we took a two bedroom unit and the kitchen was very well appointed indeed 
prefer higher floor to gettwin tower view 
the bathroom was fairly small but clean with good water pressure and the hot water was very ( very ) 
floors dirty ( mildew ) 
with a proper renovation this could become a real gem mixing old hotelier traditions with a spark of modern 
showing me the different amenities in the room 
the location is good being only two mins walk from the main beach and of course all the shops are 
room is spacious and clean 
the hostess look frustrated and again unwelcoming and i also felt that all the employees have a 
most people at the front desk can speak english and are willing to help in any possible way 
good executive lounge with a good variety of foods 
but it 's annoying to walk outside 
clean and spacious 
i preferred the quiet of the lounge 
i thought the lounge was excellent 
the confuguration is that there is a large inner courtyard 
lovely and friendly staff 
centrally located and perfect for a short stay to see the terracotta warriors 
room can get stuffy 
travel on the subway is quite easy 
its a place to sleep but lacks the whole 'tassie experience' . 
it was a very good value compared to other hotels 
good price but rooms were looking very tired for a mecure 
some very good restaurants within the hotel 
definitely want to sit outside by the pool to enjoy a better view 
walks or the jeep safari 
very large resort 
superior sea view make the difference as located on the higher floors 
and it will definitely be worth your while going there as the rate for this 6 star hotel is just 
the pool is large 
i would highly recommend this lovely accommodation 
everything was just spotless and the treat and service you receive is just outstanding from the minute you put 
it 's very easy - given the magnificent property- to create a hotel atmosphere that 's a 
the country club is where the two storey gym is that offers weights on one floor & cardio such 
would recommend a llocal boat for a trip round the water village and up river to see the prob 
i had heard a lot about the property and therefore expectations were high 
i stayed there one night as i had to take shinkansen next day 
returning back to this hotel next week and looking forward to the stay again 
upon checking it they welcome you with musicians in indian outfit playing typical local music 
there are few other restaurants also on second & third floors 
this was our second visit to this property and the first since taj took it under their wing 
our arrival at the main entrance was greeted by the sound of a fanfare of horns and drums and 
this is a convenient hotel with friendly 
many are older staff members and their experience shows 
bathroom was clean and amenities were good 
the bed was as hard as hell until i finally complained and then steps were taken to make it a 
it was great to drop into the city bar for a refreshing drink after a day wandering through the narrow 
the top floor is a lovely bar with view over leeds but be warned that on weekends it turns 
nespresso machine and has only a small window 
even if all 3 were on i would still expect long waits 
there are amenities like robes and turn-down service 
roof top bar and pool area was very nice 
breakfast was fine with a good setting overlooking the canal 
the room size was good but always need to remember to put the key card in the slot to activate 
and has a nice reception area with friendly staff 
this is why i will rate hotel highly - most hotels in the 100 price range a good these days 
fitness centre a touch small and the only 2 running machines were full when i first tried - go 
breakfast was nice 
we were lucky enough to win a one night stay in a city suite at this hotel and were generously 
i also love the fact that there is free internet in every room 
the lobby area is impressive and well designed with crystals 
quiet and spacious 
breakfast was decent and of good quality 
hotel location is good and rooms are basic 
very nice hotel with good links to the centre 
we had a wonderful and relaxing stay 
room and sleep quality good 
i liked that the hotel had a central tipping pool which meant we never felt pressured to constantly add a 
lower that and let us enjoy the beach and natural sounds 
a luxurious hotel located in cdb area 
only complaint i would say was they told us breakfast would be ready at 6am 
very good experience and great value 
a better inside soundproofing would be good cause there was the prime minister of a middle east country 
good service 
gem of a place in a concrete and glass jungle 
i have a good room view over looking chao phraya river and the bed is pretty comfortable 
lovely hotel - great suite 
they are well deserved with its fabulous software ( every morning and evening reserve the table with special flowers arrangement 
and is not worth the cost 
and 10 minutes walk from plaza catalunya and les rambles-rooms are not luxurious 
the everything that makes it so exciting to go back to the hotel after a day out 
the decor incredible and a sense of calm surrounds you 
n nthe breakfast staff was very friendly 
and i had the utmost difficulty finding accommodation that is fairly priced that is close to downtown 
bathrooms supplied with very good extras ( shampoos 
mandarin oriental is one of the best hotels in the world 
the pool is great and our spa treatment excellent 
service and menu around pool were good 
this motel is located in oakhurst which is about 8 miles from bass lake and about 1 
if all you need for a night is a clean bed then the hotel will be fine but i wont 
then the butler knocked and introduced himself and brought us a welcome drink 
service are the best in bangkok 
and to be greeted as a old friend to the hotel is lovely 
all restaurants offer excellent fare - china house has the best peking duck in town 
nice pool 
the floor butlers are amazing in their attention to detail and memory 
breakfast on terrace is excellent as well 
the mae ping river is also lined with many interesting restaurants and bars and could make a nice walk 
very quiet and relaxing and you can slip away in here and find a cozy spot to read 
the service got slow in the restaurant 
and great breakfast on the wharf 
we also enjoyed the buffet breakfast which was good if not excellent 
good restaurants and river view 
neat food places nearby if you 're feeling adventurous 
rooms are huge which is another plus for me and i would certainly stay here again on my next trip 
large pool and pleasant relaxing area but needs more shading 
this was an easy tuk-tuk ride from the main old city 
it is a short ride to the night market in a tuk tuk and there are great restaurants 
tea and coffee are available 
always adressing us by name he consistently went out of his way to ensure all the little touches were 
they have a free shuttle at some hours to go to the bazar market and tuk tuk 
prosgreat locationrestaurant food quality goodairport transfers goodconsexecutive rooms and 
prage is a great city and we also went to dresden 
i just wanted to highlight that the tripadvisor reviews are glowing and the hotel is rated as a 
other amenities included welcome champagne and chocolates 
with cold towels and water 
the hotel is located to some nice close local restaurants 
the bed and the sleep quality has been very good 
the large hotels systematically arranged around wide streets just remind me too much of other planned resorts like bint 
gorgeous property on huge 5 acres of land 
asian cuisine 
a must for those looking for a little luxury 
the pool area was nice 
not every stay has been perfect however and when mentioned to mgmt 
large comfy bed 
service at the hotel was wonderful from the front desk staff to the pool staff to the gym and spa 
the hotel is not at the beach but they have a free transportation to their own beach with a small 
my only complaint is the temperature of the pool water which was really really cold and unpleasant because of that 
good size 
the pool area is relatively nice as well 
this resort was nice 
we had a very spacious suite - around 1450 sq feet with 2 full bathrooms 
bottom line -- stay here if you are attending a conference at the convention center -- a nice walk ( 
which otherwise was very adequate in size and nicely decorated 
good poolside drinks and food 
this is a true 5 star resort with exceptionally friendly 
we checked in the jimbaran room it was a good size room with two one king size 
although some local friends found the prices a tad high 
efficient helpful staff 
to the luxe como shambala toiletries and the scrumptious elegant food at 
large rooms 
views are of the busy streets of the modern gangnam district 
while the rooms and the outside of the hotel might need an update all their staff provided one of the 
with great touches in the rooms like a comfy reclining chair 
love the big windows and they are clean 
the floor-to-ceiling windows and modern minimalist design of the rooms are beautiful 
i did n't feel connected or related to the hotel 
i spent 3 hours having a massage and a facial and definitely felt and 
i told a staff member just in passing that it surprised me they had free flow coconut juice during breakfast 
although their wine list is n't great by the glass and relatively expensive for what you get 
the pool area is very nice 
perfect stay 
we also enjoyed the spa and the good-sized swimming pool 
the hotel reminded me alot of the hyatt in kyoto which is one of my favourite hotels 
the spacious bathroom with the oversized tub is my favourite spot to unwind after a long day at work 
fair enough everything was of very high quality ( excellent power shower 
the staff is very good and helpful though 
our master plan was to spend our first few nights at westin chosun which was just a 
my room on the 9th floor was full of car sounds all night long 
the bed was very hard - the mattress was super firm - there was very little give 
ca n't say enough about this one . 
so lots of restaurants near by 
after a long flight 
the buffet breakdfast was excellent 
access by car is a bit tricky and parking is not free though 
most of the time the pool is a pleasant outside area with glass walls which catch the warmth and protect 
nice bar at the timber house which is in the basement 
rooms are a good size but i did struggle with the lighting and the tv froze often and could n 
check in was good and manager very chatty 
it has recently been refurbished , at least the rooms have been upgraded . 
food was excellent . 
delicious and diverse buffet breakfast with a lot of choice in cheese hams popular in germany 
good hotel in great location 
and big buffet breakfast 
rooms offer good value 
we were in room 311 in the garden wing 3rd floors have balconys and better views 
we stayed in a 1 bed room which was very spacious and had all the modern amenities 
vienna is a great city at this time of year 
the air con was a little on the poor side but you can open the windows 
i was moved up to a higher floor after the first night 
neat and clean room and positive desire to give good service 
front desk staff were very helpful 
low building quality this intercontinental hotel suffers from low building quality , many parts of the hotel was broken 
the bathroom has a huge double spa bath 
the room was your average sheraton room 
the suite is nice though 
could use a little updating but really good quality nonetheless 
having stayed at the westin previously this is definitely not at the same level the rooms are dark service 
in addition the structure is modern and located in the good area 
and good value for money- room 
the hotel is located just above ti yu xi lu station which makes it very easy to 
the breakfast at the executive lounge is awesome 
although the swimming pool looked nice 
there are also other restaurants nearby so you are not confined to the hotel for meals 
the bar had a great view and band 
only stayed one night during a brief leisure trip but everything was just right - from spacious self catering room 
good restaurants around as well 
it is also very close to the guangzhou east railway station where you can get the high speed 
great service and good size oasis pool 
the pool is nice and relaxing and the workers around the pool are very friendly 
saigon saigon bar a little overrated but the hotel itself is very good 
there are also many restaurants ( including a lovely indian restaurant ) in the same building which makes it 
rooftop bar is a plus 
but certainly not worth the price 
we walked next door to the sheraton and they fixed the same tour for us for 90 
swimming pool it lap pool and is open until 10pm at night 
you 're close to all of the major attractions 
comfy beds and pillows and spotlessly clean 
) the rooms are of a nice size and have nice bathroom and nice products in the bath room cant 
breakfast was varied and plentifull and the staff could not have been more helpfull 
i know you can ask for extra pillows etc 
both are fine hotels however where 's as the hyatt may have a slight advantage in terms of 
we also walked down to the ben thanh market - it 's undercover and is a good place 
the bed was very plush and comfortable which was very much appreciated after the hard beds i had experienced during 
great historic hotel with horrible service 
the club lounge was excellent with a fantastic breakfast and evening canap s 
the professional staff 
the views are amazing & the decor is sumptuous 
it was too cold to use the pool but the pool area was lovely 
the gym was new and so all of the machinery worked and had television entertainment on command 
very nice lobby though missing out on larger sitting area 
with any older hotel 
but the food was delicious 
this 500-acre property is a do-it-yourself type of resort 
the toiletries are lovely 
we had a team dinner at the main restaurant -- the service was excellent and the food was great 
a bit better signage & pathway lighting would be welcomed as i preferred to walk from room to main building 
i am a very unhappy customer 
it was nice and spacious 
small frig and the generous closet space 
i travel quite a bit and most hotels no longer even charge 
the hotel bar is nice too 
nice and clean hotel 
scullers jazz club was located in the hotel and is a great place to hear live jazz at 
had a good stay 
the hotel is quite nice and clean and in a very good location 
the dining room is attractive at breakfast time 
location is good ( close to the harvard campus ) 
very nice facility 
free drinks 
the bathroom was clean 
we were given a free upgrade to a room with a patio 
there 's a small round table with a single chair 
our rooms in the main building were completely fine and had plenty of space 
amazing stay ! 
our room faced the beautiful garden terrace 
the rooms and nice and offer the luxury you expect from a jw marriott branded hotel 
i would definitely stay here again for two reasons - the location and the staff 
wi-fi ( no extra charge ) was fine 
the price was also reasonable for la 
very good la value for a super duper hip spot 
dark curtains 
two self-guided treks are available from the lodge- one to the sun gate at the top 
lunch and tea included with one night 's price 
me and my business colleague had two separate beds - comfortable with many pillows 
the italian restaurant next to the pool 
the exec lounge is passable but feels like an '80s airport waiting area 
upgrades even for platinum members seems to hard to come by due to the high occupancy rates here 
you are asked to leave the luggage at the entrance and make your way to the check in desk a 
check in was quick and easy and the lobby was quiet and nicely decorated 
bed and pillows comfortable 
we has a 3 day city break in kl and the double tree simply could not have been better 
only difference is on higher floor and better view 
the taps were difficult to adjust ( always hot ) and we were scalded many times 
it is incredibly noisy and congested at the lobby which is almost built like an open air area 
the view from the executive lounge is amazing 
so either he is wrong or the hilton web site is wrongeither way i cancelled the 
and the service in the executive lounge was fantastic 
we chose the hotel because of the location which is great for both shopping and theatres 
the bar is sort of cramped and they just seem to miss on a lot of areas 
fantastic hotel and great lounge 
fair enough that i checked in close to midnight 
very good room and good breakfast included in the typically high priced london 5 star break 
the leisure traveller would also find the location near the petronas towers and adjacent to a large shopping 
not a bad place to stay if the price is right 
altogether the hotel is really at good ratio price - what you get 
one point of principle for me was the inflated cost of getting a taxi to the airport from outside the 
breakfast was equally uninspiring and my honest opinion is the lounge access is pointless and there are 
i asked the taxi desk for directions to the station on the first morning and the woman told me my 
located in the city center 
only stayed one night with a group on business 
the nice hotel was closed at the time we came by 
our room ( 816 ) was on the ground floor of a 2-story building and had a 
they did have a pretty good salad bar 
bring food and drinks with you 
and reasonable prices 
the rate at this property is very reasonable and being a hilton diamond member it seemed like a good 
the shop is well equipped and supplies everything you could need at a reasonable price 
i would recommend this hotel to tourists as well as those on business 
there are several restaurants on the property 
a shop and a large swimming pool 
the hotel it self was always spotless and my room extremely clean 
the service was generally excellent 
you just do n't feel like walking around 
the only gripes were the confusing walk from the ampang park lrt station to the hotel - 
rooms have been updated since last visit 2 years ago 
are undoubtedly some of the best hospitality professionals you would ever meet in this country 
would have been livable for national park accommodation but the price is daylight robbery 
the bathroom was nice and clean 
l'hermitage is very well located for visiting the old town and within easy walking distance of 
all the facilities were available with the exception of the very poor brand of instance coffee 
huge bathroom and very comfortable beds ( the pillows are extraordinary 
food was a little disappointing in room service but probably on par with other 5 star hotels 
if you can afford the extra cost treat yourself to a loft 
loved this old building transformed into a cool hotel 
there are some local and international restaurants in the neighbourhood 
excellent renovation 
restaurant are great and maybe some of the best restaurants in perth like nobu 
serving one of the best steaks in town 
housekeeping is bare minimum 
breakfast is additionally provided for residents in the second floor residents' lounge 
the furniture and the furnishings were all awesome and the place had a great washing machine that we took 
not being australians we had n't realised that melbourne cup was celebrated right across austral 
i went home to perth for a long weekend & wanted to show the best of what perth 
this is a nice hotel with big and clean room and comfy bed 
there is an undercover walkway to the twin towers 
we were just too tired to explore the city any further 
with a nice bathroom 
shopping and the cbd 
the grand hotel union executive has an awesome location 
both hotels are good 
excellent property with a nice 
but due to our early departure 
beautiful pool 
equally spacious bathroom w separate tub and shower 
and the food is fantastic 
everything is grand here starting with an imposing lobby to the beautiful foyer 
the beach was also full of tiny jellyfish and you could not enjoy a dip without getting bitten all 
the breakfast buffet is again just about average 
plenty of comfortable lounge chairs 
the marriott building itself will pleasantly surprise you with it 's 13 restaurants they are very stylish and 
i think a spacious business center is a basic for any of 5 star chain 
got a free upgrade to a junior suite 
stayed here four nights due company conference 
the bathroom had a lovely bowl sink 
as there are better facilities for families at the beach villas and jw marriott down the road 
there are several restaurants on the lower ground floor all of which are excellent 
the concierge was very helpful 
location seems far from patong , kata , karon but close to airport . 
life can be crazy and busy - a peaceful retreat provides more value than a noisy nightlife 
but at this price you will get more than you have paid for 
( 1 ) the taxi-fee to go from the airport to the hotel is 500 baht 
very close to the beach 
it was nice for them to offer complimentary breakfast free wifi upgrade for my 3 night stay 
slightly soiled upholstery is a feature throughout the hotel 
overall i would not stay at this hotel unless you are in kl to shop but there are 
had a late arrival for a business trip and the check-in was so fast and efficient 
from the moment one arrives and each time one passes through the front door and lobby there is a warm 
the glass top of the coffee table kept sliding off which was a danger of breakage 
had 2 meals in the shanghainese restaurant which is good and service very attentive making me 
i stayed in marriott for 5 nights and had a pleasant experience 
the executive lounge has also implemented some changes and the young staff are learning quickly 
once we parked the car ( which might be tricky if there are no spots left ) we left it 
i also thought that house keeping could have done a better job of cleaning thr rooms daily 
there was also a sauna and jacuzzi and a nice sized gym 
) - view from the room- room service is great 
also the bathroom is located on the ground floor so if you are prone to go to the bathroom during 
you ca n't go wrong staying here if you 're heading to vegas 
i was glad i did as the room was nicely decorated clean and comfortable and the upgrades were 2 or 
enjoyed our stay but expected better 
exquisite hotel ! 
you have access to several treks from just outside your lodge 
the downstairs cafe here where you can sit outside and enjoy a meal 
and they have some amazing restaurants and bars 
parking is free 
internet access for your laptop is 13 
we could not believe it when our friends booked us a room for 47 a night at this superb hotel 
the room might be a little outdated but still very nice and for the price awesome value 
rooms are big but not something special personnel at front desk and manager on duty totally unfrienfly 
self park is a hike to check in 
with a huge open fire place and lovely stone surrounds 
comfortable accommodation in a beautiful setting ! 
40 per night ) includes internet access for only one device 
one can spend a few hours roaming around the hotel lobby 
we stayed in a pencil pine cabin at the rear of the property which had a gas fire 
the beds and pillows were very comfortable and appreciated the refrigerator that was actually cold 
better hotels would upgrade you free of charge due to this problem -- not paris 
check in was quick and efficient and self parking was straightforward and included free 
the hotel and casino are in a great location and the rooms while not the cleanest and most updated 
the main lodge is nice with a great lounge with open fire 
things did improve gentleman at reception extended our check out time and he was great 
we would have tried to dine here instead if we knew the fine dining food quality was average 
the distances to the front desk 
the beds are way too soft and the sheets do not cover all of the bed so this is not 
the lodge is situated close to the entrance to the national park and equally close to the visitors' centre 
dinner is average and expensive with set prices for each meal so you can pay the same 42 for 
do n't arrive too late especially not late with luggage since the security guy in the lobby will very 
fantastic hotel from the outside 
which was good value 
the rooms are nice and clean 
it 's a good business hotel 
the bathroom was first class with a soaking tub and separate shower 
with free wifi 
pros- room 1610 was tastefully decorated and has a decent size bathroom would good water pressure 
not a lot of shower space by the sink for toiletries but enough drawers to compensate 
the bed is good 
not a fan of a big window in the bathroom facing the room 
there 's a very nice pool area on the roof 
only problem was a strong mouldy smell in our room at the 3rd floor 
our holidays will end up costing more and it is hard enough now to try and have a holiday without 
the bed was extremely comfortable ensuring a good nights sleep 
location is really really good as this hotel is just a short walk to the myeongdong 
with a large spacious lobby 
and it has a lovely little pool 
the hotel had an outdoor pool but the pool area was quite small 
located one block from orchard road and next to some great bars and restaurants 
we stayed here for 6 nights and the standard is very good 
i have only ever stayed here on points as it is a good value redemption if you have priority club 
the bathroom is very nice--good sized with a nice shower and a claw foot tub 
the restaurants were good relatively speaking 
moorea is a very beautiful island and definitely worthy of a luxurious hotel 
you got the pool all for yourself 
convenient location on the more affordable end of orchard road shopping street 
as a regular traveller to singapore this time i got good deal of this hotel 
somerset mtr station is a five minute walk away so the hotel is easy to reach from 
sales promotion 3 services this is the second time i have been in le meridien jedd 
very helpful staff and very friendly 
from the moment we arrived the welcome from ivy on reception was warm and friendly 
an overall external cleaning to the windows will be appreciated 
the bathroom was not large 
it is an older building but still very well kept and there is always a live group in the bar 
service at the front desk was excellent 
it 's reasonably priced and overall a very good stay 
walking distance to many good restaurants 
yet it was still tricky to find parking near your villa 
but a shuttle can drop you off at the very nice beach located at starwood 's other resort 
a sofa and small kitchenette and great view of the water 
the buffet breakfast was varied and very good quality 
jaccuzi tub nice and showers comfortable 
that every time i asked for something like extra towels from housekeeping 
small spa bath opening to the bedroom area 
you have to take a shuttle to the st regis and go thru their massive complex to get to 
they are fully committed to serving their time share owners and hotel guests are second priority at least it felt 
many pools and several have grills where you can cook your own concoction and eat outside 
at the price it is not good value due to these factors 
room comfy and the public areas were nice 
the staff are unremarkable and their attitude made our entire trip much less romantic and special by making it 
valet parking is available 
i have stayed a number of times in this property over the last one and a half years 
the staff was really exceptional 
it was a nice bright area 
the rooms while small are very clean 
we enjoyed free parking 
very central and a beautiful building 
if this hotel is in your budget 
but i can see why people on the lower floors are upset with their room conditions 
the checkin at reception was friendly and quick 
travel time to the convention center station is less than 5 mins then there is a 5 minute walk under 
the rooms are spacious with great amenities 
but if you prefer something a little more modern no doubt you can find plenty of other options for the 
browse for a quick trip if you are in the area 
nice bed and quite halls but you can hear the airplanes although we were to bed late and up 
nice hotel good price 
the duty manager firstly denied there had been a problem the previous night 
an older building 
my bed was soft and i ended up with back ache 
great location for walking downtown to the stores , restaurants , and attractions . 
in my opinion the hilton and reef casino are together as the best hotels in cairns city 
get a suite on the highest floor and away from the main road elevators if you really want a 
with access from stairs at one end of reception 
we aim for hotels that are located in cities but yet offer a good quiet nights rest in a clean 
the rooms are slightly dated but the amazing views and excellent service ( especially the team staffing the concier 
valet parking very efficient 
next to a tram station at the quest and within reach to a few top notched restaurants listed on 
for those of you who read my reviews you would know i 'm a business traveler mostly 
comfortable and had a large bathroom 
i wanted to book a space in the outdoor bar bistro for 150 to watch a rugby 
staff were friendly and the executive lounge offered a reasonable selection of canapes and hot food 
the hotel 's location is superb as it is right on the water but in a quieter part of 
try to get a higher floor with an east facing room 
a good desk 
there is a superb indian restauaant opposite the man entrance to the hotel called little ind 
bellagio shopping was great 
the public areas inside and outside 
the other meals were good rather than amazing but the floating pool 
the style of the furnishings is old and elegant and fits the style of a grand old villa 
not hilton standard wifi 
organized property that you would expect from a hotel of this caliber 
this hotel is poorly managed and needs new management 
lead to a large room with separate lounge which was good on space but the fit out was well past 
banff itself is an easy walk away and worth a look but i like to enjoy the hotel 
nice choice for banff stay no matter short or long stay 
very good second staycation 
swimming pool is a bit of a let down 
there is an innate desire to go back and stay for a week , such is the effect of 
great food 
had a big room ( 387 ) in the main building with view of mountains and bow valley river 
the pool area is amazing with great views of jakarta 
located next to shopping centre where you can get food easily 
the spa is simply amazing 
the views of the bow river valley are definitely worth the extra cost 
centrally located and attached to a shopping mall and a business tower 
the food were nice and the facilities were superb 
there is an italian restaurant with some 57 seats terrible the pasta was served almost raw and had 
great location 
swimming pool was too small for a 5-star hotel like kempinski 
friendly and helpful staff 
christmas dinner was disappointing as they failed to create any christmas atmosphere 
food stations is a bun fight to get anything 
great breakfast spread 
and 5mins to the bus stop that goes to dianchi lakeservice - is quite friendly 
an historic castle venue with hundreds of rooms 
there is a lot of cheaper accommodation available in banff 
classic hotel in wonderful setting 
top notch from a property like this 
and smell fresh 
ok so the area is n't the best - though for me and my friends we had a great 
there is an atm just outside on the patio 
no fresh fruit juice is just a shame for hotel which claims being one of best business hotels and given 
we had room service 2 nights and the server set our table up and delivered our dish as if it 
the shower was large and the pressure forceful 
all staffs are very helpful and very friendly while we stayed there 
we were happy with the private corner we were located villa 17 
great place everything was top notch 
the spa is world-class and the locker room is over the top 
right there that does fantastic thai massage which is a must after you have eaten so much food 
the staff was exceptional in asking us if we needed anything 
breakfast in the morning was a good spread with lots of choices 
the outdoor bathroom was great 
the beach pool scene is fantastic with plenty of deck chairs and ample shade umbrellas 
the little pool was essential 
outstanding customer service 
tables are located at the beach as well 
a two hour free wifi only 
email replies & bath towels are extra ! 
but a good hotel 
budget friendly hotel choice very near the train station 
but not for breakfast ) and some nice restaurants ( especially liked daiba ) 
fantastic friendly and helpful staff 
the staff were outstanding 
they could make this an incredible place but it would take a long renovation which seems unlikely as it is 
its no doubt value for money hotel . 
the price was great as well and you can walk to almost anything if you felt up for it 
with rooms that someone thought about before constructing ( down to detail like a blue night light in the toilet 
my review is based on what i expect of a good airport hotel 
extremely friendly people at the front desk - elaine and isa - did a fabulous job making sure 
an empty fridge for own stuff you want to keep cold 
city view high floor 
the palm property is a level or two above 
we arranged several tours 
best breakfast and perfect service all around 
clean with all the aminities available 
the floors are dark wood and there is a lot of glass 
the egg station is particularly good 
there is also a large mall with many places to eat within walking distance called plenilunio 
stayed overnight before a flight 
bathroom very spacious 
i 'd come back . 
being close to the airport would be the only reason to use this hotel as it is too far from 
while the public areas of the hotel are quite lovely the hallways in the room areas are worn and 
i had stayed once before right after the hotel was renovated and the service had been terrible 
overall good business hotel and efficient enough for the 1-2 day trip where you are in and 
another great stay 
i had a giant suite in the old ( south ) tower and it was ancient looking but 
breakfast at the restaurant was good 
we had also a very good rate for a spacious suite 
there was a good sized work desk and the room and bathroom was very clean and in good order 
it is a typical business hotel with the same typical rooms as most other higher end business chains 
the hotel location 
the hotel is exclusively located on second rood which makes it right in the hustle bustle and 
large open air corridors leading to rooms 
the subway is only a few minutes walk away and takes you downtown in no time at all 
the room was huge 
the hotel rooms are small and a bit out of date but that 's what the essex house 
the 29 'resort fee' was a bit annoying just to use the internet and the gym 
fantastic one of the best hotels in new york 
please train your colleagues 
i stayed 3 nights at ti last weekend 
the buffet had a great drinks service and the food there was solid 
this hotel is priced like the better hotels in new york ( st regis 
having your feet touch the matress is a big turn-off 
called the front desk the very next day and they moved me to another one with full front park view 
its an old property thats was redone some time ago 
bathroom was a great size with plenty of room 
the room was ok but lacked some basic facilities including complimetray bottled water and tea and coffee facilities 
the concierge was also friendly and helpful ( tho i did n't ask him for anything difficult 
location was an easy 5min walk from the central station which is convenient for us as we came from 
so i 'll complain about the overall ambience 
we had breakfast included in the room rate - and it 's wonderful 
the pool is a basic ( and remarkably small ) kidney shape pool with a hot tube and a handful 
the size of the room and the amenities were good 
typical with a ton of german breads 
the hotel simply responds that everyone is treated the same way and they ca n't do for one if 
with low facilities ( bad internet connection 
good dinner 
best hotel at mex airport 
no worries though as the friendly lady at the desk sent the shuttle right over to pick me up ( 
quite a good size but pretty basic otherwise 
very good value for money compared to other strip properties 
the reception staff were warm and welcoming 
nice older hotel 
there are plenty of places to eat on the strip if you do n't want to eat in the 
and the hotel has great restaurants and theatre right on the ground floor 
it is a fairly standard hotel with reasonable facilities 
free internet if you are an honours member 
be aware you ca n't walk anywhere , the rooms are old and tired the bars ok the only 
the only thing is the casino area is a little smoky in the evenings 
saturday night after being out all day decided to eat a late dinner in the bar 
maybe i would prefer to stay somewhere more comfortable 
the staff also gave us champagne as our welcome drink and cakes and sweets with my name on it 
and immediately upgraded us to a bigger suite at the back 
it 's an impressive building 
for the price we paid it was great value for the location and the hotel theme is fun 
miscellaneous- the roller coaster in the hotel was excellent 
it took two requests for us to receive extra towels and bathrobes 
the light rail station is also very close by 
1 ) the breakfast in the executive lounge was disappointing -- very few options and quality not befitting the 
great shower 
typical scandinavian hotel 
much higher quality than a normal business hotel ( coffee awful 
but the front desk provided us maps and made dinner reservations 
the food in the restaurant during our first evening was just passable and we found the staff quite rude 
there is not even free internet in rooms 
the bar was very lively with a young crowd dressed to impress 
a huge amount of empty bottles and glasses on the bar and two large tvs behind the bar playing 
they all appear to be the same except the few large suites and the corner rooms that have saun 
rooms are nice and modern with a really good spacious bathroom 
you could not open balcony door even one centimeter 
comfortable and contemporary decor is pretty contemporary . 
the size is quite spacious and the bed is perfect 
the restaurant service staff was friendly but the food takes way too long to be served especially i am the 
we loved the large balcony with a daybed and a open air bathtub 
i tried to get a hotel via singapore stop over holidays but at the time of booking it was 
we had asked for an extra bed during our booking however it arrived after reminding them twice 
i have stayed here in the past when i passed through singapore on a short business trip 
two weeks would be too long because of limited attractions nearby 
the service was excellent despite it being a busy time and all staff members we had any interaction with were 
it 's about 30 minutes journey to the unesco centre in the town centre , but a 
- super comfy beds- selection of pillows if you do n't like one on bed- 
comfy beds and large bathroom 
the service is excellent and the japanese restaurantmatsu is outstanding 
try setting the aircon to a lower temperature and did not work 
i found the mattress topping the wooden base too hard and uncomfortable 
friendly and professional the rooms are large and well equipped and the breakfast had a good variety of dishes and 
it does n't make for the best walking beach 
the rooms were great and the kids were very happy 
the hotel itself is very good - rooms are clean and a reasonable size 
for the right price i would say here 
same service but double the price 
this property desperately needs to do more with their staffs attitudes and teach them to be helpful and 
in the hotel great executive lounge and restaurants as well 
suggest club room for the little extra charge 
clean bathroom 
main house was also beautifully decorated 
and the complimentary wifi was good 
daily buffet breakfast was good 
will stay here again next time 
located on the edge of town next to the huegenot museum monument this gives you a great 
arranging a number of requests and the front desk staff was courteous and professional 
their breakfast buffet is expensive and they struggled to keep up with the demand 
from front desk staff 
i loved the private cottage garden that came with the suite - a nice clean plunge pool 
having completed an amazing tour of south africa 
the staff were very helpful and well mannered - food was fantastic 
food in bar is just ok-would stay here every time i come back to rome 
we reserved a double deluxe room and we were very happy with it 
i had a good rest before i participate in the sundown marathon later in the evening 
i would say a good hotel do n't expect any great service best part is when we go down 
the property upkeep was good 
the room is very comfortable 
old world charm 
this hotel is a restoration of former offices of the scotsman newspaper and is about as different from 
great hotel and great servise 
the bathroom was quite small but well appointed and the toiletries were the cowshed brand 
the bed was not very comfortable and the pillows were scratchy 
clean and with a huge bathroom and great rain shower 
i found the hotel to be excellent and especially good if you want to visit the clarke quay 
executive lounge was small with not a very good flow for food or drinks 
no problem . 
facing airport has great views 
bathrooms had a very large shower with lots of glass 
we were able to take a quick train to central station 
there is security personnel at the entrance dressed in a suit to see that hotel guest feel safe 
the club served finger food and drinks of an early evening and you could also get coffees and cool 
i also experienced a lack of hot water one morning and did n't enjoy the cold shower 
the bowery restaurant looks good but would not visit again 
evening lounge was also great with amazing snacks and top class wine 
note that it is connected to the airport however it is quite a long walk down an extremely long tunnel 
i love a hotel that has quirkiness to it - and this ticked all those boxes 
wifi is terrific and amenities are well-supplied 
this trip was a one-night business stay 
restaurants are very high standard and location is pretty good 
and it has the added benefit of a decent swimming pool and spa 
the buffet is varied but regrettably with no great service or panache here 
but it is conveniently located and does offer good value 
bit annoying that car parking costs an extra 15 but otherwise we really enjoyed our stay 
the room was clean and a good size and really good value for money 
they are so friendly and warm and full of genuine smiles 
there are much nicer resorts elsewhere that are more keen for our business 
great gym with a wonderful view of the sea 
a well maintained resort compared to resort nearby 
modern rooms 
great checkin and late checkout on request 
the bathroom was actually good size for hk 
he also stated that coffee supplies were available at the front desk not aware that i been through that already 
you can get a fabulous view of the city and the busy streets 
the service throughout is exceptional 
have stayed at this hotel several times over the years and usually choose it if needing something for a quick 
the harbor view rooms are good but traffic can be heard even on the much higher floors ( 20 ) 
otherwise you can buy at desk just outside the terminal area 
my experience was that as a relatively new hotel the public areas and rooms are clean and modern in design 
the lady also offered us coffee due to the delayed in checked in 
brilliant blackout blind 
there are many restaurants and eateries nearby 
a fan ( apologies madarin ) of aman we had to visit for one night and yes it 
to top off the food issues 
the room is lovely with dark wood floors and the largest bed i ever slept in 
the room was wonderful in traditional bhutan style and the main buffet restaurant an amazing space too 
do n't expect western luxury as this is far from it but will certainly suffice for bhutan 
upgraded to a semi-suite with nice front harbor view and lounge access 
my only criticism is on the cleanliness side - they need to clean toilet floors 
also at the end of our long day they drew us a warm relaxing bath 
the main lobby and main restaurants are freezing 
the 2 restaurants are both excellent 
they are very accomendating . 
this property is a great value down the mrt line a couple stops from central ( about an 8 
also tram stop is about 300m and worth riding that double deck tram 
but the property was so lovely and the service so spectacular that we could n't resist posting a review 
but it was the people who worked there treated us like royalty 
loved the rooms which are large 
quality of food very good - breakfast and dinners you have a choice between indian - very good as 
i particularly like the outside courtyard restaurant area with great food ( try the egg white omelettes 
the hotel staffs were friendly and for the most part very competent 
they are building one close to hotel ( not sure when will be completed ) 
it may not be the best value in town 
this property has several bird species - peacocks 
we again found this oberoi to be excellent with fantastic food and service 
tram and cheap taxis made the location a non-issue and the room rates were definitely lower than 
also there are several laundry outlets 
you feel as if you are in a secluded country retreat and the individually clustered groups of rooms add 
the location is perfect 
that is not a euphemism for small or dated -- my premier room is very large and has good 
was a comparable property 
nice green gardens and maze-type lanes make it an oasis in the desert 
well on my second trip to istanbul 16 years later 
great size too 
and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the local area 
the bathroom was very large & lovely 
at the end of each short trip away from istanbul we were looking forward to going back to 
the concierge is a real gem 
it is located right in the middle of the old city 
enjoyed the squid salad for starter but not the hanoi style grilled fish 
- tv reception was fuzzyunfortunately due to the ridiculously hard beds 
we arrived at 6am and our suite was ready and we requested a late ( 4pm ) check 
the rooms are upgraded and comfortable 
only complaint - we did n't have the opportunity to stay longer 
ultra-comfortable bedroom . 
and on tops of that you get full size perfumes 
your average business hotel 
having a dedicated butler for the small number of suites on our floor was also a great service as 
and would not have been able to walk out of the bathroom without cutting my feet on glass 
you can walk to gurney plaza shopping mall which is next to the hotel via a sheltered walk 
room is big and has a nice view of the fireworks from straits quay so you do n 
i watched a documentary on the building of this several years back and increased my experience and awe when i 
and there are many facilities nearby including a shopping centre nearby and many hawker stalls and restaurants on g 
the outside lunch menu is a little disappointing 
it is truly a unique setting on a man made island near the famous palm island 
they were speedily rectified luckily . 
free soft drinks 
the rooms' design is completely overloaded with everything one might consider expensive - and the style is catering r 
the suites are great and their new pool is so amazing 
the property also next to gurney plaza - hip place to be in penang 
bath shower has good water pressure 
valet parking was great very friendly team as is front desk 
the free juice in the mini bar was a nice touch 
the amenities were good 
one additional good point of the hotel is that the mini bar is stocked with complimetary drinks and 
lovely couch 
and the smell is like aged steak throughout the whole wing 
but the morning we checked out i went in to see and they actually did have hot food 
same floor was accorded 
the hotel is closed to gurney plaza which we spent a lot of time in this mall 
we had the buffet breakfast which was excellent 
and bathtub and toilet are separate from the vanity area 
we left our camera in the room safe after we checked out and they were very helpful in getting it 
the decor is dated but clean and on par with other holiday inns 
it was also a decent size although i was only on the 3rd floor so had a fairly un 
very comfortable bed with pillow menu available 
as i left early before breakfast 
we had a nice stay here with our kids 
amongst other up-market shopping complexes and commercial buildings 
the bedroom has been nicely decorated and the bed is good 
room service was very good and great value 
you run the chance of late night and early morning noise from the street so ask for a room at 
the buffet breakfast was excellent quality and great food choice 
a spacious lounge dining area with colour tv and cd player 
clean and cheap massage place called marsheanda- few local food or western food 10-15 mins 
right opposite sentral station is the plus plus 
only good place to relax is bar on the beach and spa for bali massagei also canceled another 
it was the center of all public transportation 
a good pool 
the gym is pretty decent as is the pool area ( which is shared with the adjacent hilton ) 
the pool is huge and never felt really crowded 
no separate shower cubicle 
the welcome drink was a mint tea followed by ginger tea post massage 
but unfortunately this connection does not stretch to the airport 's low cost carrier terminal 
large window for great views while taking a bath 
i stayed in the 3 bedroom apartment which was nice and spacious 
conveniently located at the train station 
high floor room is a must to enjoy the view 
there was a king sized bed with both firm and fluffy pillows 
the facilities like the gym are ok 
new furnishings are complete and go above and beyond what is expected of a five-star hotel 
you can take the airport express train from airport to sentral station 
you can check-in at the station ( drop your luggage ) 
all in all - is a good location hotel with contemporary modern rooms 
the front desk asked me to call their corporate office myself 
want to stay in central kl this is an excellent place to stay 
it also offers good restaurants and efficient service levels 
one large building ) and they share facilities - so you get a gym that rivals exceeds many commercial gy 
there were none left unless i wanted twin single beds 
good neighborhood with some bars and quick bite places 
with complimentary drinks and food throughout the day 
but beware of rooms facing the construction on the tower next door 
rooms are of decent size 
coming from airport is convenient about 30mins 35rm 
lots of nice restaurants around the area 
stanley park close for a good walk 
it is connected to central train station where a two min walk puts you anywhere quickly on the new metro 
from the front desk to the club lounge 
this one in is the central of city 
the bathroom was also large 
there also is a great selection of different juices and healthy smoothies available 
the pool is huge with a waterslide 
good toiletries and the bed gave me two nights of comfortable sleep 
this is a large hotel- it has nice public spaces and plenty of room to sit and lounge in 
it just a step away from the klia express which can transfer you to klia in 28 minutes 
we got a late checkout which was incredibly helpful as our flights were quite late 
the gym is quite large with new equipment 
and prime is good but quite expensive just for steak 
this hotel very bad service 
do n't lift expectations too high for the rooms 
the lobby is modern and impressive 
rooms look a little dated compared to the newly refurbished rooms at the hilton though it was extremely 
bathroom also spacious and in good condition 
near water tower place so close to shopping 
a few minor complaints 
shuttle from the terminal was convenient and regular 
reception was friendly and quick as there was no one checking in at the same time as me 
the bathrooms have been revamped too and the shower is great 
a fabulous pool 
suite clean and pleasant to be in 
very nice property 
i do appreciate the large amount of counter space that makes the bathroom very functional while traveling 
the drivers of the buses were like something out of a horror film - obnoxious 
special to mention is the excellent coffee machine ( very rare in the us ) 
the level of consistency of this property is outstanding 
however i was coming in on a late flight and had to take a cab ( or wait half 
the hotel is a dump - old 
can usually get a great package deal that includes parking ( so much cheaper than any other airport parking 
the hotel is right around the corner of the central station and cityterminalen 
the breakfast had a few different choices and was very good 
slightly on the high side in terms of costs but low on hilton benefits 
add free internet for loyalty card members and it 's a good deal 
beautiful views for the top floor 
this one is right on top of the main train station 
at a reasonable price 
they even gave us a free cocktail 
the bed was particularly comfortable and the blinds were pretty good 
we had chosen water view superior room 
is very close ( 200 yards ) to the central train station so you can hop to from the airport 
the hotel is in walking distance to nearly every main attraction in prague and there are dozens of terrific 
old town and other sites 
also the room tariff is quite low 
one night i ordered room service and they put a lot of effort into it 
both the cafe one and the breakfast one 
great outside bar 
i think you could either get the same quality in a much cheaper hotel or pay a slight premium for 
very nice fitness center 
rooms are good size and comfortable but need renovation desperately 
- check in was made easy . 
looking forward to my next visit 
front desk staff are very professional dealing with guests 
location is easy walking distance to three malls and many eating places 
the pool looked really good 
with great ambiance throughout 
a convenience store is available at the ground floor 
the next morning the perfume was gone and i smelled the strong tobacco smoke 
reside in an area where traffic is heavy during the day 
although my first contact with the concierge was a little disappointing 
staff at reception were very helpful 
there is also a mcdonalds within a short walking distance at the back of the hotel 
spa is excellent and treatments are the best 
food venues are a little pricey but good too 
impressive lobby public areas 
very nice swimming pool 
but the value for what you get is quite good 
the suite was decorated like a motel room 
but oddly enough after i mentioned in passing at check-out that i like those rooms i was put 
it 's a decent walk to the convention center but it is possible 
the decor of the hotel is great and everything is well maintained and comfortable 
good airport hotel bar is fine . 
there are enough towels to open a small store 
our rooms were fabulous 
book early for good price 
the price for the accommodation provided is atrocious 
hop in and they will take you where you need to go within a certain distance in class and comfort 
i can see why they had the blinds closed when we walked in 
the front desk & restaurant staff wereall very nice 
the lobby was decent and the concierge and front desk staff were really helpful 
an italian shower 
dirty tables 
and the walls are not thick enough to block out the sounds of a couple clearly enjoying some time away 
the beds were phenomenal and the bathroom of our suite was with an exceptional large shower bath in nice dark 
located right at the airport so you can easily walk from the airport terminals and it is very easy 
this hotel has little to offer 
the room was great and clean and the staff were very friendly and accommodating so all in all a good 
modern rooms including fully-stocked kitchenettes 
the hotel is also located 5 minutes to the train station which takes you 
breakfast was nice and staffed by friendly and helpful personnel 
i go to copenhagen quite a lot and this will be my defalut choice for late arrivals 
club lounge is cosy and service is perfect 
had access to the exec lounge which had a great breakfast and snacks and drinks throughout the day 
i can imagine the public beach would get extremely busy at the weekends and when the weather is n't 
one of the two authentic japanese restaurants in abu dhabi is at this hotel 
breakfast was in the executive lounge with a good buffet and eggs etc 
the hilton abu dhabi is a fine choice if you do not want to be near the 
wifi is expensive but location of the hotel for transit travellers is excellent 
i had n't really considered coming back to this hotel once it stopped being a hilton 
has its own beach and access with plenty of bars and also restaurants in side the hotel 
a large desk with three work chairs 
the hotel is right next to the airport too so didnt have to take luggage too far from airport terminal 
my last airport hilton experiece was at london 's gatwick a few months ago 
and have only very basic amenities 
location 5 5service 5 5rooms 5 5food 5 5value 5 5staff 5 5the only 
with bars and eateries adjacent 
and in such a tiny bathroom why do they need a tinier bath tub in which only a baby 
a 24 hours availabilty of front desk 
the decor feels old 
having read the positive reviews for it 
the room was spacious with a decent view of the atrium and the bed was extremely comfortable 
it is massive and noisy with waterfalls ( and alligators ) and the humidity is high in public 
small work desk 
the service is the achilles heel here as the property is very nice 
apparently they keep the temperature comfortable for the employees 
chef even prepares vegetarian options live 
the room was modern and very nice with view to the garden and pool the only downside is they could 
the strand is a small cozy hotel 
he preceded to laugh about the situation and treat me like it was a storm in a tea cup 
nice view from the caf located within the hotel 
the gym was adequate but very crowded 
rooms were clean and staff was efficient 
the breakfast was limited and i felt expensive 
internet worked easily and there was enough space to work 
ask for an ocean view room and remember that when you open the balcony doors 
which is the top floor on the northern corner 
they also run a free shuttle every hour 
the shuttle bus is a great service and the driver ben was a great guy to have a chat to 
the location is great 
the bar has an amazing selection of wines and champagne and the restaurant serves a delicious schnitzel 
the room was lovely and we particularly enjoyed the comfy bed and lovely bathroom 
sans souci was an equally wonderful facility 
the lobby was small and the design was a bit tacky 
better views could possibly be had on higher floors but then the cost may have been more 
the property is nice and leafy 
that 's unnecessary when costs are in local currency 
true the hotel may need some touch up here and there 
the staff can help you to get a taxi to where you are going 
the food was ok and the spa was ok but neither were great 
the beds may be quite hard by western standards but i 've always gotten a good nights sleep 
breakfast was good spread 
the spa was good although limited as i could not get a 90 min deep tissue massage only 60min 
breakfast buffet was great 
regal kowloon is in a good spot away from the super busy streets of tst 
but overall we had a very nice stay at this hotel and would recommend the club floor rooms 
thankfully the area is quite good with some nice cafes and a supermarket nearby 
this relaxed atmosphere made for a good place to chill out in the shade by the pool after a busy 
the bed was quite hard and the pillows equally uncomfortable 
very comfortable and relaxing 
breakfast is of a high level in a cosy restaurant with outside terrace 
local traditional snack plate and the nightcaps that were delivered before bedtime 
the gym is great 
it is also an easy walk to the nathan road shopping street 
the harbour promenade is a short walk from the hotel 
the hotel was busy for many guests checking in and out . 
there are also some nice restaurants in the neighborhood and it is about 6 minutes to mts shim 
i must fairly admit that the breakfast spread is amazing and tempting for another try 
big hotel 
can surely say that this hotel is a wonderful place for a business and a leisure stay 
all in all a good hotel and fairly decent value for money 
chinese restaurant at the hotel has made me their fan and one of the authentic chinese food available 
there is a small gym and a nice small pool too 
breakfast spread was nice 
the front desk office was responsive with adequate english which is very helpful especially you are in china 
right on the main shopping pedestrian street 
has a little park which leads to pearl river 
the buffet breakfast was nice and the staff spoke good english 
you are on the pedestrian shopping street nad withing walking distance from interesting sights 
mia in premium lounge had perfect service attitude and she was prime example of nice myanmar people - 
ok hotel with all the facilities you need 
excellent value resort accommodation in a great location 
big thai spa 
all were top notch 
check-in at the executive lounge on 16th floor was pleasant 
french restaurant was not very nice to be honest but i heard good things about so i might have 
godd gy and good swiming pool 
good hotel not great location 
actually the bathroom was my biggest gripe due to its lack of privacy and awkward design 
we chose the central plaza after reading some great reviews and we were not disappointed 
loved the pool - even warm enough for this time of year 
the grounds are good for a walk and nicely kept 
the buffet was good although the scrambled eggs were shockingly bad and the egg chef refused to make us ones 
with a very nice bathroom and a really nice feel - under the eaves 
private pool is very big 
the staff are friendly and the resort is good value for money 
i 'd book the hotel only if the room rate was better 
modern airport hotel with very comfortable and well-designed rooms 
excellent resort with good staff and excellent food 
one of the best hotels i have been to 
we also loved cocktail happy hour at the beach restaurant 
the breakfast buffet was good 
i actually needed to have a meeting with a couple of colleagues and the room worked out well 
in general it felt like that the hotel was trying to cut costs and there was really a lack of 
bed ok , not great . 
we spoke to the front desk about this and they rectified the problem 
great restaurants inside and a step outside 
although not a separate tub 
the staff were very helpful and assisted us in arranging for car hire 
two of the lamps could n't be turned on because they have us plugs and there were no adapters 
proximity to bommie restaurant and a five minute stroll to the majority of restaurants 
food is of a high quality 
the beds were great 
you will be offered a buggy for your whole stay usage which is very convenient 
was nicely decorated with a great view of the area the furniture was classic and comfortable and nicely appointed 
indisputably the best resort in the world 
large balcony 
our bungalow was set in the natural woodland overlooking the bay and had a large balcony with two 
the concierge was very helpful both before and during our stay 
i do n't think i 've had a better massage anywhere ( thank you damien ) 
breakfast and lunch were great on each occasion that i ate there 
rooms are spacious and very nice 
the room is pretty average - i thought it would be more luxurious -nice amenities but shower pressure is 
whilst the cost is significant you do receive excellent service and the facilities are the best on the island 
they have small toilets 
there are other restaurant options available at the marina and within the other resorts on hamilton island 
was an amazing resort 
stay here you wont be disappointed 
choice at breakfast was reasonable 
this hotel has a great location and the staff was good 
w hotel is much better 
we found the service very slow 
the complimentary buffet was a bit spartan and it took a while to realize the egg-cook 
but walk around away from the main tourist streets & you 'll find lots of others 
it 's a bit out of the way for the old town 
the food was spectacular and i just ca n't wait to go back 
there are three large swimming pools and several jacuzzies 
great shops and restaurants very close 
there is a free general airport shuttle or you can walk from the airport to the hotel 
this is a great hotel to stay in if you are visiting buenos aires 
good reliable shuttle 
comfortable hotel with great amenities 
while we only had dinner one night at gioia 
it was ok and definetely a nicer property but the cost of parking 
but very friendly helpful concierge and prompt check-in staff 
it will be so bitter to explain how mistreated we were by the night shift front desk staff 
the cold selections and juice bar are great 
concierge lounge very good and friendly 
got some noise from electric room make sure you ask reception beforehand when staying in a high floor 
concierge room was nice 
a very nice coffee shop that also sells scandinavian-style wooden toys just outside the front 
the alcoholic drinks are not free either and cost cad 8 and up 
the hotel gives you free internet also 
our room was spacious 
on the plus side the staff are great 
there are much chicer hotels in the area that are good for the solo traveler and since the rates 
the service was also excellent 
the room came with free wifi which is always great to have and the club sandwich i ordered late one 
all in all the property is very nice and kept up to date 
the front desk staff is friendly and outgoing 
everything is very walkable . 
big bathrooms ( pity about the shower curtain which i hate ) 
i have to say the public areas 
modern large rooms 
overall ok value but there are better options which i will probably take next trip 
service is good 
food quality was decent and delivery to the room was pretty fast 
i can understand that the suite upgrade not available but i do n't even get any welcome letter in 
our room was newish 
the quality of food is also good 
the restaurant was small and mostly overcrowded 
overall very good value and would return if i need something just for a quick overnight 
it is good value 
room was clean and a decent size 
the tables at the reception were peeling and needed urgent facelift2 . 
the house keeping was very average and they destroyed my expensive pair of shoes by making them drenched in 
1 ) great location if you need to be equidistant between the airport and south mumbai or 
and shower with a nice supply of hot water 
special thanks to veera whom gave me a good introduction and welcome for the hotel 
very nice property 
friendly staff 
not at all worth the extra for an upgrade 
clean linens and comfortable bed 
9 months after previous visit 
two friends of mine and i went to the rooftop bar one night ( mind you 
other reviewers were n't exaggerating - they do smell like vomit 
there are some restaurants nearby and we could easily walk everywhere 
downtown hotel for business meeting excellent choice 
great basement bar and restaurant we often use if we are in town . 
private check in out with porter and reception was very good 
so we opened a window and went out exploring venice 
but definitely worth staying 
plenty of towels and one of the best non-slip shower mats i have ever seen or 
booked through centurion and had a fabulous upgrade 
the room had a good sized desk as well as a separate table with chocolate comfortable chairs 
there are numerous restaurants nearby with great food and service plus all the upmarket shops 
i understand that the majority of hotels in venice are of venetian style however this hotel was 
the merrion hotel 's location was ideal for the work with my clients 
a great stay from start to finish 
for our short stay we did n't dine at the hotel opting instead for the local restaurants nearby 
restaurant very good though pricey but everything in venice is pricey 
there is also a 2 michelin star restaurant that you should absolutely try 
a few limited western options 
covered walkway 
the digital check out saves you so much time 
at the right price 
the club lounge and restaurants were also great 
or the opposite direction for larger park ( takes more time ) 
the location is a sturdy walk undercover to the terminal and takes about 10 minutes 
rooms are large and offer all amenities one would expect but do n't expect a nice view 
room quality is very good 
so from the 6th floor we only had a view of the office across the street 
good location close to times square and shopping mile . 
only one chocolate was left for the two of us next to the bed 
ny is rather expensive when it comes to good hotels but it is worth paying the price when you 
and so able to use the lounge for a free breakfast 
good size rooms but starting to fade 
the staffs were friendly and attentive 
the hotel is in a rural area which would be good for viewing the northern lights if the weather cooper 
in spite of the long walk 
it is a convenient walk via a covered walkway to terminal 4 
i 'm sure it makes the management feel hip and modern 
friendly staff and a quite good 
the rooms were adequate and amenities good but wifi was sluggish 
with a late flight inward to terminal 1 and an early morning departure from t4 
it lacks a bus service like most on the bath road 
in addition the internet signal was weak and was disconnected a lot 
hotel a typical airport hilton - long hike from t4 
its great for mummy and daddy as they get a real holiday ( they even offer baby sitting ) and 
our junior suite was spacious enough and the bed was comfortable 
the rooms are nicely decorated and the restaurants are surprising good for an airport hotel 
the biggest reason to stay at an airport hotel is location and convenience 
lee at the front desk appeared to have an attitude 
to wait with your luggage at the hotel and drive the car up from the carpark 
you can relax by the pool ( or the one in your suite ) or watch tv all day 
the main sights of the blue mountains like the three sisters are not nearby though 
the food was good and the room price reasonable for this location 
good but quiet aircon 
for example , a bed on wheels in a cramped up room ? 
hyatt in heart of the city located at vastrapur 
the best thing about the hilton at terminal 4 is its easy access to terminal 4 
crawled out of bed and asked to move - was moved into a very shabby room - quiet 
inefficient and inadequately staffed front desk 
all we really wanted to do have dinner quickly and go straight to sleep 
they have a good breakfast spread 
breakfast is served in the bar but whilst the food is good the room is not ideal 
it 's right by the freedom train and boston common 
i wanted a cold shower 
beds and room sizes good but it all felt a bit basic 
if you head east on the beach 
nice staff and of course that wine hour in the lobby every night 
staying on the property is very convenient 
the hilton barbados resort is a pleasant relaxing self contained tourist hotel 
in the car park on level one are too very old fiat 's rusting away - shames 
the resort is very nice 
and rooms spotless - we had the presidential suite - and we were very well looked after - nothing 
restaurants ) and the beach pool ( kids pool ) as they will be noisy 
the beach was nice 
a nice sandwich and soup type lunch can be had at the round house at bethsheba on 
the friendly lounge attendant greeted me by name 
there was not a sound or any light in the bedroom 
buffet was still full 
with a small balcony 
loved the spacious and clean bathroom 
the lobby area is stunning with the indoor forest 
the common areas are modern and the general atmosphere is refined informal elegance 
i had a chance to use the spa which is good as i used to do in the past 
the check in process was at the lounge and the lounge while ample and spacious lacks the warmth you expect 
the pool was excellent especially the one on the clifftop 
overall a great stay 
delicious breakfasts and the best location to see all the sights 
the gym size is good with adequate number of machines to choose from 
lovely quiet gardens 
ambience and the over all environment is fantastic 
i was given a top floor room though 
my husband and my 20 year old son stayed in this hotel last week 
there are several metro stations close by as well if walking is not your thing 
the hotel itself is very charmingly restored and has history nooks so you can learn more about its 
our room ( on the 2nd floor ) like many over looked an inner courtyard - extremely quiet 
you will have fairly easy cheap access to everything else in the city with the metro taxi uber 
lake views rooms better but expensive 
the most impressive hotel i know 
and free internet 
the property is beautiful 
i checked to see if the windows were open because it was so loud 
beautiful setting 
the swimming pool and the service 
serviceservice in the hotel was excellent 
the main shopping area and the harbour are short walks from this hotel and there is a free tourist bus 
recommended as excellent value for money mid-range hotel 
the pools are great 
go on upgrade yourself to a club room and live 
the sleep quality is particularly excellent as the soft pillows and bed are extremely comfortable 
kota kinabalu is the second largest city in malaysia 
free wifi at the hotel lobby 
pool is great 
where a nice mall is located 
should be better sea side is better but more expensive . 
the magellan has more interesting restaurants 
activities for guests was nice 
and overall clientele is very diversified ( japanese 
one of the few decent options for yangon 
breakfast buffet was good 
i choose this due to the really high prices wanted by the shangri-la rasa r 
there were traditional burmese foods provided as well as the more regular eggs 
quality of internet is a major factor for where i choose to stay and this trip was no exception 
wonderful breakfast buffet spread 
but they brought in some touches like wood paneling in the bathroom that gave it some charm and connection 
train station and the st 
typical quality and cleanliness for an ic 
it also has a good selection of local restaurants and a shopping centre right next to the hotel if you 
even at the reception you 'd get a refreshing welcome drink 
the property is great option for its location and good value for money 
very comfortable bed and an excellent shower 
the bathroom is very nicely appointed 
okay gym - amazing breakfast 
pillows were clean and did not smell and the orchid club with open bar for two hours every 
one side of the bedroom has a chest to put your luggage on 
and the shower was one of the best hotel showers ever 
shame i had an early flight the next day 
the hotel also does n't like to play the rewards game by stating we ca n't have upgrade 
very nice rooms 
easy access to numerous shopping malls nearby and you can get everything you need 
cant be any closer to the airport with a short stroll to check in 
that you get early morning complimentary access to as a hotel guest 
the breakfast spread was nice but the hot food that you order by the plate took ages to arrive - 
hotel also offered guest free access to harukas which was said to be the highest building of 
best airport hotel in africa 
short walk and easy check in 
the room was large and the bed was super comfy 
00 has run out of many basics . 
glass atrium lobby and pool area seem like something from the 80s 
had complimentary drinks and snacks 
- room size- modern decor & facilities- staff very helpful- spacious hotels with good restaurantsno major 
the rooms are decent size with quality and typical furnishings 
the concierge was very welcoming upon our arrival while check in at reception was friendly and organised 
bar and service are all exceptional 
it 's one of the closest hotels to msp airport ( less than 3 miles ) and they 
from the reviews it seems like some rooms are better than others 
modern and spacious 
gym was small to but had everything you needed for a basic workout 
the staff are very friendly too 
the bed was very comfortable & offered two different styles of pillow 
good layout and spacious 
the bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent 
very good apartment - location and service 
you can find great snorkeling opportunities here 
service and cleanliness are all a guarantee 
the air conditioning and the safe worked well 
i told the receptionist to make sure that my room was cleaned and that everything was working properly before 
not a big luxury 
the hotel is beautiful 
all the restaurants are good places to experiment 
also , they closed the bar for a private function which meant ridding the lift up to the 
the lobby is small and can resemble a railway station when crowded 
within cbd and minutes from circular key and the rocks and close to buses for bondi etc 
there are plenty of good cuban latin food places close by 
a desk and a chair little room for not including you luggage 
the fitness center is located in the courtyard by marriott 
i visited your restaurant at 5 
this hotel is located in close proximity to the airport and they offer free shuttle service throughout the day 
2 double beds did ( alternative was one king & roll up beds ) 
we had a function at one of the ballrooms and the service and food was first rate 
only guests with the hotel room card access can slide a panel in the lift in order to access to 
including massage below and all manner of goods and services above 
simple rooms and huge hotel but quite inconvenient as i need to change lifts etc 
on weekend there are always activities around the rock area that you can enjoy 
eric from horizon club and frontdesk is a good staff team 
the hotel access to senayan shopping mall and short walk to stadium 
the lobby was huge but lack of soul 
what can i say wow 'what a view' and it made us two seasoned travellers feel quite emotional 
the hotel organised a van to fetch 4 of us from the airport after a long international flight 
you need a room below 18 on the floor you are staying 
and wifi is free 
the breakfast buffet was good quality 
very nice touch 
gym was spacious with good equipments 
the price was a little high but with a faultless stay i could n't complain 
our room was spacious 
our suite was so large and spacious 
had really old wallpaper that was peeling in areas 
this hotel is well appointed with amenities for a great stay and not to mention the free mini bar 
next lived up to expectations with the little touches the cream of the experience 
the shower was great 
very pleasant staff but it just does n't quite make it - e 
-free movies - what is not to love-room was very clean and bed was comfy 
the hotel became very 'stingy' about the upgrades - having patronized shangri- 
the work done in the lobby is nicely done 
the bathroom was a nice size with large counter space and a good bathtub 
the beetroot minimal 
up in the air located on top of the hill overlooking the rocks district this is the place to stay 
( far better value than bewleys hotel ballsbridge 
and ( if you are fortunate and arrive early ) free parking in front of the building 
the check-in staff were very helpful and overall this was a good stay in a business hotel and 
some small items have been broken already but i am sure that these will be rectified prior to the 
on weekends there is also a delightful little market to walk around shop and people watch 
i waited for a drink at altitude for 40 mins and the staff were incredibly rude 
and pool members all took the time to strike up friendly conversation and make the visit more personal and relaxing 
only stay there if you get a deal 
) regular rooms- weird 
initially i had booked for 2 nights but due to a change of plans had to leave the next 
go to the bar on the top of the hotel and enjoy the fabulous view of the sydney 
generous hospitality and professional manner really helped make our stay even more special 
the gym was large and had great equipment 
not only will u get high floors ( 30th floor and above ) 
horizon lounge was excellent - great service every single day 
the location is perfect for sightseeing and the view over the harbour ( bridge and opera house ) from 
it was impeccably decorated and provided a warm relaxing atmosphere - like a cosy pied a ter 
in addition the mini bar was making a weird noise the whole time 
i found the walk to the harbour area acceptable 
the evening carollers & bounteous wine glasses offered to guests - no little plastic 4 oz non 
the front deck staff are very helpful and were happy to give me another room when the original smelt 
i have stayed here several times over the past few years and it is always a good experience 
the rooms are okay 
check in took a while as a lot of tourists as you would expect in sydney 
the refrigerator and in-room safe were of good size 
my new fav hotel in sydney 
despite being told at check in that room service was available 
the tram stop is right outside the hotel and the ride is about 1 2 hour into the old town 
food options in the hotel are good 
by contrast the rooms at aureum were much more lavishly decorated rooms and the general hotel layout 
nice beds ( albeit only doubles in the 2 bedded rooms ) and the free doubletree check- 
wonderful setting 
beds comfy as were pillows 
towels old and worn 
the shops and public transport are very close in walking distance and the food in the hotel is quite good 
hotel itself is in the old town and close to metro station 
the tower is a monstrosity but it gives the most amazing views at all times of the day 
internet ( wi-fi ) is free in the lobby and at the pool 
khasab is worth a short visit 
the setting is beautiful ( pagodas at sunset ) 
then this is the only hotel 
it is a beautiful place with huge suites - large enough for several people if they included more beds 
breakfast was n't great at all such a shame but the snacks and cocktails were good 
and moved me down the other end of the hall ( and delivered a great night 's rest for 
good air conditioning system 
we were given welcome drinks 
this retreat on the 35th floor gives your tremendous mountain views and great place to do work with complimentary 
meeting rooms and space were very efficient and close by to all activities and the restaurant on 4 was 
did not manage to check out on the gym but there is actually an indoor heated pool in the hotel 
the black out curtains could n't be closed all the way and did n't reach the floor and 
more a resort intercontinental malta , more a resort - plus , - the manager lior- 
the club lounge is lovely with a large terrace for eating breakfast outside 
the club lounge is great and has an all day offering and both the breakfast and the evening drinks and 
restaurants and the 16th street mall ( tacky but convenient if you need a drugstore 
there is valet parking at the hotel but we found it more convenient for coming and going to park 
our helpful desk clerk let us know that there is free wireless available in the lobby and so i brought 
got before check-in time and they couldnt find the reservation 
the hotel has an outdoor swimming pool offering breath taking views 
the room i booked was a spacious suite with a large balcony with a partial view of the surrounding areas 
a decent hotel in genoa 
free internet access is also available from the lounge however the connection is very slow 
only worked properly in the lobby 
my room was on the 82nd floor and the view was spectacular especially at night with all the lights 
good value plus bc connector bus from victoria to this hotel made transfer so easy 
the showers were great once you figure out how to turn them on 
-good service-bus stop outside the hotel-it 's across the street from 7-e 
bell boys looked completely flummoxed at the coach full of luggage that they had to deliver - 
great view from high floor room 
there is complimentary access to steam room and pool in basement floor 
the food is amazing and the attention to detail is 100 percent nothing like kuta and a trip back 
clean and tastefully decorated 
we love a good breakfast 
the breakfast buffet was great 
although would have been nicer if the pool water was a bit warmer 
at the front desk at check-out 
good bed and pillows but very sloppy housekeeping 
surrounding area of the hotel has good view 
denfinatly the best hotel i have ever stayed in 
scary expensive , full-service 5star hotel in the pudong clouds title says it all 
front desk staff was great about getting us a room even though we checked in early 
with probably the best shower of my trip 
just a good 5mins walk away to most major shops and pike market 
nice bathroom but hard to keep water temperature stable in the morning which is little inconvenience 
this meant that we missed out on the welcome champagne 
stayed with my partner at this hotel for 3 nights 
very easy access to shopping 
i found the front desk staff to be quite helpful with all of my requests - the hotel does n 
alluring bar with amazing embroidery 
nice facilities 
the shower was tiny and difficult to maneuver in 
the outdoor pool gets very crowded and the restaurant is good but the highlight for us was the use of 
the best hotel someone can stay 
very good value for money with everything you look for in an old world luxury hotel in a city 
the spa facilities are available free of charge to all hotel guests 
although the front desk can be difficult and almost every time i check out i see someone arguing with them 
i found the service consistently very good and helpful and i had no problems whatsoever with housekeeping or tur 
apostolos knows all the best restaurants and more important how to get you a reservation 
we booked dinner in the roof top restaurant which has a fantastic views of the acropolis 
this accommodation is amazing - a true riad that is a treat for the eyes 
a lovely pool 
wonderful property 
that would be my main reason for choosing a different hotel next time 
there is free wifi in the main building 
the wifi is only available in the restaurant or reception area 
average we stayed here in august 2013 for one night . 
the breakfast was delicious with an array of hot and cold choices 
the supper and breakfast ( buffet-style ) were good 
very spacious bathrooms and efficient room service 
the corridors are full of historic paintings and illustrations 
the pool looked great but we didnt have time to use it 
the best feature of gb is the fantastic view from the roof top restaurant 
prior to staying at this hotel i had read the negative reviews on trip advisor and was a bit 
it 's certainly not worth it to pay 30 extra just for a higher floor with the same side 
the breakfast room bar on the roof top in front of the acropolis is remarkable 
rooms are spacious and elegant with extremely comfortable furnishings 
it 's luxurious and it 's location is second to none 
the only area where this hotel is not good is 
the gym facilities are great and the food in wok mee is good 
the positives first 
the hotel is in a good location for tourism 
this was a good description as the double bed was against one wall and the person on the inside had 
the gym is typical of most hotels - minimal equipment and under utilised 
room was ok but internet costs and cost for 1 set laundry tokens ( 16sd ) very high 
great for tourists on a budget who want to be centrally located 
so pretty easy access to all of central london 
tidy and the location is second to none for london 
room was a decent size with a single bed 
i took a swim in the pool early in the morning 
the hotel is old and may be some part needs maintenance nevertheless everything in the room working without any trouble 
it was clean the maids are not to blame but it is dire need of decorating with dirty 
railway station atmosphere negates excellent site 
bed was comfortable with a firm mattress and the bathroom was clean 
and excellent amenities 
the staff here are amazing 
book early on the hotel 's own website for the best prices 
this grand old hotel in the hear of the theatre district in london feels very much like an ocean 
has good free internet and the lobby has newspapers to take away including daily telegraph and times 
on top of the wonderful location and nice decor 
one of the three lifts did n't work and therefore getting to and from the room could take a 
nearby to tube and in a safe area 
room was clean with a good view of the st 
room nothing special but has what you need 
a desk and a chair and a mini fridge is all you would get 
the spa is also superb and we had amazing massages which truly were unique and memorable 
they kindly upgraded us to a beach villa complete with some bubbly which made our sunset cocktails experience 
the hotel is well located for restaurants for meals 
the room was large and very modern and the bathroom was a good size 
beach front is usually best option 
given the high price and the aman name 
go to the pizza place at the picnic area which is open only till late afternoon 
modern facilities 
cosy & great room service just off the main road , this holiday inn surprises with singing choir during 
although the one time we used the 'hotels own taxi 's'i was charged thrice 
holiday inn al barsha - is a great hotel that offers good value for the services and the conf 
the pool was great and the property was well located in the upper village 
if you are looking for the best accommodation in whistler look no more 
with a good sized bathroom too 
from valet to front desk to restaurants to ski concierge 
just a two minute walk from the hotel there are some take-away options which are very good value 
nice price 
the area the hotel is in is a mix of hotels and residential 
the garden area and cafe are lovely and the breakfast buffet is a great way to start a weekend 
cool damp towels and ice cream sundaes on saturdaysno staff member ever offered to set up 
due to unforeseen circumstances we have had to cancel our much anticipated trip to canada next month 
this building is close to the hotel and has its own parking 
why not have adults-only pool-time or even a quiet section of the dining room 
guest relations and room service really bent over backward which is why in the end i give the place 
rooms were of high quality 
the service is great 
rooms ample and clean 
overall a good stay and i would definitely come back 
the sound of footsteps is very loud in the rooms ( if that 's the kind of thing that 
catering for all diets and i defy anyone to leave their breakfast room hungry or dissatisfied 
the gym is simple and could use some free weights 
this hotel was a palace and it shows in the original middle building with beautiful meeting rooms and the large 
had booked online and secured a good rate but was offered a deal on checkin . 
the breakfast was good and the reception staff were helpful with local attraction queries 
hotel also only a short walk from queen street mall also 
the location is good for the village and within walking distance to the grocery store and the small shopping center 
it 's the wifi that is expensive 
the corridors look like 1 star and the doors to the rooms and inside all need a good paint 
rooms good size and all the mod cons 
hotel is only a short walk frm the arctic sea 
with elegant design and modern clean amenities 
the following morning when my meal did n't arrive at the requested time i called the front desk to 
the spa area was great and gym nice and clean and well appointed 
quiet check-in area 
i worked at a table next to the couch but it was a little bit far for my notebook charger 
floor to ceiling windows have excellent tint and are well noise cancelled 
the hotel has excellent meeting facilities 
i would have ranked sleep quality as very good if not for the pillows 
great breakfast buffet 
this is a very comfortable luxury hotel with top grade staff who 
and yet easy to access all that dc has to offer 
king deluxe rooms are large and include a separate family room work area 
the property was well located in george town and was in an excellent area of the city 
excellent service 
the lobby is large and beautiful 
front desk was helpful and friendly 
but about as far from the metro as you can get in the nw dc area on the east 
but the hallways looked like they had n't seen a vacuum for some time and many of the 
french windows 
breakfast and dinner in the hotel was excellent with ample quality choices 
all luxury facilities and business centre . 
the room was tiny with tiny little tables and chairs all squeezed together 
the pool is spectacular and great for cooling down after a day sightseeing 
we did n't feel like we were in the heart of the city yet were able to go out 
and it had magnificent views of the adjacent park and in the distance 
with the nice large shower and flat screen tv 
bathroom is also vert spacious with quality of towels and toileteries provided 
as others have observed this hotels is a disappointment if you are expecting anthing like the singapore r 
i told the lady in the reception and they rectify the situation on the following day 
the hotel is not right in town but very cheap to get a tuk tuk to pub street 
the bathroom was also small and appeared even smaller due to the bath and sink having been set in really 
we had a suite in the old part of the hotel overlooking the pool which was very nice 
some are very expensive by western standards - but if you can give the us imported steak a miss ( 
it 's actually a bit disconcerting since it makes your skin red 
the buffet breakfast was plentiful appealing to visitors who like ramen 
the rooms are simple and very elegant and even though it is an old hotel 
the dinner buffet is a mess 
sparkling wine included in the buffet was a nice touch for our last day 
rooms are spacious and well appointed . 
with a very very musty damp smell 
we had dinner at the azie restaurant and the waitress was too busy standing there and listening to live 
excellent marble bathrooms 
a little decorative textile with happy honeymoon from the raffles siem reap was waiting on the bed 
the communal areas also looked well presented 
one of the finest hotels you 'll ever stay in 
a very attractive building with good public spaces and a fine swimming pool 
great kids club and calm water area on the beach for the little ones 
its massive swimming pool set in lush gardens 
the hotel has an old world charm with great service to match 
the beds are great 
we do n't usually like buffets 
spacious room - living room with adjoining well-stocked kitchenette with full-size fridge and 
convenient to local restaurants 
we stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms and welcomed the hotel 's change of heart as 
the gym is pretty standard but clean and well equipped and the rooms and always clean 
will when we arrived we were shown to our table and then rico 
our spacious apartment on the top floor provided a wonderful view of claisebrook cove 
i believe its a brand new refurbished room incredible amenities and free gifts and we enjoyed the grounds using 
we left for the airport very early ( before breakfast ) 
i said it had a strange smell - i will get some air freshner was the reply 
checking that you are ok 
but it 's not typical of what one expects from a top notch american hotel 
but that should be a plus and the jumeirah beach should be able to stand by itself 
great location 
the staff at the reception were friendly 
i could only work out how to do the electric block out curtain on one window though so light came 
after looking around tripadvisor i decided on the jumeirah beach hotel as the reviews were 
the breakfast buffet was good 
rooms are spacious as well as the bathroom that comes with bath tub 
the people at the desk had better understanding of basic english 
it is part of bigger complex with other hotels same group sofitel and grand mercure 
instead it was really pool facing with noisy kids screaming their heads off 
start of our holiday good drive from the airport valet parking was friendly as was the check inn- 
a ideal place to bring a family for a weekend trip for a affordable price 
the pool was large and clean 
slightly worn carpeting and small bath are what let the rooms down and like with most ryd 
the internet was fast and free and worked well in the room 
lobby bar area large but it was chilly so they had some very welcome fires lit 
hotel definitely needs a makeover . 
the rooms have a fantastic vieuw but are small and basic 
the hotel has a very nice foyer 
eventually we were able to clear things up after some back and forth over email and in person at 
excellent bathroom with a good supply of toiletries 
convenient but with poor service staff 
we had lunch and dinner in the restaurant since you need a cab to go into town and it did 
safe plus ample space for an open suitcase 
upgrade to a junior suite - the rooms are overall bigger and they seem to be away from the 
the mould in the shower ( room 1307 ) is a health hazard 
we are finding the location to be convenient but parking charges are racking up 
i highly recommend criterion which is a short walk away 
as the beach is completely private you wo n't be bothered by any merchants 
the two restaurants ( both excellent ) 
the napasai is a beautiful resort set against a hillside overlooking the sea 
decent size 
this is probably one of the best hotels i ever stayed 
the toiletries and the sheer opulence of the room ( never before have i worked on a desk 
bravo to you all and thank you for making my first visit to oslo a memorable one 
highly recommended if you want to experience true fine dining 
i neglected to review the hotel the first time around when i remember being very well taken care of by 
with a massive bathroom and a big terrace overlooking la 
the room that we stayed in was on the ninth floor and absolutely beautiful 
ask for a room away from traffic noise - no double glazing means you do get constant noise if 
15 pm and after checking in was looking forward to order some reasonable food in room after 10 hours flight 
ask for a quiet room 
a room on the 2nd floor was opened for breakfast 
the check in was flawless it has a great la vibe cool but not pretentious i loved the large 
and a cute little balcony 
the room was nice 
it hotels like this that remind you of what a five-star hotel should be 
as i was traveling alone this time i did not need to stay in one of our regular hotels in 
the view are not as great as other hotels but you just feel so good in 
it is such a shame they cannot deal with this up front - other hotels of this class do 
i cannot recommend the hotel enough for resort living close to the city 
rome his a great walkable city with fantastic coffee shops every few metres to stop 
but if there is something to be worked out is that the waiters on the breakfast buffet were very 
decent shopping 
to the point of arranging special meals for our child 
being lifetime gold will never know if we would have got a better room without paying the additional 
decor of the main areas was decent 
there are many fine restaurants located within walking distance of the hotel 
the carpets and curtains where disgustingly dirty and old 
el nido did allow us to use some of the lost nights as extras once we checked in 
activities available are table tennis 
i was a little concerned that the building next door was being renovated and it would be noisy but didnt 
ryan and bridget from the front desk were both professional and friendly 
the decor and furnishing was very tasteful and seemed to be very distinctive to the hotel ( almost 
room was comfortably large but bathroom was a bit of a squeeze 
the amenities are superb and have some extras that i have not seen anywhere else aside from india 
their gym was good and well appointed with an instructor present 
the park hyatt circular quay area is a little quiet at night 
especially the buffet and the amazing food selection 
i like the complete ambience and feel of this hotel 
one big complaint i have is that the hotel does n't give complimentary wifi 
service levels at these restaurants is good too 
which was very good with friendly and competent service 
out door pool-if you can stand the heat 
the rooms are very nice 
all really nice quality and soft bedding 
but the quality is worth paying for 
however upon checking out the same manager who i challenged quoted they tried to contact us the previous day 
this resort is very spread out so can get lost easily 
our biggest complaint was the bus service 
the serving is substantial and quality impeccable 
but my children said that the food was okay 
wonderful view on the sydney opera house from the balcony with nice chairs and table 
beautiful decor 
the rooms are spacious and very plush and comfortable 
very warm reception 
the lobby is just spectacular and the forest inside the atrium with the water falls are fun to look 
a great harbor view room makes this a 5 star hotel 
the smaller size and the recent total refurbishment the hotel has undergone give it a more boutique hotel feel 
nice and impressive hotel with a breathtaking huge lobby area with 3 ships hanging from the ceiling around the restaurant 
we ended up one floor higher up which was preferable but the view was largely obscured by a large tree 
gh dxb is a very big property and has some really nice pools 
the automatic curtains would not close all the way 
we also went for dinner one night 
the waiter being pretty useless and getting my gluten free requests all wrong 
beautiful bathrooms and state of the art technology 
our room came standard with a balcony overlooking the harbour and the opera house and it was quite spacious with 
a big desk 
you are very close to the metro which you can take if you like to get around 
it a great treat 
the room had a large window overlooking the 3 swimming pools and the sea beyond 
nice and central so easy to walk to all the main bits 
there is a large airy lobby with plenty of plants and other decorations 
the bathrooms were large 
i counted more then 7 different restaurants and steles but i guess there are more 
the wox restaurant served good value noodle 
the pool is another good feature of this hotel - beautiful and spacious 
it is nicely situated for long walks around the beautiful surrounding countryside 
and the free drinks in the evening are a very nice treat 
the staff graciously arranged an early checkin with no problems and the complimentary train station shuttle bus was 
lunch in the grand lobby with comfortable chairs and privacy is a treat 
a good espresso machine where you can have good espressos capuccinos is also available 24 hours 
and better trained staff 
the hotel is a relaxing base to see the surrounding countryside 
5 mins later the mini bus was there - keep some coins ) on the way back 
while it had a separate small bathroom 
for pleasure or just stopping over on a long flight you cannot go wrong with the gh 
we 've been offered a spacious suite 
i was impressed when i called the front desk to make a request 
big bathrooms 
location was superb - very close to grand place and near lovely shops and cafes 
the gym is disappointing as it is located in a basement and therefore with no windows 
front door at lobby is always locked and security checking gate is in place 
the beds were comfortable and rooms were clean 
in the heart of the city is also the tallest building 
it is also very close to the subway station beurse 
the restaurant breakfast is also just middle of the road 
very very very centralwalking distance to the palace main station and old townwent from amsterdam by train 
the intercontinental is the tallest building in town 
towels are good 
the impressive club lounge was worth the extra cost ( you can pay to upgrade your booking when you arrive 
although the wine prices were quite high 
room was fine and the bathroom very spacious 
nice and clean overall 
this promotion applies to all hotels of same far east hospitality group which the deal is good 
the central square in brussels 
a very nice eek and an excellent value 
the meals were good 
village albert court singapore should discount guest due to their cheap & inferior room products 
the hotel bar is a big disappointment 
and a small fridge 
there was a tub along with shower and the toto toilet with its washlet like bidet and 
tiny but great location 
but the conference lunch and dinner was disappointing 
because we had a gluten free requirement 
very tame red light area and cheap lawsons store below 
pool and common areas are lovely 
not a major street 
10th trip to tokyo and the first time in this area ( kabukicho ) 
convenient for a shopping fun which you can always put your shoping bags back to the hotel and 
excellent location and decent experience 
for our first visit to bali 
free chocolate in the lobby welcome by the kids 
this hotel is grand in parts 
the frontend and entrance to the hotel is just concrete and dull 
it covers a large area and the room is spacial too 
i arrived from a long international flight and needed a blackout room where there was no light so i could 
also some of the public spaces are oddly designed 
the bed and linens very comfortable 
staying here the second time but the service and food have really upped their quality in food and 
great pool and the breakfast buffet is to die for 
hotel does offer free shuttle service to dubai mall 
it seemed to be a good accommodations option 
there are many small shops in the hotel 
they were nice and offered us the lower price as we had stayed there a few days before 
the pool is large and well designed 
this brand is known for its opulence and extravagance but that was a miss everywhere ( maybe cos 
a nice desk with fast wifi and a safe large enough for a laptop 
private beach with surfing available 
and should mention its superb beachside location 
it 's walking distance to the main street and historic sites 
good poolarea with free water and sunlotion and a pool big enough to swim and very quiet 
and no noise from the town even as we left the large balcony door open 
the room was decorated in old hawaiian style and very clean 
a full bath 
on the front desk 
but good value 30 set menu 
dark shower 
do it in advance as their spa is very popular - and we did not manage to book any 
the gardens with the live flamingos are pretty to walk in and the pool area is nice as well 
this is the first time for us in ubud so really ca n't tell how this hotel compares 
one very small quibble is that the internet access is from a computer in the small library above the 
a bit far from the town centre but this adds to the peace and quiet . 
customer service was lacking big time 
so i stayed here the first time back in about 1987 
what 's not so good is the interior decor 
the sun rises about 530 hrs and i spend a lot of time just sitting at the top balcony and 
the attentive and high quality service remains consistent and the rooms get better and better 
big tip get a room facing the acropolis as the front rooms can be a bit noisy 
coffee was available free in the lobby for those who want to trudge downstairs 
the large balcony was great for sitting out and looking at the acropolis 
the room was otherwise fine 
these were not very expensive items 
good strip position 
the single lift is slow but that 's a fair compromise for this great little hotel 
finally the general manager cleared the minor expense of the boat taxi on a 'one time offer only 
she 's a real gem and should be commended for her awesome customer service 
luxury and personal service for the reduced price 
it s true island is bigwith a nice ambiancelot of trees 
there were three couples by the main pool when we were there 
a beautiful relaxing resort 
beautiful hotel excellent service 
this amazing place has truly beautiful and elegance lanna style architecture 
stayed here for four nights in early april 
higher floors get you less city noise 
the spa is also super nice 
the suite is over sized with a huge terrace upstairs and downstairs 
spacious and having all the amenities you would expect from a four seasons 
it 's located away from the city but transport is easy 
always with a personalized check in and they understand the kids needs 
the lanna kids club is one of the best that we have seen so far 
although the furniture are somewhat worn down with use 
very helpful staff 
this hotel is an outstanding choice and compares with everything a couple could ask for in a resort getaway 
tiny pool 
i agree with everything written by the three most recent reviewers 
the rooms are quiet and very comfortable with all the amenities you expect for such a place 
the lunch was very nice and the location overlooking the pool 
the hallways felt old as i was approaching my room - the room itself did n't feel particularly 
when you get past the public area 
ask front desk to keep you away from that side 
our bedroom itself was large with a separate seating area and is functional though dated in styling 
there are numerous shops and restaurants within a five minute walk from the hotel 
as you would expect a fantastically stocked wine cellar adjacent to the bar is very impressive 
the pool was small but very opulent and also had a button which you could press to get a 
but in general gym is ok ( big enough with a lot of equipment 
a most beautiful building full of charm and history were excellence should be the norm rather than the exception 
it does not matter as the location and helpful staffs more than made up for it 
well worth visiting 
the common parts are really nice and it is clearly a disappointment when you enter the room 
it is in easy walking distance to the tram stop 
the gym is adequate for a hotel gym and is accessible 24 hours with the room key 
just next to the taipei main train station and with a subway entrance just next to the hotel 
nice aroma and great buffet breakfast 
there has been some refurbishment and there is still some work going on 
small very good pool area 
the hotel has a gorgeous french country house restaurant at the top 
this mercure was well located only a short walk from the awm 
highly recommended to anyone visiting bangkok as you wo n't be disappointed 
front desk was very helpful with my requests and saw to my needs holistically 
a true 5 stars hotel indeed 
in an area full of embassies and very lush and scenic 
the rooftop bar is a nice feature and good to have a drink late afternoon and enjoy the sunset 
my room has 2 twin beds and the bathroom wall is a 2-piece corner glass 
with shower and deep bathtub and complimentary toiletries 
which had an excellent variety of food and beverage options available 
the mini bar was priced at such an excessive rate that i refused to purchase water even when i was 
the two main restaurants serve wonderful food from an enormous breakfast array in one to fine dining at l' 
the pool area is tiny ( although the rest of the rear garden area is pleasant ) 
the fire pit by the pool is also a comforting touch 
good location and incredibly comfy beds 
booked the wrong hotel 
is thewynn with3 typically pricey lv restaurants-typically 100 pp that are quite good and 
the sofitel sukhumvit is in a great neighborhood to do that in 
a quick change of channel seemed to always bring it back ( room 22517 ) . 
this hgv property has an amazing pool area 
for sightseeing there is a travel agency just in house which arrange private tours in and arround bang 
the show rates for the two hotels were identical but there 's no way i would take the mar 
ok for a quick lunch 
the room was larger 
location was far from the center of the strip - up near circus circus . 
i found the front desk staff to be extremely unhelpful 
commandable richa and vishaka from front desk 
this 5-star hotel feels like paradise after journeying through the slums and dirt roads in 
the quiet room is bare minimum 
the breakfst foyer is one of the most beautiful i have ever seen 
luxurious hotel at the airport 
the bell boy took an excessively long time to come pick up the luggage and then an equally excessive amount 
proximity to airport hard to beat 
while the hotel is very convenient for access to the international airport 
the rooms and the suites are simply superb 
the hotel is next door to the international airport and is full of good eating options 
pillows thin and only two per bed 
the wifi is slow 
quiet hotel 
hotel has a nice swimming pool and guards take care very well if you are with the kids 
but it is a large property and very kid friendly ( i 
it appears they wait until the hotels fall apart and then renovate all 
a good business hotel and i will come back if i am conducting business within the vicinity 
all the public areas in the hotel are spotlessly clean and very well maintained however be aware that prices 
signature restaurants like peshawari 
the whole resort inside and out needs a renovation 
reasonably close to the airport ( approx 
we found the bed a bit firm 
decent bar open till 2am 
the front desk staff can speak english sufficiently well to answer your questions and handle your business if you do 
we did have dinner in the teatro restaurant one evening and we impressed with the ambience 
but i did n't get the goldfish-bowl ground floor caf eatery and the unsec 
but need to wait for at least 1 2 hour for foods to be served as kitchen is at ground 
nice rooms with very high ceilings in a central location ( 5 min walk from raffles and a short 
i particularly liked the nice bath tub 
room is modern with all facilities 
bright public areas 
the bed heavenly 
you can find a better hotel ( at the same price ) in singapore 
tasty and service by the wait staff 
also bar at lobby is vey nice with daily happy hours 
free use of mobile with internet access 
needed to change rooms due to construction noise from property next door 
the breakfast buffet was excellent and again 
room is big enough and bed is comfortable 
great value 
an old property that has seen better days 
also close to central train station and the free cbd bus stop 
room service good 
if that 's the area you are looking for 
breakfast was complementary and had a good spread 
the front desk staff was very welcoming - the champagne is a very nice touch 
the staff are charming and helpful and the breakfast was delicious 
absolutely perfect property in the center of the city 
have their own in room pool and a wonderful round wooden bath top 
i recommend this property . 
one to get to reception and the other to get to your room 
one negative , the hot water in the in-room pool did not work . 
given its prime location on paseo de la reforma 
i did wait up one night up to 10 pm and gave up 
booked a really decently priced package with american airlines and chose this hotel because i had not 
with very little options 
it 's the perfect size for little kids 
the staff were all very pleasant and bow to you every time you walked past 
no general manager 
it is truly an exceptionally elegant hotel 
there is a small bar and dining room and the one dinner we ate there was delicious 
there are too many special little touches to name 
we cannot say more about this incredible hotel 
my understanding that all of the ceilings are original to the property 
we have been to paris many times and hotels in this wonderfull city many times are less than 
the hotel is sharp and fashionable and the staff helpful 
the sauna steam areas are beautiful in mosaic tiles 
nice gym in hotel no large but well equipped 
the foyer is small with four ( mostly unattended ) desks 
the double bed was comfortable but i had not expected to find two single mattresses pushed together 
i was in a single room which i rather liked with its simple but tasteful decor and an excellent 
an assortment of tea is provided and you can order room service from the 2-michelin starred 
but furnished by uncomfortable chairs 
we had only one dinner at the garden restaurant there 
but otherwise nothing else is impressive and the room is slightly outdated 
location three minutes from an underground station is a bonus ( as is the fact that it 's own 
whilst i have no issues with pet friendly hotels 
spa and location were fantastic 
i booked the junior suite deluxe at 1 
the exterior of the building is iconic with a floating bridge between two buildings that houses a swimming pool long 
comfortable business hotel 
the decor was modern and tastefully appointed 
and the club lounge is outstanding . 
the location is convenient for shopping & eating 
the in hotel restaurants and gym were also great 
they have a spacious lobby cafe that is quiet and good for business discussions 
we found the hotel to be very pricey 
room slightly on the small side but still fit two people fairly well . 
lobby area and bar have a great feel but the bar is hotel prices and there is no happy 
breakfast was disappointing - i mean even the chinese cuisine selection was not up to standard 
parking cost 25rooms were spacious and the king size bed very comfortable 
well located and a very good breakfast selection 
ideal for the central railway station too and seems popular with airline crews which must say something 
once the staff even helped pack my suitcases as i was late to airport and had done too much 
a little bit out of the main cbd area 
internet is free 
airport stay not my first choice of airport hotel but it was fine the hotel staff were great my 
the staff are pleasant and it is everything you would expect from a second tier hotel 
after i insisted that i never received a hotel voucher for this pre-paid booking 
the free wireless is provided by a company that serves more than one hotel 
not what i expected mould in the bathroom service in the bar appalling very unfriendly did not like 
but its hard to find cheap parking nearby in this neighborhood 
good luck to you as it would costs you more than a 100 bucks to take a taxi back to 
very good airport hotel 
shower in the bath set up but the excellent water pressure and rainfall shower head was great 
note that this is a different hotel from the holiday inn express lax 
i greatly appreciated this 
and some foods were clearly leftovers from the restaurants on premise 
welcoming at the reception was good and quick checkin with a a awesome surprise by upgrading us 
the room i had was actually a suite with separate bedroom 
and a great place to stay in any capital city 
so after our horrendous night at a small hotel in rome 
this hotel competes directly on price 
service attitude of staff members is excellent 
the hotel is relaxing 
staff did not really get the problem but at the end they manually opened the window for us 
the inroom check in is always a pleasure 
food and drinks were excellent 
the room size are arguably the largest i have seen in the 5 star rated property . 
they looks quite busy with big conference during my stay 
the gym is one of the best maintained that i have seen with cardio 
the juice bar next to the gym and pool is a very relaxing area for reading 
everyone working at the hotel seem to be new recruits . 
one of the best hotel to stay in hanoi 
my room had algae bathroom complete with a free standing bath and a large shower 
access to the executive lounge from this floor was possible 
one of the best i have stayed in 
recently had the opportunity to stay at this amazing hotel 
they are quality as you would find in a good 4 star hotel 
its an excellent property right next to the mumbai international airport 
also one glaring omission is lack of sofas in the reception for one to wait 
good service and reasonable rooms 
conveniently close to the airport 
being a short walk from the museuminsel 
we would often get back to he hotel of an evening and all we wanted was to sit down with 
very close to the museum island- nice breakfast buffet- comfortable rooms bed- very nice room amenitiescont 
the sauna is small and not the most beautiful but this was a minor concern 
you can buy train tickets from the airport directly to friedrichstrasse which is called the abc 
close to shops 
we particularly asked for a quiet room so we were given a room overlooking a courtyard which was very quiet 
what was surprising however was the size and completeness of the fitness centre 
we stayed at the melia berlin for 5 nights in early may 2013 
the concierge was very helpful 
although people in the front desk were not warm and welcoming 
hotel offers a rather expensive airport transfer service 
11 for a glass of wine and 7 for a beer ( depending on the exchange rate ) but the 
extra marks for uselessness and grumpiness go to the front desk 
the beds are comfortable and the choice for breakfast is quite large and overall 
prices are very reasonable and the breakfast is average 
it also recently added free wireless access in all rooms 
old but convenient hotel the hotel rooms are old and not as well kept as it should be as a 
you can actually walk through the subway to next to the hotel 
it clean and the toilet is large enough 
only thing i think they can improve on is to communicate that they will open the gym if you request 
the club lounge is nice and well staffed 
and they serve a complimentary afternoon tea every day which is a really lovely touch and will stave off 
as well as a good gym 
it was freshly made and high quality breakfast and excellent start of the day 
also i 'd recommend the blue duckling an amazing beautifully decorated restaurant 
thanks to her we had an amazing food experience in ipoh 
and that the floor in the shower is a little too smooth for my liking so elderly guests need to 
lack of natural light ( due to being located on the second floor and having only two small windows 
the hotel was very convenient to the airport and had a free shuttle bus 
boring airport hotel 
to live up to the resort name need one or two restaurants and more facilities 
the swimming pool is small and unguarded but has adequate towels but less than adequate seating 
the room in which i stayed was small 
position of the hotel is excellent 
central hotel with good facilities 
tea on turndown service was nice touch 
a lovely pool and a great hamman to steam out the aches and pains 
close to all major sights and excellent transport all around including a taxi stand directly outside the hotel 
only clean rooms at that time that guests have checked out from or having breakfast in the hotel 
unfortunately i stayed in older room but i believe the hotel is busy renovating 
& near charming shops & restaurants 
and the newer areas of warsaw 
please choose a room between 3rd and 5th floor if you want the aquarium facing rooms 
huge king size bed 
good business hotel 
with my laundry being dropped off in the late afternoon of the morning in which it had been collectedthe 
the front desk staff were not helpful 
opening the curtains and instead of having a typical city view you have this magnificent sight of hundreds of fish 
breakfast buffet whilst adequate is certainly not outstanding and they could consider delivering a newspaper to the room 
a good gym 
the location is quite nice though it 's not in the city centre but i think it 's 
its worth a visit to sit in the lobby and have a drink or meal and watch the fish 
there is a underground car park however it is not free for guests 
what an expensive price to pay for a window 
the lobby of this hotel is arguably one of the more impressive ones ( at least in europe ) 
breakfast good but served outside in courtyard - enjoyable if in vacation clothes 
there was a kind of communal kitchen across the courtyard where you could make coffee or tea and help yourself 
very tasteful decor 
the decor is a little over the top but not unpleasant 
the bed was comfortable and the shower hot and strong 
chinatown colonial boutique chic 
fast and friendly check in 
thought the bedding was comfortable 
all the staff were delightful and we had a great stay 
i had a good 2 nights' rest at le marais which is away from the noise on bourbon 
the hotel is in the center of the french quarter and that is its biggest quality 
across the street is a starbucks and trader joes 
great location close to n michigan shops and lots of restaurants close by 
bathrooms a bit small but very efficient and love the full gigantic bottles on wall of bath products 
great location next to dulles international 
poor service at every point 
super great amenities and what an awesome pool 
pre-buy a parking pass at the parking structure adjacent to the hotel 
the bed was super comfy and i slept well 
very good value given that it is so convenient and clean 
the beach is also about 7 min walk 
the bathroom is big enough 
the hotel room is large but smells a bit smokey and the decor is looking dated 
location is also 
the hotel is located very close to the pearl tower and the acquarium 
my room is upgraded executive type with nice sleeping area 
the staff is always very helpful 
public areas are luxuriously appointed 
the room rate was very faire and i will come back for sure 
great city 
service was very good and rooms were nice as spacious 
not usually a fan of hotel breakfasts but even the buffet here is great 
same for the cheese and they pretend to offer fresh juices but the orange one was definitively not a real 
internet reliable and fast 
the morning breakfast was very nice with a buffet that would cover nearly everyone 's tastes and dietary requirements 
drinks in bar very expensive 
the rooms are great 
the fairmont gold lounge is a beautiful space to sit back and enjoy the action on the water below 
all the staff were very helpful 
hotel complimentary limousine service a nice touch 
it ranks right up there with all the other super nice hotel spas we are finding more often & 
a nice calm beach 
with great conference & meeting facilities as well as a lovely pool area 
no chance of lying quietly and relaxing 
luxurious decor 
the lodge is ten minutes away from the small town of jasper but it offers everything you 'd 
he was fussed over by both the concierge and another front office staff 
pantry off the main dining room had a microwave and full-size refrigerator 
this resort is set in beautiful scenery 
the pool was being maintained and no-one seemed to know how to turn on the jets in the 
the room was spacious 
which is one of the better options in vik 
the accommodation is lodge style with four units block and there was very little noise leakage from other rooms and 
the property is beautiful and the hotel is made up of several buildings 
room beautifully clean with all amenities- love your coffee machines and such a comfortable stay 
so the evenings we spent drinking the complimentary wine from the management in front of a open fire 
moose 's nook serves delicious regional cuisine 
town offers some good coffee shops 
nicely furnished hotel with fantastic restaurants and good meeting facilities and well equipped gym 
it did n't feel super luxury or super polished but it 's high-end enough with good 
the choice of restaurants is amazing the hotel offer buffet style for all the restaurant japanese 
he claimed he saw it and understood it and then apologised but proferred his tray of nice nibbles 
great service and decent arrangement 
they took the time to send a nice note but did not put any towels in the room 
unless you have free breakfast as part of the package 
its a short walk ( but lot of traffic 
i was ushered into the private reservation office and offered a cold beverage and hot towel 
it was not durian or any fruit with strong smell color at all 
beautiful facilities 
bathroom was good with bathtub and full toiletries provided 
amazing bed 
there is a great gym on site and a nice pool for those down time moments 
a simple bathroom with both a tub and shower was good 
massive ( and empty ) gym 
spacious and very clean with a large private balcony 
they have try their best to save the beautiful beach now it just look like a manmade beach with 
good menu selection at reasonable prices 
good rates and big size rooms 
even at check out one of the managers gave me a gift which i have on display at my house 
on the best shopping spot in bruxelles right in the avenue louise 
the front desk transfers me to local reservation for last 10 times no one has picked up 
) the lobby and the area 's terrace are nice 
to make matters worse the next four guests were shown to the adjacent table 
so there was free parking in front of the hotel 
but given the large proliferation of very good local restaurants eating in a hotel seems unnecessary 
this is a greatly maintained property ( tasi section ) and has the easiest parking access among all the 
turned out to be a great trip 
i just missed snacks and happy hour at the exec lounge ( bummer ) so headed down to my 
busy resort hotel 
needs to have a major overhaul if it were to compete with the much luxurious hotels elsewhere 
not busy with people and while you have to wade across broken coral you are soon in a live 
the bathroom was nice 
scuffed bathroom door and peeling wallpaper - not great 
i 've stayed at luxor many times as well as many other ones on the strip - mainly 
but an amazing place to stay 
milk and juice available 
i 've stayed here at the luxor on more than one vacation 
at first i thought something was outside by the window 
my room was noisy from the kitchen activity and had a few things not working 
perfectly located in the city centre 
probably one of the unique hotel in the world 
good staff attitude 
it was cheap even with the resort fee and less than i paid a dozen years ago during my first 
the suite was very nice but not very functional 
housekeeping dropped the ball few times ( found things from previous visitors found in my room ) 
the room was clean 
the best shops ( caesar 's and the fashion mall ) are close to the bellagio 
one of the rooms had twin beds and the other was basically a single room ( there was only one 
loved the 5 table minimums at some of the tables at excalibur 
se stayed for three nights in the 2-bedroom pool villa and the stay was amazing 
just outside the hotel are some very good and inexpensive restaurants 
one of the best hotels i 've ever stayed in 
i think it still needs more to stay competitive with the super high end 
be prepared for challenges in the parking garage - spaces are hard to come by 
excellent service and facilities - pool amazing 
seven nights of a very good vacation 
there are very few hotels with direct access to waikiki beach what comes at steep premium 
the air conditioner is controlled by a movement sensor so you wake up and the room is hot because 
check in is at three and my room was n't ready until 4 
closer to the main building ( restaurants and pool ) 
we booked all the tours via the tour booking desk and there was no trouble at all 
luzern is a lovely town 
none of the warm thai hospitality that i 'm used to in resort towns 
the beach is good and not too busy 
and i thought i would not find a better resort in krabi 
rollaway beds are available 
hire van from the hotel to visit the nice surroundings ( elephants 
location great for the metro and several good bars ( including an excellent craft beer place ) nearby 
we had a very good nights sleep 
the only thing i did n't like was the check-in 
comfortable bed ( altho a bit hard ) 
- human scale with personalized service - i joined their vip club which among other things enables access to 
bigger hotels are not necessarily better 
although this particular one is about 15 mins stroll from the main activity area at the v 
the setting is nice 
we liked the view and the large room 
it really should have a children free area for those wanting to relax 
there were plenty of choices and enough stuff to make sure tables were being cleaned right away 
club lounge was good always 
the bathroom is very large 
layered smaller pools separated by seating areas 
the check in was pleasant and the concierge was knowlegeable 
completely detached from the main lounge and we had to cross two rooms to enter the buffet area 
pools are nice 
this was a bit crowdy . 
the room was beautifully decorated 
hotel is nicely located in cotai area 
beautiful property , interesting design , clever architecture and the lush green surroundings are a nice change . 
you can call taxi by phone or apps ( blue bird ) to the hotel to transport you around band 
this time i brought my little family to have quick short getaway 
the staffs were quite friendly i 
i was given a late checkout til 4pm with my gold status 
public transport in close proximity although hotel also provides shuttle service to certain places of interest in dubai 
the taxi situation ( especially on a hot rainy friday night ) is pretty bad in macau but 
we were offered a better choice of vegetarian options on the buffet and yet 
minimalist decor 
fresh brewed coffee in all floors is a good idea 
seemed very fully priced for the very mediocre offering 
though the conference facilities are spacious and generally good 
there were 17 check in stations open 
the rest of the staffs are friendly and greet you all the time 
lots of small pools with varying depths 
room is of good size and equally elegant 
great staff and an awesome breakfast in an excellent location 
there was a separate shower and bath 
it was my first leg of a week long vacation 
outdoor areas are very well set with numerous pools ( 4th floor ) 
plus free wifi 
although it can be a little difficult finding the right shuttle bus amongst the 20 or so buses waiting 
really the only thing going for the resort is the miles of palm lined white sandy beaches and the clear 
the beach is very wide and long and white 
i can say that the beach front here at the bohol beach club is by far superior to 
bohol beach club is one of panglao island 's first resort of its kind 
its main virtue is that it is in the centre of the city almost directly above wynyard station 
good value simple accommodation in central sydney 
service at reception is awful and depressing 
it got even more interesting when the reception clerk looked up at me 
the bathroom has a separate shower and bath which is rare for a hote 
it is also a good walk to circular quay 
i told him i was spg and he actually asked me you are spg with a very disbel 
for the price this is great value 
the hotel is in the strategic location 
equally spacious bathroom with shower and separate tub 
more surprises awaits my family the moment we opened our doors as birthday cake and anniversary greetings were smart 
outside noise not too bad after midnight with window closed 
rooms with a view cost s 15 extra 
they mostly have free shuttle to take you almost anywhere in macau 
if u are here for gambling the casino is right below and open 24 hrs 
because the hotel is a part of casino complex you should be ready to such sleepless nights with drunken 
but the food and service was very ordinary 
there 's a separate cubicle for the shower & toilet 
the bathroom was perfect clean and the shower power was excellent 
would definitely stay here again for business 
the subway ( clarke quay station ) is also very close 
pool facing rooms are best 
air conditioning efficient and i liked the window seat 
but the wash area very cramped 
the breakfast buffet in the main dining room is also excellent 
it was n't available because somebody checked out late and they had n't cleaned it yet 
security is also top notch at the hotel so you feel very well protected 
bed and furniture in good condition 
great view on a higher floor 
there are plenty of restaurants in the area so we did not have the opportunity to try any of the 
it has a good view of hcm city and is nice and quiet 
the rooms are very large and overall it was pretty quiet despite being located right in the middle of downtown 
with nice bathrooms 
we had a suite in towers and that was worth every penny we stayed in the towers and had 
we had a lovely suite and enjoyed the place a lot 
good pool though small in size 
coffee not brilliant but that is easily rectified by a walk across the road to trung n 
breakfast was tasty with a good spread at the buffet 
-nice workout room 
this ridiculous scam at hotels has to be resisted 
the room was ok but only had two bath towels so if you came in from the heat outside more 
and even though the hotel is in a very built-up area it did feel relaxing and peaceful 
this hotel does have super small bathrooms 
- hidden behind the drapes is a power bar 
right on the center of hcm with easy walking distance to many of the attractions and happenings 
lunch everyday was a buffet in the same room as breakfast which had lots of options and international choices 
a parking garage is opposite the hotel which saves cost on the expensive valet parking of the hotel 
but outrageously priced 
the sheraton is very central an excellent location and rooms are very nice 
unfortunately this did n't give me an opportunity to try & request a similar room as previous & 
steam and outdoor hot tub 
better room size 
the amenities it offered and the general feel of the place 
the hotel itself is a bit old but it is sheraton after all plus very few real 5- 
we were greeted by friendly and accomodating staff 
they have several excellent restaurants on site 
a really well run and maintained hotel 
which i considered of not being so good value 
try a lower floor for a speedier exit to your airport shuttle 
223 is daylight robbery for such a low standard and tired property 
the bistro dinner was quite good 
the front desk staff seemed a bit aloof 
good hotel at the airport 
but the bed is one of the best i 've ever had in any hotel in the world 
great soft comfy bed though 
but you have to pay aud6 each way - i think an airport hotel should have a free shuttle 
i got a very good price and at reception we were given an upgrade even though the room was pre 
what you have on offer in the bar and what you sold in the lounge were from two very 
they then moved him again to a room with a walk in shower which is great but please tell me 
and the front desk made it clear the shuttle service has been outsourced 
the better amenities 
my marriott rewards request were honored and i was given a high-floor room with extra towels and 
make sure you ask for a higher floor 
you get fantastic accommodation and facilities 
on one side there was a desk area and the other side has a nice sitting area and the mini 
the infiniti pool at your suite is beautiful 
the room is spacious 
do n't forget to ask reception for the key to the clock tower on the 6th floor for 
watch movies and just chill make for a vacation where you will most likely not see anyone during your time 
but it got very stuffy in there and we needed to keep the windows open 
along with cold and hot dishes 
the only saving graces are a large flatscreen tv 
the stairs seemed somewhat awkward and thought the pool would be better positioned at ground level 
the ships coming into the harbour and the fishing boats making their innumerable trips 
free wifi with good reception 
the reception and lounge very pleasant 
got suite on second floor which was the old non renovated rooms 
close to restaurants and cafes 
it is a small property with two wings 
after a long flight with a 5 hour delay in asia 
room 410 ( or any other corner room ) is a good choice 
would i go back to the sofitel on my next visit to budapest 
everyone was extremely nice from the doormen to housekeeping 
he really helped us to arrange a nice restaurant 
as one of the best hotels in budapest 
the menu of spa services looked great 
choices of restaurants were plenty and the staff at the reception are happy to help in giving directions 
so it is within easy walking distance to sol but a little more buffered from a sometimes rowdy 
fitness and the enthusiasm 
average decor and breakfast 
breakfast was also a great spread with some healthy options which are usually rare in hotel breakfasts 
if i was only in airport 6hrs or less i 'd just use the spa the next 
i thought about just wandering and hanging out in the terminals but eventually decided to bite the bullet and shell 
however stay here again if i was visiting the area and the price was right 
the free breakfast buffet is very good 
poerfuls shower and good size suite and bathroom 
i specifically remembered the front desk state i had free breakfast and crossed out the 12 
you also have free coffee and tea 
this was an unwelcome waste of time after a long flight and could easily be improved 
the bathroom was bigger than i expected and it had a large bath tub in it with shower facilities 
the hotel could n't be better situated - only a short walk to milan central station and the 
what a great place to stay in milan when needing a hotel close to railway station but with easy 
very large rooms and clean 
coupled with the sheet thing 
i was told that that was not the case but that there had been instances of bags being stolen from 
our room which was deluxe on the 10th floor was great 
the bathroom was spacious 
nice gym with all you need for a good workout 
free internet access is available and daily buffet breakfast is first rate 
as city hotels go the size was pretty good i have been in a lot worse for more money 
everything you need plus a free mini bar and rubber duck 
the complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the room 
ultra comfortable huge bed and a good sized lounge area and big screen tv 
free mini bar but no alcohol 
close to shopping and just so handy to everything one needs in a hotel and city 
the bed was great 
the complimentary softdrink bar was also unique 
they do provide complementary minibar 
restaurants and an easy walk to the ferry 
the king sized bed was very comfortable 
one with alcohol beverage package ( adults only ) and the cheaper version of 160 with soft drinks 
breakfast buffet ( do n't like buffets ) is better than most as is the lunch buffet 
the use of the sister hotel and the free boat ridethe location everything within 10 min walkthere were 
oh i am short of words to describe this hotel it 's probably the best and the most romantic 
get a lounge above the pool area and spend the day there with an hour for a relaxing lunch in 
take my advice and walk out of the hotel turn right and there are loads of great cafes that will 
you 'd better stay in this hotel only one or two nights to enjoy taormina and the 
terrible beds 
the hotel neighborhood is safe and busy but it has no shops conveniently located nearby and no eating options except 
the area was not busy 
warm and welcomingthe room is not big but good enough for the european standardwe had breakfast 
bathroom was excellent 
the service is very good 
the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed i have ever had 
the view from the deck blew us away . 
the executive lounge is the largest i have ever been in and the breakfast there is very good 
it is very close to where one would get the sapsan train to st petersburg and 
higher floors obviously offer better views 
even though this is a modest hotel it is the best in the village 
nagarkot town ( a large village really ) is a 2 minute stroll away 
there is a good on site laundry which we used to catch up with some washing and drying 
a small kitchenette complete with fridge 
executive lounge has great happy hour selections 
steam room and sauna were of high quality with consistent temp 
the complimentary 2 bottles of water in the fridge was nice touch 
gym is an apology 
like most marriott hotels this one is very very good 
with a proper bathroom and good toiletries 
stayed here for business for 3 nights and used the restaurants and concierge lounge quite a bit 
surprisingly quiet for a central city hotel 
good business hotel and well located in sheffield 
cold bare rooms 
there are plenty of good food options 
it is probably one of the biggest lounge area i have ever seen and has a spectacular view of downtown 
separate bath ans shower 
the pool was clean and supervised 
try to avoid the 3rd floor unless you like keep fit 
some minor negatives 
it is impossible to get more central than this if you want to be in the old city 
good rooms 
if the drains in our bathroom had a bad smell 
long check-in queues 
generally good boutique hotel 
yet it costs the same as the other non hotel spas ( which are never as nice as this 
late checkout not problem 
nice city view ( pudong skyline ) and huge executive lounge with good selection 
lobby bar was my regular hangout to either meet visiting friends or colleagues or just relax by myself 
people square is just a block away too and the subway links to most places in shanghai 
the service was outstandingthe food we ate in the restaurant was probably one of the best in the city 
we arrived at siem riep airport and had a little wait for the hotel pickup service to 
the staffs there are all so pleasant and willing to take extra steps to keep the guests happy 
still a good place to stay in shanghai 
lovely little pool and decent restaurant and 2 ) a training centre for disadvantaged local youths who are given 
it is in a very convenient downtown location and easy to get around shanghai from here 
the entire property had free wifi and the room showers were clean 
cold fragrant towels each time you step foot back at the hotel 
there is still some building work ongoing next door but this did not disturb us in any way 
though not a major street 
there is also an a la carte menu to choose some local dishes or western eggs made every which 
the shinta mani club is a modern and comfortable boutique hotel that can be an oasis 
the quality of the breakfast was first class and all the staff we came into contact with were extremely helpful 
we rode to the palace and shopping streets of marunouchi and the kids really enjoyed dodging people 
ask for a room on the ground floor overlooking the pool as you get a small terrace 
complimentary water and free mini bar with soft drinks and beer 
convenient controls for automatic curtains and shades but no reason to open them with nothing but buildings across it 
for the price not worth it 
the amenities are fabulous - they provide pyjamas 
while this is clearly not a cheap hotel 
wifi is good 
do n't go with a huge luggage cos there will not be any space to put it 
take you to famous sights 
the entrance is back off the street and the reception small and uninspiring but this also helps the 
great little cafe around the corner called riggeiro 
on one of the main streets in central kyoto 
the rest of the property is fantastic and the staff is top notch 
staff and the overall look of the place 
we found the staff a little on the amateur side and quite young and inexperienced but if you are looking 
the pool area has two good pools 
there are a lot of shops and restaurants near by 
the breakfast in the lounge had a very good variety and very good quality of items 
a great half price happy hour every day of the week 
this was the second one we tried ( in the same trip ) and we saw some consistencies 
there was a long spiral staircase that you needed to descend to go to bathroom 
there is a communal lukewarm shallow pool 
there were many tiny bugs coming out from the grapes on the complimentary fruit plate on the desk 
there is also the usual jet ski and other water sports available 
the hotel is right on the square making it a perfect spot to go out for a walk around the 
all in all a solid business hotel 
the club lounge is as basic as it gets - there is no staff on duty 
there is parking underneath the hotel but this is public parking and it was very frustrating last visit that i 
the only thing i would n't recommend is taking up their free meal offer - the meal was not 
we received a shrug and a point to the front desk 
the gardens are well kept and attractive and the swimming pool large 
the offer of a complimentary drink in the lounge ( thank you omar 
it is authentic and clean and the staff was very nice 
this was a highly enjoyable - even relaxing - stay at the sirkeci konak 
the standard rooms are of adequate size but hardly commodious 
very elegant and superior quality decor 
and can we have a stronger wifi signal near the entrance 
and a small buffet for breakfast 
i have stayed at this property numerous times but was so disappointed when i visited in early may 
the bathrooms was great since it had a standing shower and a separate bathtub 
this may have been my first visit to the park hyatt chicago but it certainly wo n't 
on check in asked if i would be upgraded as i had a virtuoso booking and was told 
the work table is large and well organized and position you can watch tv at the same time 
a beautiful room in the renovated section 
but twice we had to phone for the third towel which seemed to go missing 
nice modern chick hotel 
the building itself looks like a typical ugly 80ies concrete thing but inside it is ok 
our stay started in a positive war with helpful and friendly reception staff and concierge services 
fine because you can find wifi elsewhere in queenstown 
the room is on the top floor with a balcony directly facing the lake 
zagreb will be a major city in central europe and zagreb westin is a 
great location 
breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and very good quality 
there were a number of coach parties booked in but the hotel is large enough to cope with this without 
restaurant and bar are good ( fare and prices typical of novatel brand ) 
they have a deal with a garage closeby that you prepay 15 to get a ticket from the 
clean air but our room was on street side and morning trucks and buses were too loud 
the bathroom was huge with very nice decor 
also there was free internet access in the lobby 
though not sure what the upgrade actually got us 
the common areas of the hotel are nice ( though not exceptional ) and the room are spacious ( though 
a toned down decor and some great restaurants 
fantastic pool and a wonderful bar area 
the room on the 58th floor was incredible with a sitting area separated from the bedroom by a partition 
the hotel is linked to the wynn hotel and both hotels are so huge it 's easy 
nice stay and i think good for this location 
it is also close to lots of fairly good and relatively inexpensive restaurants 
wonderful service and spacious rooms 
the beds are very hard so be sure 
if you want to do the sit at a bar and play video poker and drink for free 
swiping the magnetic strip in your keyboard is kinda 
but food court is wonderfully convenient for snacking 
its always going to be a high floor 
super pool 
great english speaking staff 
the bedroom was a little cramped with a little under 2 feet distance between the tv table and the bed 
the hotel is very extravagant 
we tried all the restaurants and they were good 
also nice bar with traditional chinese music 
both hotels are great 
the wifi is good 
the outside pool was closed 
we stayed on the club floors and the club lounge is excellent with a very nice breakfast

subway station and next to wangfujing pedestrian street 
i recently dined at the grand hyatt 's signature restaurant made in china for lunch and 
there was a shopping mall attached to the hotel with a food court and several restaurants and fast food outlets 
similar price points you can get the jw marriott beijing 
she said room not ready 
but this hotel is amazing 
the breakfast buffet was plentiful and we were glad that it was included in our room rate 
the pool was awesome place for the kids to unwind after a day of sightseeing

nice swimming pool 
i really thought this was a high quality doubletree and would definitely return 
great service and everything perfectly clean 
the swimming pool was indoor 
were not spotless . 
so the interiors combine old world charm with fully modern bathrooms 
just be sensible more or less as you would be in any other big city 
the dining area is huge so if you want to eat away from the large and noisy groups you can 
being vegetarian we had limited food options so we went all out to arrange whatever we desired 
located on the witthayu ( wireless road ) around 30-45 minutes from the airport 
the service has been impeccable and this recent stay 
but we did enjoy ourselves and the food 
stayed here twice in may and most recently in early july 
spacious modern room 
located in the heart of charlestons historic district 
great style and nice pool cafe too 
all the staff went above and beyond to make our visit comfortable and pleasant 
9 hole par 3 course is great and restaurants are good 
the 30 barely covers lunch here for one person --- it 's not about the money 
the lobby is tired and there 's nothing particularly exciting or luxurious about the hotel - especially when compared 
the resort has a fantastic location on a rocky outcrop overlooking the pacific ocean 
skytrain is a 5 minute walk away and it is near the tollway leading to the airport ( 
excellent location walking distance to nightlife and restaurants but off a much quieter side street 
nice menus and fair pricing 
the staffs were great 
the resort is really nice 
it 's close to the airport ( the street crossing is safe but you might just use the free 
in the top floor they is a small swimming pool and an excellent bar where one can seat outside and 
all in all a wonderful place to stay 
canapes were good quality 
other than minor noise during their fire alarm testing one afternoon 
the hotel staff was great and sent a shuttle for me- check in was quick and friendly 
there is a risk that some non-guest can easily enter the lift and proceed all the way

this is a basic business hotel 
clean and spacious rooms 
it was one of the quietest hotels i 've stayed in

the food at the restaurant was really good too 
the reception and public areas were newly refurbished and very smart 
the staff are all young and hip and the d cor is vibrant and busy 
feel very relaxing when you need to get away from crowded city 
the bathroom had a good shower 
the bathroom was well appointed and the toiletries were l'occintane and had a lovely fragrance 
the bathroom was a good size with a large walk in shower 
the items in the mini bar absolutely funky to the point of hilarious ( inflatable beach ball 
the italian and international restaurants at the hotel are great and we had many fine dinners in them with 
although there were signs of wear and tear - the odd carpet stain and paint that had rubbed off the 
first real positive is direct access to the beach 
the pool was nicer ( and quieter ) and they seemed to just have more space in general 
but during the day it is a 15 - 20 minute walk to leblon or a short taxi 
the pool is large and there are lots of sun beds 
melia hotels in general are n't the same as they used to be 
the hotel in itself is a nice property with a beautiful pool area that also leads to the beach 
the location is good with lots of great restaurants and cafes close by and the hotel itself is charming 
cool bars 
the lobby area has plenty of space and the restaurants are above average 
this is probably one of the prprettiest ritz not on the ocean that i have 
rooms are very clean with great air conditioning 
from the check-in to the check-out just the best service you could expect 
the price was excellent on the room 
and all the amenities you 'd expect from a hilton 
i also had a number of meals on property and they were all very good 
industrial carpets and tired furniture remind you of that old look hilton is so busily trying to 
the pool is very nice and the breakfast is excellent 
the beds were soft sleeping good quality 
but it had enough space for me 
right next to the unglamorous lobby is the magnificent entrance to the jw marriott 
however , what was missing was a relaxing single sofa . 
they try their best to make guests happy but some guests will never be happy period 
rooms smell good ( not by default in chinese hotels ) and normally have pretty large bright window with 
it was quite simply an appalling request for a 2 hour extension when the resort was not full 
all the rooms are now contemporary and cool with beautiful views of lake geneva and the fountain 
the fixtures had poor grouting and the water pressure for the shower was weak 
but again the weather prevented any further visits 
the betsy would probably get 4 stars if the rooms were 150 dollars cheaper a night but for 350 
look no further if an immaculate , hillside , elegant , true international 5-star hotel 
might look for somewhere a bit more my style better value 
the public areas are very nice 
and a mile high pile of fluffy white towels 
the hotel is full service and well appointed 
good fisherman 's wharf location for tourist related activities and a lot of food options nearby but all 
good hotel 
it has 2 bedrooms- one with king size bed and another one has a queen size bed 
but we were actually very pleasantly surprised and there was lots of choice

you can have a good nights sleep 
room looked very clean and nicely decorated 
the rooms are really nice and the view is quite splendid 
free airport shuttle which you can call on the free phone from the airport 
we had dinner at the resort on one of the evenings 
very convenient to southern cross station ( and skybus to airport ) and very close to ethihad stadium 
reception check in was quick and efficient and the valet parking took car of the car 
i had the buffet one night and the food was absolutely cold 
is old world and very long and wide corridors 
we thought it looked run down and not very good value for money 
reception and restaurant staff were helpful and knowledgeable 
my only issue is the showers as you have to toy around with the hot and cold to get it 
all in all we would recommend amari particularly if you can get a good deal on price 
that the amari brand lost a potentially good customer and those whom he tells 
do be mindful of the stairs if you are not mobile 
it 's not okay to have to walk across the street and use the complimentry wifi in the 
the bathroom was tiny and my salad bowl is bigger than the wash basin 
buffet breakfast is excellent but the rooms are a 3 star standard

big problem is there is not a shop or restaurant anywhere near this property as it is in an industrial

30 minutes from lhr in a nice quiet area 
the on window you could open was only a tilt window and the beds uncomfortable 
on the plus side the beds and breakfast are good but the bar and restaurant are very average in terms 
good size rooms 
clean and a good price 
nice indoor and outdoor hot tubs 
the spa offers were excellent - i 'd go back just for those 
i now have two favourite sydney hotels 
the free wifi worked fine 
there is a very nice workout facility in the hotel that is actually an external fitness club to which hotel 
the food is good 
the rooms are large with reasonably large and very comfortable beds 
the hotel has a nice location by the lake however the restaurant is very expensive and the rooms adequate 
the next day the hotel plumber fixed the ac and turned the radiator off-we were given a 
architectural constraints should not be an issue when you look at similar priced hotels such as the shel 
we had a nice drink in the morse bar which we love 
centrally located grand hotel 
with long queues for service ) 
breakfast service was spotty 
i had several meals at tradewinds 
it is not cheap but very well presented and great quality - so i thought good value for money 
resort is well maintained , beach villa is well appointed , overwater villa with infinity pool 
the second problem area with this resort is the food quality as many others have said before 
not too expensive drinks 
7am or 9am tip 4 free wifi in reception area and free wired internet in every room 
as with all le meridiens 's the shower accessories are plentiful and excellent quality 
they are parked right on the property and the concierge can arrange rides for you 
the upgrade was great and the lounge staff was truly amazing 
the bed gave me a perfect sleep and the sofa in the living room was also quite comfortable 
gym was good sized with all appropriate equipment 
skip the executive lounge for breakfast in favor of the downstairs restaurant ( faster and better service 
the executive lounge is well sized and has a good spread - very satisfactory 
the pool had a great view of the mountains too 
small rooms 
tv double bed 
had we been staying longer 
the pool area is good but you need to be careful on the slippery tiles - the pool was extremely 
i booked one king room for me and one double room for the other couple 
also only having a shower and no bath in a delux room is pretty poor 
the huge buffet breakfast is impressive and the servers and waiters keep things running very smoothly 
the swimming pool is nice 
stay in the main building 
i did enjoy the day bed adjoining the window and we had great views of the nearby mountain 
the hotel has reasonably easy access to most of the attractions one might wish to visit 
they are not adaptable at allfood is ok but no tastydefinitely not kind of hotel i 
the hotel itself was good for amenities and have friendly staff and we 're also very accommodating when i 
big bathroom with a great bath 
get a high floor for a great view over the city 
very nicely decorated and the facilities are outstanding ( the gym is more than adequate and the pool is really 
- well maintained room 
breakfast a good spread but staff appear unhappy 
my only advice is to make sure you get a large room if space is important for you 
the lobby is huge and beautiful-- very modern 
unique , boutique , comfortable , luxurious and fun - the bar in particular was awesome . 
the club facilities were good but not the best we have experienced in respect of the nibbles selection 
the main pool also had used band aids floating in the water 
location is attractive - next to the beach 
the lobby is bright and we had used our certificates to upgrade to a suite room with mountain views 
one staff member in particular took the time to explain some great sightseeing options ( even outside of the 
as you finish skiing you pass through the apres ski lounge with a good log fire type atmosphere 
i can truthfull say that it is on a par with some of the best suites we have been 
fruit and cooked to order hot dishes 
the lobby was beautiful with a simple modern design the place was a walking distance to dubai mall through 
good food 
common areas recently getting an upgrade 
area very nice 
very nice property 
also full of amenities was satisfactory than other accor hotels from europe during june 12-25 
i booked a basic fairmont room with upgrade if available 
the hotel is ideally located and its employees are friendly and professional 
they had a good staff as well 
ushered to a separate check-in reception on the executive floor and shown to my room 
was upgraded to a suite when it became available after first night which is a nice room with spa bath 
gives you quick access to shopping 
food was good and pricing was reasonable 
ritz- carlton delivers again super service 
expensive internet 
it was adequate but not luxury 
what a great hotel experience 
a good class business hotel 
friendly smiles 
a relaxing and peaceful getaway for business travellers 
and i would recommend staying in one of the nicer hotels in the center 
our room ( 611 ) was a good size and bright with a double aspect 
and it went very well all the way - the pool is very different from conventional ones with the slides 
the toilet bowl to the left and the shower area to the right 
rooms are good-- location is good- wifi works well- shower is decent-- breakfast is excellent and 
the bed was very comfortable with all the accessories ( soap 
we checked in after a late arriving flight and were pleased to find the front desk staff very helpful 
and had good amenities and customer service 
the hotel provided free lounge chairs and towels for the beach 
they also had lovely toiletries waiting for the kids on check-in 
its average in its layout , the hotel ambience is average , the only nice thing is that 
unfriendly staff 
the waitors were rather stressed and all in all it was a bad start of the day for both 
there 's also the best mc mall right underneath 
one could walk to the museum square if one feels like it and take in the shops and dining places 
with separate shower and tub 
nothing to complain about really and would come back to this hotel for another short stay in the future 
old city pictures ) and a great bathroom 
it is still alright to stay in this ibis property if you are going to travel on budget 
me wife and 2 children stayed one night in 2 rooms at this hotel before our flight back home 
the lobby is quite cold and the reception is pretty efficient 
the separate bedroom had a wonderfully sumptuous bed 
fluffy towels 
they charge a huge amount for wifi 
cheap parking next door 
this is a great location hotel for shopping and dining 
bars is the key attribute of this hotel and therein lies the clue 
the foyer is very nice too 
30am wake up for an early flight 
it was on the first floor and open in the atrium of the hotel 
which is the high street of d sseldorf with all the nice boutiques and shops 
it 's just stunning and the drinks were both delicious and considerably less expensive than i 'm used 
this metro line is direct to red square and other major tourist areas 
just the bathtub with curtain which does not offer a comfortable showering experience 
there is easy access to the sdcc next door 
the highlight was a big bathroom with a very fancy and modern toilet - akin to those you find in 
) there is a very nice outdoor pool area with towels 
a generously sized pool and good pool side service ( the guacamole 
loads of parking next door at rates which were better than the other hotels we considered 
the hotel offers pretty good value 
it 's a great city hotel for business or for a short trip to helsinki 
its a short walk to the cool cafes 
a nice choice of hot and cold items 
the staff was really friendly 
sleep quality was great 
good staff and service close to everything san diego has to offer to visitors 
i got this hotel because the review said there is a nearby train station going to amsterdam but we 
check in to check out the staff was courteous and professional and the staff at the bar were 
amazing pool overlooking the bay 
it was worth the wait 
the bathroom was fine with a powerful shower and a good range of toiletries 
good hotel with a really fabulous breakfast only 15 mins by shuttle bus from airport 
very friendly reception and check out staff 
but the gentleman was so nice and offered me the full buffet since it was just me and i think 
they charge extra for things that other cp 's thrown in as part of the package 
the parking is quite convenient although a bit on the expensive side ( approx 
as the hotel is the first on the pick up route 
good value 
there is a free shuttle from schiphol airport to the hotel 
( all hotels globally will accommodate early arrivals ) if possible 
room are nicely sized and neat and clean 
the quaint hotel has unusual interior design and offers lots of fun for families 
very likely i will look at other options next time 
stayed here for 4 nights due business 
you can hire bycicles in reception which is a nice touch 
the higher floor rooms are good 
very nice rooms with good decor and in convenient location for the cotai strip 
the golf course and the hotel but vineyards etc close by 
parking valet service is available for approx 
in the minibar there was a bottle of mo t that had been opened by a previous guest 
bathrooms too are of a decent size with decent toiletries and linen 
it is opposite centraal station 
the hotel is very well locate and the interior is beautiful 
the staff were very helpful and interested in you 
the lobby is clean and fairly updated 
room was very clean 
the suite was very spacious with two large bathrooms and plenty of room for the four of us to sit 
the free minibar is a nice perk 
there is a walkway that goes from the hotel to the ala moana shopping centre where you 
it was late and i was tired so i did n't feel like arguing with the gal . 
the location is several blocks from the newer upscale shopping by waikiki beach 
pool area was good 
public space 
the front desk staff is atypically cold not your usual waikiki hotel type of friendly 
and came with a big lounge chair that allowed us to look out towards fifth avenue nypl 
food is great and staff are friendly ( by ny standards ) 
stayed at the sultan hotel as it is near to a tradeshow held at jakarta 
we were given a large room that overlooked the library 
there are many good restaurants in the area 
the bed is very comfortable 
but basic hotel with yr standard amenities 
i was not even lucky to get a hot coffee 
rooms are very modern and spacious 
and you can pick up the din but not too bad if you 're on a high floor 
the hotel entrance is a bit confidential and you have to look twice to see it 
part of it is the standard andaz quality that i come to appreciate ( free snacks 
we really appreciated the tea coffee and complimentary soft drinks and snacks and the free wifi was super fast and 
this is a very simple and reasonable value offer where everything works and it is convenient to the airport 
am currently staying here on a work trip and this property is superb 
and booked this through expedia the price is very good compared to other swiss hotels 
we had a suite which was big 
despite being in a very busy part of town 
front desk staff more flexible and accommodating and good englishgood price 
the gym is equipped with all essential equipment and usually not busy 
i stayed overnight enroute to istanbul and i was pleasantly surprised at how convenient the hotel is 
the bedroom has a king bed with two large side tables 
the executive lounge have a nice spread of food to please the palate 
this together with wooden floors made my stay perfect 
right in front of the ny public library bryant park 
he recommended the famously delicious jin ok hwa chicken soup 
as gold club members we were able to use the lounge which is a very nice one with a great 
french toast 
no espresso on their normal menu and you can eat scrambled eggs 
but this area is right in dongdaemun 
faced a very busy street and the traffic was too noisy 
very average hotel and very far from the downtown or riverwalk very average hotel and very far from the 
the most impressive part for me was the gym 
our room 's large and well-equipped 
we stayed here with my sister and our families in one of the villas 
spa was lovely and room had a gorgeous terrace with great views over the river and the mountains 
allowing a group of the ubiquitous costumed saleswomen to occupy the central part of the lawn with 
the staff are extremely attentive and the level of service is excellent 
there was a large balcony which overlooked everything i mentioned before 
the breakfast room is a beautiful room reminisced of the past 
it is historic but also extremely comfortable with every modern facilities 
location is 2 minutes from bts thonglor station which gives you access to everything 
this hotel is famous for its roof top bar and lounge 
the bathroom was huge 
ok area 
many places in russia from hotels to restaurants seem to employ people who march to the beat of a 
they have a separate desk where you can order tickets to the ballet and other concerts 
higher floor 
( the bed is comfortable nut the living room for a suite is very small 
if you do n't like the train then you are fighting with bkk traffic 
and great toiletries in abundance 
fyi tip - the rooftop bar is a must and top notch views and ambiance 
too small swimming pool but the gym is ok 
the octave bar & lounge on the 42nd floor is impressive 
the rooms are bright and modern and the facilities and restaurants bars are great 
the 2 empty beer bottles and the ice bucket were not cleared from the room in 3 days though 
the lovely warm cookie was a nice touch 
it was also hard to adjust to the right temperature 
i hope to return to this great city one day and this hotel will be top of my list 
breakfast was in a nice area on the ground floor with huge variety 
excellent but for towels 
great sleep quality and reasonable price 
the breakfast was good 
big bathroom and bedroom with great view 
great quality and selection and super friendly service 
plenty of adjacent parking 
nice bath and showers 
the hotel is clean 
the hotel has a lovely indoor swimming pool and gym 
the executive happy hour had a generous variety of foods and drinks 
but i 'm usually around enough hotels to be able to objectively rate them 
i do n't have much to say as i was only here for 2 nights and was very busy 
there was a note on the air conditioning controls saying if the room is to hot you have to turn 
reliable internet 
and having access to the executive lounge was a great way to start the day with the family 
i was upgraded to huge suite which had a huge bedroom with big bathroom 
windows open in both bedroom and living room for air circulation 
room service vs slow-coffee shop closes at 3 
we ordered room service twice and found it to be on par though limited in vegetarian options 
the food and beverage are better than most and the staff are very helpful 
not enough coffee 
a large room on the sixth floor nicely furnished 
good water pressure and hot water ( much appreciated at -15 celsius weather ) 
and the breakfast buffet was delicious 
had horrible lighting and furniture 
having read some of the negative reviews here i 'm wondering if those people stayed at the same hotel 
asked if an upgrade was available and they stated they would n't upgrade me regardless as i was 
self parking is reasonable for 25 cad but it could n't be charged to the room 
internet is only free for ihg club members but sign up is free 
front desk staff not paying attention to details 
check out the next day was as smooth and friendly as check in 
the club lounge was above average for this standard of hotel and worth the additional cost 
their seafood buffet for 55 overlooking the beach was very reasonably priced 
booked this hotel through scoopon and grabbed a really good deal and i was thinking that they might 
the good stuff first - very helpful staff on reception both when i checked in and when i needed directions 
a spa & the windjammers restaurant was excellent 
aircon very cold 
you can smell urine across the bathroom and the bedroom- dunno how we got through the night 
large spacious reception and helpful staff 
top floor for less outside walls - this floor overlooks rooftops so more light gets through 
the windjammer restaurant had a good selection of food but also needs updating the plastic chairs are stained 
good location . 
bar served good value food 
very good breakfast choice and a great price 
the double glazed windows kept the room quiet and the airconditioning kept the room comfortably warm 
the room was on the 1st floor looking onto the road however it was triple glazed so we 
breakfast next morning was good and the quality excellent 
it is a great boutique hotel that has excellent service 
staff very friendly and helpful 
nice hotel and pool area is clean and tidyi 've stayed here before but was located in the 
has planes flying low over it and is on an island of major roads 
the beds are uncomfortable and the a c works not all the time 
the location is too far from most lisbon attractions but it 's a perfect spot for those 
pricing was quite good for the quality served 
rooms are clean but lack facilities 
metro subway is nearby if you wanted to head elsewhere 
cool aircon 
good linens and beddings and in room dining 
the corinthian is one of the best hotels i have stayed in 
reception area is nice 
thick fluffy towels 
this was a good airport hotel 
the bed linens had a distasteful smell and the room did not appear very clean 
opera house and main shopping area 
efficient front desk 
i would say that my only complaints with the room was that the bed was a bit too soft and 
my wife and i stayed here for 5 nights during our first trip to berlin in july aug 
they eventually gave us a free dinner in the excellent aubergine restaurant - but did n't make 
not by visitors ) and had an issue with repeated flies entering the room ( despite closed windows ) 
but would still prefer a separate bath and shower 
and i truly love this hotel , it is old school , stylish but not modern , very attentive 
has great amenities and staff is nice and helpful 
huge bathroom but still unfortunately had a combined shower bath 
we found many good restaurants close by 
breakfast for three was double the price of some very good dinners we had in berlin 
the bathroom is good with an excellent shower and complimentary toiletries 
and compliment the wonderful staff 
with a good hotel breakfast 
truly beautiful relaxing and quiet 
walking distance to brandenburger tor and in the same street as checkpoint charlie 
also a large but old modern bathroom 
good rates value and convenient location 
generous sized rooms with great service in a quiet but convenient location 
we could n't check out early and they allowed us until 230 pm to settle our bill and move 
we tried the spa and had one-hour massage 
they provide an android phone that allows you to make phone calls - domestic or international free 
all the hotels were either full or very high priced 
i only visited one place 
we have booked on executive floor and had access to lounge especially happy hours are our main concern food was 
the hotel is worn out and has quite some lapses 
staff remember your name which is pretty nice . 
we immediately returned to the front desk 
had just quick overnight and flight out from aep before 7am 
and it is located right at the heart of the shopping and pedestrian zone 
did n't use but the pool area looked beautiful 
there are certainly more interesting hotels to stay in when visiting buenos aires 
the hotel is located a stones throw away from the gas lamp district which is a brilliant place to go 
cleanrooms clean and spaciousking room has glass enclosed nice showersgood water pressurestarbucks in lobby of 
the downtown area can be chippy and there was an elderly couple got jumped right by the entrance in 
as requested we got a high floor smoking room away from elevators facing the river 
the room is of reasonably size with a big king bed 
swimming pool and ground area between the two towers are nice but guestrooms are really not that big 
make sure you add the cost for parking to your budget 
the bathroom large and the bed 
there are plenty of good restaurants within a short walk and the hotel restaurants are good 
big rooms - get one over-looking the harbor 
bathrooms are done up nicely but hanging space is minimal 
but having a city hotel located next to a marina makes it unique 
as a royal ambassador member took advantage of the guaranteed 8am check in ( early arrival from europe 
two tvs and large bathroom with separate bath and shower - plus a good view of the marina 
the plastic bath had a crack in it and was unusable 
this is a truly excellent hotel with many good facilities 
the property is newer 
the pool area is lovely especially for the children 
with bath and separate shower 
it is still possible to open the window to get fresh air but those who need a c will definitely 
pools and beach area were fantastic and all the restaurants were good 
we only stayed one night but would happily return again 
the bathrooms had a tub and a separate shower 
good breakfast spread served in the main restaurant 
we had 5 nights on half board for an unbelievable price 
rooms are nice with reasonable sizes 
offering fantastic travel options for getting around tokyo 
checking in large tour groups and providing map local information 
a king-sized bed ( with a mattress that is a little too soft ) 
spacious room with full amenities and great view 
i stayed two nights here during my most recent business trip to tokyo 
at the front desk 
staff are top notch - professional and courteous 
there were various restaurants and historical sites 
it 's staff and service quality is excellent 
including the convenient express train to narita airport which is walking distance ( if you do n't get 
the beach is lovely and the situation ideal - so the arrival of three more large resorts that we can 
a little expensive in my opinion but the team make sure the guests are looked after 
the room is spacious though 
before the planned wave of development makes it crowded - at the moment the furama is the only show 
although wifi not as fast as it should be 
the general manager and staff here are first rate 
my stay at the taj boston was amazing really liked it had an awesome experience good food good 
great hotel with the convenient location 
the t gets you more or less anywhere over the city and is very cheap to buy a weeks pass 
waterfall ( like a massage for your neck and shoulders ) 
the hotel room was really nice with the stunning lake view 
you ca n't complete your trip in positano 
poor service 
was there for 4 nights on business and did not get my usual intercontinental due to some conference and 
and at a signifcantly lower price 
big windows 
the toiletries are good ( milton brown ) 
the faux antique furniture in our room was a little bit scuffed and dinged 
it was short walk to the klcc 
good food and great service in a nice ambience 
this hotel is an oasis in a great location within the wanda brand 
staff are ordinary at best and typical taxi rip off stand out front the price is double today sir 
there is and paulaner just some hundreds meter away if you like to have some other beer 
we were tossing up between this and the shangri-la which were around the same price and 
i received a friendly welcome in reception and was pleased to find i had been given an upgrade to an 
their cold hams and cheeses are worth it and the choice of breads excellent 
the accommodation was faultless try the jane eyre suite its very nice and on a corner plot 
location is the best for shopping and sightseeing in leeds 
kiddie pool and hot tub 
nice shopping street 
it has a good range of facilities 
lots of places to eat and shop nearby . 
the bar was very trendy and had a good vibe 
large room and good bathroom include a nice balcony to sit and relax 
it was also just a short stroll from the station which was handy for me 
we enjoyed the food as we ate in the restaurant one evening and it was good food 
very good business hotel 
the public spaces of the hotel look fresh and well maintained - the guest rooms are in need of a 
nevertheless i did receive my starwood upgrade and free wi-fi 
great pool and staff who attend to your every need 
still think it 's way outrageous for mini bar price 
the only small annoyance was the safe in a drawer which could only accommodate the thinnest of items 
keep up the great hospitality and i am sure others would have similar feedback for you 
the restaurant had great buffet 
the food in the restaurant is very good and i would recommend this hotel for business travel 
i have to say this is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at 
the only downfall is the lack of amenities ( and the ones they offer are very low quality ) 
overall very nice facilities with helpful staff 
a beautiful hotel 
make certain that you check your credit card transactions during your stay if you decided to stay at this hotel 
as soon as we check in at 10 pm we are told restaurant closes at 10 
breakfast buffet was decent with a good selection 
great amenities 
very tasty and great looking meals 
is actually a town bus that just happens to go past the hotel to the gondola etc and 
the concierge who gave excellent suggestions for touring and a special mention to chas in the l 
helpful and knowledgeable staff 
it was n't a particularly comfortable stay - the area was rougher ( even though it was 
location is good if you are driving as it is outside the limited area 
the suite was lovely and nothing to complain about in any way 
a nice sitting area to enjoy the beautiful views 
i need a vinasun cab and the porter helped got one for me - was appreciative 
hospitable staff and great views of the rocky mountains 
if you feel like walking to ben thanh market 
as we were only there 2 nights this was n't an issue for us but could become so if 
with beautifully put together rooms and interesting public areas 
great rooms ( nice views all over the city ) and good location ( in a quiet area 
we used the laundry for 1 day and prices were reasonable for a 5 ( half or a third of 
the quality of the breakfasts by the quality of the croissants - and they were excellent 
concierge was helpfull and the staff was very kind 
even if you 're not staying here , you can shop high-end stores , eat a fantastic 
we were n't that hungry on the friday evening and decided to visit the rooftop bar for a 
take a vespa tour too if you can 
staff is extremely helpful and rooms are tasteful and spacious ( by tokyo standards ) 
the rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed 
the pool at the hotel is an infinity pool which is an ok size 
there is a walk in closet connected to an equally spacious bathroom with a full-sized bath tub with 
get the side facing the palace if you can - beautiful view of the palace 
we have chosen the capitol tokyu again due to the central location 
it is without doubt one of the greatest bargains i have ever encountered 
the room was spacious and had all the essentials 
overal a good choice for a short stay in sydney cbd 
just a small hanging wardrobe 
the people of this city are so friendly and helpful 
good facilities 
ask for a high floor with harbour view 
the room we booked was supposed to be a 1 bedroom deluxe apartment but from the looks of it 
they upgraded me to a one-bed deluxe apartment which was actually one slightly bigger room with a 
predictably - high for to rear of hotel 
everything about this hotel is top quality 
concierge excellent as are reception staff 
a nice big room with great amenities and very clean 
positive great and smooth check in and checkout comfortable bedsgood size roomnegatives - these are quite significant 
great entrance 
the gym is quite nice 
when the amex program works it really make a difference and is really worth the extra cost 
the views in the back facing the mountain were nice but the poolside is even better as you do 
nice lunch and excellent dinner ( we opted for half board which i recommend as a la carte dinner 
very noisy air conditioning 
the hotel overlooks the sea and has wonderful gardens and pool area 
the pool bar would rustle up a great cocktail while the table du royal was available for haute 
rooms are a good size 
the lifts are tiny ( they can hold about 2 people with luggage or about 4 people 
hot cereals 
the area 's not great but i would n't say it 's particularly dangerous 
as this particular hotel does n't come close to the grand hyatts throughout asia and the like 
indoor and private outdoor showers 
easy walk to many dc landmarks 
beautiful cottages but service could be better 
with lots of restaurants and a supermarket if you want to get out of the hotel 
there are also two shopping malls nearby too 
no major complaints - its a bit dated and in need of a facelist but overall acceptable quality 
location close to the airport and free shuttle available 
this is just on the outskirts of dallas centre obviously a short taxi ride away 
the bed was very comfortable and bathroom good 
so that was an unexpected bonus 
staff very friendly 
baby elephant comes out to breakfast deck daily where you can feed him 
we were handed our room keys and off to our deluxe king on the third floor at the back 
also observing a vet check and then helping bath the elephant ( no riding though ) 
we ate dinner here and the bill was vastly confusing 
i still believe there are way nicer hotels at the same rate ( or even slightly lower ) that could 
the staff is the typical hard rock style 
the staff are always good and the privilege for platinum member is very good ( much better than holiday inn 
we had a roxity suite which is completely catered for young young children and girls 
there are lots of restaurants & bars close to the hotel too 
there are some very nice restaurants within walking distance of the hotel 
4 ) breakfast choice was plentiful but quality was not there 
the extra roll on bed was sagging a bit in the middle 
one of the best pools in malaysia both for kids and couples 
my stay was overall an average one but the food made up for it 
able to enjoy great seaview and poolview 
very good location to travel around bangkok with two options of trains within reach to the hotel 
and all the nearby shopping malls 
i called the front desk at holiday inn 
though i 'm not sure if my long flight had anything to do with it 
a nice pool though the sand were a tad too coarse to be enjoyed 
welcome drinks is a nice touch 
buffet breakfast was good and hotel is close to sky train 
light lunch 
high floor 
my 2-yr old daughter enjoyed the pool access and the fun slides they have 
there was a nice sitting area with couches just off the elevator 
loved the o2 lounge on the roof . 
breakfast offered a full cooked american breakfast as well as abundant bakery selections 
for my next visit ill try other hotel in moscow 
bilbao it must be said is a spectacular city and melia a very well located hotel 
the whole atmosphere was special and to top it off the view to the kremlin and towards red square 
certainly on higher floors ( 6 and up ) 
the concierge were very helpful and had lots of good tips for places to dine 
the indoor parking was unfortunately fully booked and i had to use a public parking ( maybe 5 minutes walking 
very typical ibis room - compact but effective 
i guess it is true that you get what you pay for and luckily the room rates at the ib 
diagonally opposite mbk mall 
it gives an added touch if you are a loyalty member 
it is n't great value either but it is optional so the various pastry places are ready alternatives 
one of the best value for money hotel i ever stayed 
i wo n't be back , it 's an overblown easy hotel . 
the bathroom is also very basic and a tad small 
despite we have re-confirmed our late checkout 
the noise from the street makes you think that you have the windows open 
and the bed and bedding was super comfy 
fantastic hotel what a hotel . 
up until 2010 i stayed often in this hotel and pleased to see that it has only gotten better 
wonderful breakfasts - a real oasis in busy london 
the front desk folks remember the last visit you made 
get a room on a high floor so you do n't hear all the city noise below 
and old luxury forniture that looks more old than what they actully are 
many cafes and restaurants in easy walking distance 
there is a spacious bar lounge area with complimentary tea coffe available 
we recently completed two stays totalling 4 nights at this great hotel 
very good business hotel 
also in a great position in the city -5 minutes walk to the main sites and shops 
indoors are several shops 
( 5 ) the telephone type shower in the bathtub had a broken hose and sprayed water all over 
ollantay is a wonderful little town and the perfect gateway to mp 
the windows do not have screens and there is no air conditioning or ceiling fans 
breakfast was good with pancakes cooked to order 
this hotel really is located in the train station 
lacks personality and has a terrible wifi 
the lobby area and the staff 
petitenget , seminyak , kerobokan , seminyak , 
really nice reception area and bar restaurant 
it is even free on most buses outside london these days 
stayed in 108 and had a wall outside the window 
a modern lobby with beautiful city views 
the staff were truly amazing 
the executive lounge offers a nice hideaway and continues the theme of excellent views of the river and city 
and really dark and uninviting public restroom areas 
parking on site in a secure underground car park 
location is a little too far to walk back to the hotel from central newcastle 
it is n't the cheapest rooms around 
funky music and nice little touches ( free anti mosquito spray called buzz off etc ) 
neat design but thin mattresses 
the concierge was quite helpful and pointed us in the right direction 
that being said the rooms are excellent especially the ultra modern it tv connections 
being close to the metro station 
minor 1 a dirty wash hand basin on arrival in the room2 no bottle opener for the mini 
both rooms were not of a high standard with regards to cleanliness the executive area was a very small 
there is an amazing vibe 
you have to go to the shower and wash your hands 
peaceful ambience and discrete service 
almost spent my entire day lounging by the pool and the beach 
superb customer service 
the service was top notch as always and we have to give a huge thank-you to rina 
i must say it was probably one of the best hotels that we stayed in sri lanka - 
the main pool at the hotel complex is very cool 
the breakfast spread was excellent and the waiters were attentive and friendly 
3 hours to be exact with w retreat and spa bali 's front desk 
so last time i stayed there i said never again but was unfortunately forced to since my favorite hotel was 
2 ) the bar area - is a bit mixed 
took 10 minutes to checkin and there was no queue 
the breakfast room is spacious and the buffet is large and diversified 
everything in the villa was nicely designed 
i first stayed at the w when it opened 
efficient business centre and executive lounge 
it 's a walk across the park to get into town and the streets can be deserted after sunset 
the frosted glass between the toilet and the room brought us closer together 
it was so blah that i wanted to keep my blinds closed so as to not spoil my time 
lobby area is stunning and rooms are beautiful and very well appointed 
if this sort of service is indicative of the quality of the hotel 
not for a holiday hotel stay unless i needed to be at the airport in the middle of the night 
get to the front desk and they say oh your so and so and you can check in 
just amazing outside space ( pools and garden 
club lounge excellent 
dinner at the hotels restaurant was of highest quality and tartare can only be recommended 
the property has 2 large pools and lots of small private pools scattered across the area between the hotel and 
lovely big rooms and facilities 
amazing for an old-fashioned chap like myself who was brought-up to assume the worst of 
the beach on saadiyat islands is one of the most beautiful beaches in the uae 
room and bathrooms were spacious but the upkeep was not up to the mark 
the title of a previous review was beautiful but lacking a soul 
i usually hate cookie-cutter hotel chains like marriott but this property blew my socks off 
grand sitting areas 
clean nice hotel 
we walked through the design lobby and the swimming pools to the beach house 
rock hard mattresses 
wat xieng thong and the mv luang say pier are all short walks away 
room was nice and bed was comfortable 
separate bath and shower 
all international cuisines form a part of the generous spread however 
being on the 2 floor i really felt in the middle of the party so loud it was 
stayed there in transit overnight 
there is a very efficient concierge and front desk catering to our needs 
- 20 minutes later while we were relaxing in the bar we saw the same guy check a couple in 
restaurants and tourist attractions than you can possible take advantage of 
i loved the open kitchen and the fact that breakfast was la carte and cooked to order 
apparently they offer access to a nearby gym but i did n't try it 
some of the best interior decor and furnishings of any hotel 
hotel is a non smoking hotel and strict security assured the guests follows the healthy procedures 
more expensive hotels 
the check-in is a bit 'kelam-kabut' 
great location location - right at the edge of heritage centerroom - large and comfortablebathroom - 
both tea room and greenhouse were locked and no one was available at all when i went to the spa 
the lady reception located us at the smoking floor with my 1-year old infant and 4-years 
more sabah teabags- you name it 
the rooms and bathrooms are also renovated and the furniture is a lot of wood 
and the view from the higher floors over the shoreline are magnificent 
i stayed on the 21st floor and the view is magnificent 
the selection of food was very good and the food itself was delicious 
with limited options 
the hotel being almost opposite to the airport 
it will be my obvious choice for my next trip back to sandakan 
bathrooms were great with malin and goetz toiletries the beach is dirty and not worth visiting 
the roof top is really good for gatherings and outdoor yoga and bbq but unfortunately not available for 
we love the small pool in our own villa 
we visited the spa for a 90 minute couples massage and the staff were very professional and talented 
i ran after the bus like a mad woman 
checked in around midnight to find a completely overwhelmed front desk staff of two people who could hardly keep up 
food and drinks were good but menu could use a little updating to add some more healthy choices beyond salad 
there was a wonderful-sounding grand piano 
the dupont metro stop is a short walk away 
ours were on the second floor and whilst not luxurious acceptable for what we paid 
spacious and clean 
room rates very reasonable given the quality of the internal spaces and the food and beverages offered at the property 
only criticism is that bedroom internet wifi is very very slow and service in bar is mediocre 
despite all the positive reviews on this site 
this hotel is a funny one - its a hideous building in a fantastic location 
we called rececption 3 times in one night to complain about this but they refused to act - 
modern and spacious 
i stayed at room 1207 and i can hear the honking horns on the street level and loud 
the pillow and mattress were pretty comfortable though 
one thing i did not like was seeing all the rodents outside the area late at night 
check-in is on the first floor 
the bed and oversize pillows were very comfortable 
service very good and location excellent if you are doing business in the valley 
the check-in was professionally done and we were escorted to the room and the front office staff provided 
the staff was nice and helpful 
the bathroom was large & spacious 
i 've given this a four star rating purely because the views from the hotel are absolutely breaktaking 
we also enjoy the beach and the swimming pool although the pool size was very standard and small 
rooms were clean and shampoo soap been added to each day 
this will probably change once the new airport opens 
this was a lovely hotel 
bed was very comfortable and english television 
only complaint is about the complete lack of knowledge about 
20 minutes walk or a tuktukthere is no doubt that this hotel will be the best 
with a large bed and well appointed bathroom with good shower 
breakfast is a deal breaker 
decent prices and friendly environment 
the lounge also offered a nice setting to relax or have small meetings 
the location is great - a lush area of the city near connaught place and the embassies 
view was fantastic and totally a green area - magnificent 
the room 201 was very quiet could not hear anything from outside the room 
highly recommended . 
fabulous rooms 
horizon club is well worth the extra ( try to stay on the top floor for higher ceilings ) 
hotel has this amazing spa 
they have a good bar downstairs with a wide range and good staff 
the bed is nice & comfortable 
the staff were all very friendly an efficient 
restaurants good 
hotel is at good location near central of new delhi 
note that you can also sit outside near the pool area to enjoy your breakfast 
but the room was pretty dated and my massage treatment at the spa had me shivering at the end 
) staff is very polite 
an excellent hotel fulfilling the needs of the business traveler 
the tv was a wee bit small for the room size but will do - limited choice of business channels 
the pool is large which i really liked as i enjoy swimming lengths 
good value 
the car service from airport is an executive sedan with english driver 
loved the roof top pool 
fabulous location and nice hotel 
i wish i could have stayed longer to enjoy the pool and the other facilities 
we may be even friend with some but we are guests first and should be treated as such 
my patio was right on the strip and on a high floor ( 15 ) so the street beach noise 
room was spacious and had amazing views of copacabana 
there was small dining table and room as you walked in with a very large lounge beyond that 
the room is clean and good 
the bath was lovely and deep though if only i had time to enjoy it 
quiet gigantic resort hotel in bali 
it was facing the bay so the ambiance was very nice 
no smoke from the adjoining casino 
by the way that offer decent stay 
the place is so enormous that it is quite a hike to make it to the nearest beach fronted 
the resort is quite large 
a true 6 star resort 
the internet was spotty as it remained throughout our trip 
the suite was huge 
we could walk there in less than 5 minutes 
this hotel is pretty new - completed remodeled from the former hotel on that site ( think it was 
the windows are not soundproofed and the sirens go on all night2 
on my first visit a year or so ago there was a dreadful stagnant water smell around the hotel which 
everything looks and feels new in the room 
well located in the centre of the city right on mg road 
the location is about a block or so away from the magnificent mile and that 's pretty much where 
breakfast buffet is great 
no free drinking water was provided 
we had a lovely afternoon tea 
the building is a delight but lots of small sets of stairs up 
the general manager 
we received a complimentary upgrade to a suite 
gardens and pool were lovely 
the pool area is nice 
the room and shower are big and the garden facing rooms are better 
throughout my stay all the staff were exceptionally polite and helpful 
pool and gardens are beautiful 
one of the best hotels 
on the plus side - good location close to bts train stationa couple of excellent and well known 
cleaning immaculate ( staff even replaced personal toiletries that were running low ) and rooms very 
the asian restaurant is lovely - in that you sit outside and enjoy the evening same with the pol 
the breakfast spread is great and the hotel front desk is very helpful 
small cozy hotel with comfortable room and friendly service 
and the supposed fine dining restaurant is particularly poor 
the ratio of staff to guests must be very high as there always seemed to be someone around to help 
the coffee is also great 
there 's a lovely park with a lovely playground just down beside the hotel for that lovely morning jog 
internet good and nice view of cruise-ship pier 
my third stay at the hotel - love the hotel 's proximity to emporium mall and room 
the concierge asks you to email the document to them and they can only print simple text or 
we did n't eat there because the choices in the area are so good but the club floor breakfast 
the food at this hotel is excellent 
the concierge was very helpful in getting me tickets for ballet and guiding for everything 
rooms are beautiful ( though small ) 
it is perfectly located , right next to the general staff building of the hermitage - which 
we asked for a water view and they accommodated 
well located for downtown 
shower fast before it changes on you 
about 2 hours later i recieved another call to check how i was doingconceirage had 
the service here was very attentive and the atmosphere peaceful and relaxed 
there was a great manager happy hour with drinks and snacks in the gorgeous lobby 
we walked straight out the front door to the new years pitbull concert and midnight fireworks 
a sitting area and a large comfy bed 
the pickpocketers come in a group of 5 men trying to get off a subway train while you 
the room was very warm and stuffy but was fine once the window was open 
numerous shops nearby for drinks and snacks ) 
there is free parking for guests ) 
although they are already showing signs of wear and tear with coffee stains on the carpet and curtains and squ 
subtle lighting at floor level comes on so you can find your way in the dark 
it is nice to get a well-lit place with good access to powerpoints and slippers and 
cozy rooms 
there were plenty of power outlets and counter space for all our personal belongings 
the bed has a good firmness 
the hotel food is adequate and if you need more options close by the shangri-la is 
the room is large about 50square meters it is new and bright in day time with a very well 
i can spend my money in other real 5 star hotels in guangzhou 
luxurious bathrooms etc 
lounge at 40th floor has a good selection of wine and beers ( 3 kinds ) and hot 
dinner provided an excellent introduction to the best of cambodian cuisine and the breakfasts 
when staff stops to let you thru 
gorgeous pool area and kind 
breakfast is ok but a bit cheeky charging extra for espresso 
could do with some innovative items and better quality fresh fruits 
the bathrooms are small but well equipped with a lovely step in shower 
this is true hilton hotel with good service & high standard accommodation 
right in the middle of all the action with a decent restaurant and beautiful high lobby 
a nice hotel with friendly staff in a good position with comfy rooms - what more could you ask 
its a great hotel with a fantastic design and had a lot of improvement lately and it shows 
furnishings not in great shape 
and it is only a short 1 km walk over the victoria bridge to south bank and the museum 
not to mention we had booked a one bedroom suite and they upgraded us to a beautiful huge 2 bedroom 
bright and lobby hallways have the new car small you 'd expect in a place opened only 2 
nice views back over the city 
the only minor complaint is the air conditioner is a little bit loud 
other than in the exec lounge where welcoming staff stepped forward to offer drinks and they were also very helpful 
lobby is on higher floor 
my high light would have to be the delicious steak i had with some great fries 
breakfast was nothing special and in not such a big area which gets crowded easily 
when i 'd gladly swap all the other hotel nights for stays in this one 
we could have stayed at the more affordable ibis next door but this place is clearly a notch or 
breakfast area nice 
if someone is in the sink shower room and you used the toilet 
separate bedroom and huge tv room 
i am a big fan of fresh juices so was disappointed that there were none 
there also must be something wrong with the air conditioning in this hotel - the room smelled damp and when 
the rooms are a good size and the beds very comfortable and everything nice and clean 
does n't smell very nice and tastes even worse 
when we pulled into the front entrance we were greeted by a friendly member of staff 
which you can and hear the noise of the freeway 
this two storey massive hotel sits between the route 1 freeway 
finally a haven in brisbane very impressed the last 2 times i have stayed here , from 
which was a shame as this is a great resort 
the property is nice within the golf 
my room was spotless and the bed very comfortable 
however its a short walk around the block 
the door does not lock without someone pulling the handle hard to hear the click and there is a ceiling 
firepits and heated pool were nice for jan trip 
sterile and bad choices of small dishes 
service is good and were given free breakfasts when checking in 
conceirge or room service just rang out 
great bedding 
it 's more appropriate of a property for one of those chains 
but the food is just not high quality or fitting for a french hotel 
we had the set evening meal which was very good the evening staff ca n't do enough for you 
room is clean 
room service and bar restaurant are great 
a pleasant bar 
water sports were available within close proximity to the hotel 
i find all the staff to be courteous and attentive and they really did a great job 
the first large pool also has a nice pool bar 
spread was great and quality was good 
everything here is luxury and comfortable 
stayed on club level and they had good facilities in the club there although they could do with a 
the resort has a private beach which is great but the vendors selling water sports activities at the beach are 
best located in antwerpen nice room on executive floor . 
the staff here a very friendly and attentive 
when it comes to true 4 hotels 
people on the 2nd floor and above could easily see into your bathroom day or night 
bed was comfortable with a pillow selection menu if you desire 
the design is fine - very modern - good size with very comfortable beds 
table and chairs stuck next to a pool table and in most cases are out of proportion 
location superb and very good executive floor lounge 
my room was spacious 
just staying for one night at the antwerp hilton 
- no free wifi- busy lobby 
the facilities are so nice more than expected 
our spa package was a great bonus with often extra time on our 60 allocated minutes 
i can recommend getting a massage at the beach side pavilions that are part of the sofit 
bath room is great ( water pressure should be stronger ) 
i recommend this hotel to those who would like to stay at a nice boutique hotel right in the middle 
the swimming pool was indoor and large 
beds are perfect 
they dont change the used shampoo and shower gel and there is no body lotion at allthere is 
and a bar in one corner 
the hotel was at about 70 occupancy ( they said ) and the pools did not seem at all crowded 
spa treatment wonderful ( although the spa could do with some water - at least a big hot tub 
our family stayed in this resort and had a very nice stay 
both at dinner and breakfast and the service was good 
my biggest issue with hotels ( which i stay in every week for work ) is that the beds and 
good food and efficient service it 's hard to imagine that rudding will disappoint 
the arrival by boat is lovely and a great way to arrive at the hotel - i would far prefer 
such an amazing location 
the patio outside could be great place to relax and watch the lake 
the beds were really comfortable and the pillows were great too 
foh staff were excellent 
the staff on the front desk need a special thank you as we misplaced a number of items on our 
there is a great mini bar in fact one of the best i have seen so far with a very 
the public area is a bit of a muddle 
they were what you would expect from a quality hotel like the intercontinental chain well done team 
it is somewhat old fashioned but also of high quality 
for a cool drink bathed in cool colours 
nice hotel 
we ate dinner in the restaurant on one evening and found it to be of good quality and nicely presented 
had black mold in spots and the shower head was gross 
location is quite good to walk down to the more interesting areas of lisbon ( 10-15 
free wine and chocolates etcthe 
i was told that the prepaid non-smoking king deluxe room was not available - only options were 
dirty carpet 
rooms were standard 5 star rooms nothing extraordinary 
i stayed in a club executive room which is in fact a great spacious suite with separate living room 
the free wifi was a good strong signal and speed 
the gym is fantastic and whether you are looking for fitness equipment or serious bodybuilding 
it 's not close but not a bad walk either 
carpeting looked very old- some bathroom fittings cracked or not working properly- very dirty windows 
great thai hospitality 
did n't enjoy spending over 10 for a beer either , guess they just wanted to buy just one 
however this room was needing more repairs - toilet made loud glugging sound for 15 min after 
immediate area is a little run-down and not a great deal of quality shops eats drinks 
decor was modern 
very nice hotel lobby 
the rooms were decent and well-apportioned 
would be nice if the spa worked past 9pm 
good value 
mthere is also a really good coffee shop attached to the foyer 
serves many good food choices although after many dining experiences in other deluxe hotels and resorts make the 
the room was comfortable and all the amenities one expects to have 
nice service and very polite staff2 
the omani night buffet was very good and room service was also good 
just without the casinoit has a huge mall connected to it 
the food in the restaurant was good 
as the sun went from the main beach by about 3pm whereas on sunset beach it lasts until about 
here the accomodation is good and there is shopping and best is the theme outdoor park and 
rooms are spacious with a great bathroom and the sea view rooms have a nice balcony that we loved 
a hotel with an impressive lobby and equally impressive front desk area 
i 'd highly recommend the moroccan restaurant for dinner and the tranquil tea time on the patio 
the breakfast buffet it huge in size with lots of variety for every ethnical background 
great pool and private beach 
nice to be next to mall for food 
the staff very kind and considerate and incredibly helpful 
attentive pool and beach staff quickly bring small coolers to sunbathers filled not only 
sorbets and ice creams are brought round the pool during the day time n nthe breakfast 
) the bathroom was modern and clean - shower over bath with good water pressures 
everything is withing walking distance and there is parking available at the hotel 
one of the best moments of my life was watching the baby turtles hatching and the rangers helping 
fantastic breakfast - beautiful food & attentive staff 
and i was only only in a single occupancy room 
we shared two rooms a 
the reception staff gave great advice on where and how to navigate around the old town 
but the common areas and rooms look decent on a surface 
the process of checking was very good 
you also get free sunbeds on the bech 
spent 5 nights in totalthe good- location 
it is not per guest . 
the pool is a decent size 
the rooms are small and both the rooms and the hotel are a little dated but the staff are friendly 
breakfast and location was good 
convenient shuttle to jr rail 
excellent customer service 
convenient and central location also 
the shuttle from osaka station was great 
he immediately upgraded my room to a corner suite 
and separate bedroom 
luxury design hotel with history ( mandela ) unique setting in gardens of sandton sandhurst with 
you only have to look at all the other reviews on here to see other guests saying the same 
the egoli suite is more of a large open area bedroom and living room 
and a stay we will never forget the hotel lies in the middle of sandton ( the cc and 
absolutely wonderful - one of the best hotels we 've ever stayed in 
the staff was super friendly and nice 
the staff at the front desk was very helpful and the shuttle bus they arranged to and from the airport 
dining service close by in your villa or your room 
steak house legendz was also top notch 
couple of really good pools 
and don t miss the restaurant ! 
typical ic with excellent service 
took a seat and ordered some light snacks 
a colonial type of hotel with fantastic staff who cannot do enough to serve 
this together with only a few older guests wandering around in dressing gowns all was back to normal service 
they have a well equipped gym 
the gym is excellent for a hotel 
the food available on the executive floor was not good - so we descended to the ground floor and ate 
the access to the beach and the dining were solid 
and brought a cake and sparklers and the kitchen staff to wish me the best 
even though the mini bar is free 
the bed is horrible as it is super hard 
not a central location but only a short taxi ride away from most attractions and a good 
the good thing about the hotel were the nice front desk staff 
for similar prices 
a 15 minute ( in traffic ) cab ride to the other side of 3rd ring road is around 
the staff are very friendly and helpful 
the excellent marriott bed 
i observed at least one large conference in-house during our stay 
lovely soft beds 
the central areas are feeling a little 'tired' 
the check-in can get busy if there is a conference group ( there is almost always a conference 
please be warned parking at the hotel is extremely expensive and there are cheaper spots nearby which you should explore 
rooms are spacious and quiet the beds very comfortable 
the staff were always able to offer advice 
24 hour public parking kitty corner is far quicker and half the price 
great value for what you get 
but the room service and housekeeping was very normal 
it has a great location right next to the moscone centre on one side and downtown on the other 
as are the landscaped tropical gardens 
is just the best ( the water was at perfect temperature 
they were a great treat after spending a hot and busy day exploring 
the breakfasts are plentiful and the evening meals lovely 
room amenities were good 
the street inside thehotel gives you enough noise that you had to wake up 
perfect for city centre shops 
black out curtains 
such a wonderful setting 
if you want charm and exoticism that represent the hotels long history 
they keep their restaurants halal 
and were over free drinks at the bar while we waited for our room - which was a very nice 
our second stay 
they have a decent sized pool which most of the lounge chairs are faced towards ( about 5 pairs of 
bali has become one of the food capitals of the world with fabulous restaurants everywhere 
service is very friendly but can be better and loyalty is highly appreciated here . 
great views all around from the higher floors 
a quirky airport hotel 
the hotel is literally 2 minute walk from the departure terminal 
the living area is a delight and the ambassadors ( employees ) wonderfully engaged as active members of the community 
rather disappointed with the overall service 
overnight parking amsterdam schiphol and the 4th ot 5th solution was parking in front 
there is also a small kids playground next to the pool 
location wise is excellent - just a short little walk to the hive of activity of small little kuch 
when you have an early flight 
reception desk is an electronic terminal 
yes the rooms were not large 
so no time even to go for lunch first before checking-out 
we got a free drink ( as members ) at the bar 
they provide a range of pillow selection that you could request 
even the toilet is clean & spacious 
the executive lounge however is wonderfully lit and offers fairly extensive canapes 
there 's never a shortage of good lobby conversation 
i do n't think i 'd purchase breakfast but if included in room rate is worthwhile 
lounge and welcome drinks were really nice too 
if there are several people going to different floors 
agree with other reviewers breakfast selection is very good 
both rooms seemed positively huge compared to similar priced places we had stayed in rome and paris and 
if time is tight and you want to be close to the airport and the city this is perfect 
when compared to the rude and inexistant service at the towers of the waldorf astoria in 
rooms and social areas are bohemian chic and gives you a feeling that this hotel has been here 
with a relatively captive audience the meals in the hotel carry an expected premium 
this is the ultimate way to travel into the city and offers several drop off points along the opposite shore 
this hotel is awesome especially for us where we had our room overlooking the amazing sheikh zayed grand 
assuming the loud music of the pearls&caviar lounge until 2am and the airplane route 
i then went to sit on the private beach and was asked to sign another consent form 
you likely have ended up stranded at an airport hotel a few times a year 
the rooms were nice with balconies and make sure you take the ones facing the beach 
nice eating out area at night 
others have mentioned the cost of breakfast but compared to the one at hyatt regency boston 
the location of the hotel is absolute great - far away for the city center and the shopping arcades 
spacious rooms with a great view of the grand mosque 
the hotel itself is excellent and we really liked the indoor bar off the lobby and the amazing selection at 
they are trendy and easy to talk to . 
for the free club lounge 
and to double check any other details 
very impressive lobby area 
but very nice decor 
m . 
the the breakfast spread is as to be expected from a radisson blu hotel 
clearly if you want old world charm you should look elsewhere 
and loved the heated floor feature in the bathroom 
the rooms were clean and a good size 
my room is in the third floor facing the front street and the cathedral 
the room was very comfy and modern 
took about 15mins to get to from zurich airport . 
the toilet is good with a bath and closet but the wash basin is situated outside of the toilet 
has fitness center on top floor ( 15 ) with great views 
right across the forecourt is a very nice restaurant patisserie the steiner flughafebeck 
shower was slow and there was a funny smell 
the novotel is a comfortable hotel with nicely portioned rooms 
a number of roads around the hotel are closed and if you are driving to the hotel 
beware of extra charges 
service was excellent and rooms were comfy 
purple-walled toilet cubicle and separate shower bathroom area separated from the bedroom by sliding doors 
over the 4 nights the service was very good staff ere very friendly and the hotel is very clean 
modern and mini bar free 
and it was without doubt one of the better hotels i stayed at during my tripit is modern 
free mini bar was icing on the cake 
rome can be covered by foot and takes about a 4km radius walk from this hotel location to 
free mini bar with soda and a few beers 
you can walk around to all attractions which is great 
it was near a very busy street 
chose the novotel as a last resort as many other venues were booked over the vintage 
and fit a nice modern shower 
my best hotel in sri lanka 
our room was modern 
great view were upgraded to junior suite with a nice balcony and view . 
higher floor the better 
ok for a short stay 
service was also good with quick and efficient service 
we booked a 2 bed apartment which was large enough to put a trundle in for another child 
disneyland hotels may be convenient but are rather expensive 
they wnated us to put the towels on the floor which we wanted to change 
the rooms are basic but not expensive and provides a good place for an overnight stopover 
but we enjoyed the very spacious villa with a lot of rooms and space 
comfortable bed if you like it a bit firm 
who floats serenely around dispensing smiles and goodwill 
notwithstanding the wonderful ambience of the resort 
very cheap and convenient if you have early flights in the morning from auckland airport 
not many electrical outlets 
it is also a very good price compared to others 
although it takes less time to walk there 
which is silly when they are advertising free wifi 
it was an apartment style room and the kitchen looked very useful and functional even though i only used the 
free wifi is availble for 3 hours daily which is convenient 
would come back but would also insist on room higher up as ours looked at walls ! 
the pool was a pleasant temperature and good to relax after sightseeing 
it lacks the touch of intimacy and the convenience of being in the charming old town of sorrento 
one of the hotels best features is the view from the majority of rooms 
top floor right underneath penthouse 
as well as an expanded drinks selection at dinner too 
they applied their own unique opening hours and all drinks were not available all the time 
we had a great trip 
the bath was not cleaned out properly most days 
the lobby was amazing with a very open and inviting check in area 
the website does no justice to this beautiful hotel 
overpriced european restaurants and dilapidated infrastructure 
it was good value for the money we paid 
exceedingly hard beds which feel like you 've been beaten with bamboo stick in the morning 
excellent hotel in a great location 
probably one of the best hotels in kuwait 
book a high floor room with sea view 
solid reliable hotel for international business travelers 
rooms are spacious and the whole hotel is modern and relaxing 
the room was very dark 
the patio is also the restaurant which serves authentic ecuadorean food and a super selection of various 
the next two nights it was warm 
but i mostly just want a good nights sleep and there was no way to get that there 
rooms are a decent size and well appointed although the bathrooms could use some up-dating 
with high ceilings and soothing color schemes 
also the popular bangsar area id close for restaurants bars and the like 
and i complained and then i opened the windows 
the onkly problem was poor internet connection - i hope they will work on that 
the staff seem to struggle to keep the buffet restaurant clean and tidy 
the lobby is very busy with group tour 
management should work on fixing the elevators and the wifi 
the reception is as usual busy and long queue but the staffs are all friendly 
by the way the city is so very polluted wear a mask and watch your step 
the spread is very good 
it is well located near shops and famous sites 
breakfast is rather generous and tasty though it could be tough to find an empty table during the peak 
room size is small ( yeah 
as i was only staying for one night i did not bring this up to the hotel 
this was my first time to visit milan on business however the hotel captured me from the very first 
the room was of average size and clean but not exceptional 
concierge was of great help 
but the team at vintners hotel were super and complement the remarkable views from the units and the 
the furnishings are modern and the whole suite was very clean 
when i called the front desk 
and there was also an enormous bathroom 
the rest of the apartment is great as well 
historic hotel in the perfect location 
when i spoke to male receptionist he said thats how it is - i asked to speak to manager 
there are two indoors pools plus an outdoor playground which the kids loved 
dinner was lovely and the breakfast was fantastic 
since it is so crowded with tourists 
fine was disappointing but the way the matter was handled by receptionist and the manager was even more disappointing 
the rooms do require a makeover which was very disappointing in a hilton hotel but as always the 
the outdoor play area is free 
the rooms are nice and spacious but there is no gym so all with all just about ok 
the swimming pools and the beach and vice versa is nice especially to those who wants to burn calories 
we arrived late at this resort & had our dinner inside 
the view from the terrace is spectacular 
the rooftop restaurant was very nice but they charge extra to dine on the terrace which seems a 
if you drive there is a car park virtually next to the hotel called the golden pass and if you 
with fast ( free ) internet access and a great working desk 
the bed is very comfortable and the rooms are quiet 
the hotel lobby was small but the service was very efficient 
service standards were high at reception and certainly in the executive lounge which is very spacious 
the fine dining cantonese restaurant 
amazing hassle free way of seeing a concert 
the receptionist was very helpful and did assist me with changing some money into hong kong as 
no shelf in the shower for toiletries you have to place them on the floor 
had a nice balcony 
the room was large with an ocean view 
this hotel is typical of a resort hotel and has all the facilities and services one requires without having to 
with beautiful gardens 
food and beverage was seriously overpriced and of very poor quality 
food outlets and nearby eats are adequate but if you need to into town 
staff is extremely friendly and helpful although we were charged extra for the citysightseeing bus without being told 
this part of town was nice to walk around also in the evening the room was very small 
with frequent train services from the airport to the main station 
) the manta pavillion and wine bar has a varied pacific cuisine menu at dinner - excellent 
the main tower has 4 levels of rooms ( floors 5-8 ) and then there are four more 
so i may not recommend it for business trips but as a traveler in a new city 
there are n't a lot of options and the restaurants close at 8 
there are good restaurants within a short walking distance ( the helpful staff will give you directions ) 
fresh pastries 
my wife and i had found the beach last year and decided it was the place to spend her 40 
it is also in a convenient location right next to the metro and with hundreds of restaurants and bars right 
try and choose higher floor 
to the bellhop to the front desk 
if you compare this hotel against other big chain hotels in the area ( tokyu is a big 
with lots of comfortable seating and a huge bathroom with separate shower and bath in a massive bathroom 
as wrote before , this hotel is good if you have short stay between your flights since it is 
and you can order special coffee from the bar 
the hotel staff are incredibly helpful 
rooms are quite spacious and service is great across the property 
nice quiet rooms 
very average 3 star property 
we had a very pleasant stay 
to a rude and impersonal front desk staff 
i was checked in very fast and the billing amount was correct 
marriott is about the same price - much better experience 
food options at the hotel could use improvement 
hot and cold items 
all of the standard amenities you would expect where there 
and we felt like they may have given us a room based on the fact that we were n't 
friendly staff and lots of choice for breakfast and dinner close by 
the reception staff gave us local directions to restaurants and supermarkets and arranged a couple of day tours for us 
the infinity swimming pool is big and nice 
this hotel was excellent value 
we were met and greeted by a representative of the hotel at the airport and then took by a speed 
although i was alone most of our stay as my hubby went off to work in italy i 
huge outdoor balcony 
you still pay for internet access ( no matter whether in your room or in the club itself as wireless 
the room has a window blind rather than curtains 
the shower is great and the whole set up is given over to your comfort 
more windows that you 'd expect - even one in the bathroom 
shower very poor 
got a good price during the convention and would stay here again for business 
this hotel is in the heart of buckhead in atlanta and you can walk to lenn 
there are snacks that are available 24 7 
rooms are not very big but they re comfortable . 
great for a stopover 
and there 's no free wifi 
the front desk and concierge were helpful and friendly 
excellent hotel and service 
beds were fluffy and comfortable and the front desk concierge customer service was great 
big enough space to cater to family with children with basic toilet amenities 
we stayed for two nights pre-cruise and this was an interesting experience - we have stayed at 
quality establishment situated on the outskirts of the city centre but still within walking distance though you would n't 
lobby and amenities were good as well 
our flight back to the east coast was n't until 6 
one of the best airport hotel we have stayed at 
the facilities were good and the staff pleasant 
celebs all in one spot and a great place to stay 
no nice city viewsadequate breakfastcrowded lobby at times and you got to wait your turn 
we said higher floor and he gave us a good room with 2 extremely comfortable beds 
but it was well equipped and had a good bathroom with a bath and separate shower 
and i was impressed with the large hotel lobby - really it was very welcoming and felt nice 
allow one hour if you are unfortunate enough to book a room here 
rydges super bed or whatever it 's called was very comfy and restful 
we stayed overnight for a layover and it is an adequate airport hotel 
i once ordered late-evening room service 
flys where all around already and the smell imagine by yourself 
ask for a high floor that looks out the way 
hotel is close to world square monorail so it was very convenient and walking distance to server 
except for the coffee and tea ( they used very poor quality coffee and there were no teabags 
beds were good but bathrooms were tired and old 
the club catering was excellent and unfortunately 
this is a noisy part of town - try to get a room on an upper floor to minimise 
the executive lounge is very nice - while small for an airport hotel 
especially considering the high price 
with excellent parking 
the rooms are well appointed and have all the amentities you would expect from a superior hotel 
firstly the hotel lobby is bare 
the constantly changing led lights added a nice touch 
great location with very interesting design 
the main beach in nha trang is actually quite gross 
the airport is highly disorganized so nowhere to purchase a taxi voucher 
) the bathroom was big with the wc separated from the bathing area allowing 2 guests to use the 
overall a good resort with some good features and some bad features 
the one lady on reception phan tue is amazing but the club does not offer enough and the 
the quality is good 
but the front desk staf 
the breakfast buffet at feast restaurant is excellent and plentiful 
etc at great prices 
the room was nicely equipped and there were nice touches like the fresh coffee 
seriously good chinese food 
they do n't offer this fabulous bathtub in ordinary rooms 
firstly the negatives which are noise from the nearby construction sites and the constant horn blowing by the k 
great property and base of operations for touring or conducting business 
something i found true of all hotels in china but that did n't stop me from getting a 
we had booked two twin rooms and the reception staff had arranged them to be next door to each other 
it has now been refurbished . 
better rooms and especially better food and drink 
the rooms are modern 
the bakery located right next to the hotel offers delcious treats and i enjoyed visiting daily 
the hotels central proximity is a huge bonus for this place 
it was a pleasant visit 
n nthe staff at the lounge were very lovely and excellent in what they do 
internet is horribly slow 
and a good value 
wrote a long comment card to the general manager and also a an email to the management at the no 
if just for a short getaway 
standard business hotel wo n't exceed your expectations 
we tried oriental fried rice ( rm16 
the decor was not great and mostly green 
wait until the next market hotel s renovations are completed 
there is nothing within walking distance nearby the resort and you have to base all your f&b in 
this place is something similar but with less facilities 
large bathroom too 
the hotel is at international haneda airport 
cakes and desserts with meals and a good wine selection and the staff are uniformly friendly 
try to find something a little less pricey if you do n't plan to be there too long 
30 am and meant we could face the long queue for the morning flight having partaken of a nour 
pillows bad 
you can walk for long time and enjoy the greatness of the sun 
the resort is located about 10 minutes drive outside hoi an 
this resort is also quite a distance away from the ancient town 
this is one hotel that has an exceptional eye for detail and employees empathetic staff 
bathroom floor has extremely slippery tiles and great care is needed 
worth a visit 
it has outstanding service levels from all the staff members and a manager , jason that not only 
the beach is of good quality 
near city center ( go on the beach to find beautiful bars in the night ) - well maintained grounds 
breakfast was a small but high-quality spread 
was told on arrival that check in is at 3pm 
breakfast was pleasant but not up to par with what we experienced at other hotels in malaysia 
dinner on the beach was excellent 
for extra cost 
great facilities ( bars 
lovely personal touches 
turn right and after 50-10 meters on the right side you see the restaurant terrace ) 
this is a nice boutique hotel but does not deserve the 1 ratings 
the special room i wa given had dirty stained carpet holes in the walls dried food stains on the coffee 
it shot through our expectation with its elegant ambience and professional-butler like service 
hotel was perfectly located to explore statue of liberty ellis island venues and a short train ride to 
the second room was better and i could see the statue of liberty far far away 
there are some interesting and very good restaurant 
path train station is located next to the hotel 
charge for internet use ( it 's supposed to be more of a business hotel ) and the location 
i spend 180 nights year in hotels and the difference between good and bad hotels is always clear when things 
located in the wonderful ahuriri area 
2 double bedrooms with king beds in each with one having an extra bed but also the one with extra 
very handy service of meeting you at the airport when you return for a very reasonable extra 14 
people hang around in the small lobby with bags which makes it confusing as to who is queueing or 
a modern airport hotel 
and turn left into where the hotel is about 200 yards down from the roundabout ) 
an airport hotel is a necessary evilpoor breakfast compared to other hiexoverall i thought service 
after a quick call to reception and a visit from staff ( who were very helpful ) 
the check-in was very quick and the staff were exceptionally polite and helpful 
welcoming atmosphere- great views of the city and the pearl towercon 's 
with an even larger bathroom 
decent club lounge and great service 
excellent airport hotel 
reception staff friendly and hassle free car parking as rep on site 
room is very clean & spacious and air-con heater works perfectly fine 
yes the parking overnight is expensive 15 but i think this is the going rate for hotels around the airport 
with excellent small dishes and good wine 
nice and clean and new , but nothing special for the money central location in the business districtlacks 
but my impression is that the concierge is not knowledgable enough as once the advice 
this hotel is near to the main railway station in shanghai - but far enough away from the 
i stayed there for couple of nights including the new year eve 
the swimming pool and fitness are located in the main building and it is quiet a walk as you have 
ask for a lower floor ( hotel is already pretty high up ) and your room views wo n't 
restaurant options nearby are few and mediocre at best 
room service was always on time and the laundry service was impeccable 
if you go to the top floor ( bar- cloud 89 ) you will get an perfect view off 
also the grill restaurant is expensive much above the level it should 
the hotel is on the top floors of one of the highest building in shanghai 
free wifi which is always welcome 
the twin room consists of two double beds 
the mall is about a block away and is very nice 
i 've stayed at this hotel several times and would recommend for stopovers in delhi 
with a spacious shower 
on a block with several restaurants and shops 
cannot understand how they can mix so many high quality then add these junk products to the room 
this can create a logjam or wait2 ) the decor is old 
slow drinks orders and forget getting a second cup of coffee 
the dinner was very good 
buffet breakfast spread was nice too 
also while you get free wifi 
the hotel is in aerocity so top most location for the purpose 
definately one of the better hotels in the heathrow area 
probably in my top 10 of hotels throughout the world 
the hotel is brand new with large and perfectly equipped rooms as well as hreat food and huge breakfast 
but nice comfy bed and a nice bathroom 
it 's a great hotel - well managed 
the shuttle was convenient and runs often to the signature ( private jet ) fbo at logan 
with large excellent marriott beds - they always impress - big flatscreen tv and good channel choices 
easy checkout and regular bus service from reception area to the terminals 
shuttle service to airport is frequent but beware you have to call from inside the delta terminal before going 
- beautiful interior design- spacious room and bathroom- location is city center and very strategic- warm and 
and people did keep coming and going 24 hours - lobby bar menu is not available in next door brass 
perfect for an airport hotel 
due to commitments i found myself here for an overnight stay 
overall the hotel is very sympathetic to the original buildings & has maintained the character of the original buildings 
whether the open plan bathroom would suit all occupants in a twin sharing room - you would certainly have to 
decided to stay here for my birthday the staff were very friendly and the hotel was tastefully done 
this is a nice quiet place for a drink of the evening and the staff are very attentive 
brilliant use of an old building 
there is a minibar with free beverages 
the areas around the hotel are safe and quiet enough yet close enough to any sort of nightlife you 
i am planning a trip later this year to praha and will be booking here again 
the pool was large with shower and a sauna 
the restaurant food was excellent and the staff were very helpful being multi-lingual 
everything else was fine and nice to have complementary drinks in room 
which was a pretty decent sized room 
this hotel is south of the airport and right along the water 
the fruit and cookie platter provided as part of turndown service was a nice touch 
drivers associated with the hotel really should have common understanding of a reasonable price for trips to regular tourist destinations 
the construction on the freeway makes getting this hotel from any direction a nightmare 
many guests like this kind of predictability & sameness but for me 
a little way from sukhumvit however public transport cheap and easy 
from the brilliant recommendations from the concierge on where to eat and where not to go . 
service are pretty good at all restaurants 
mobile phone etc to the internet - you are charged additionally per connection 
it has 2 nice pools 
we are regular bali travellerwe booked 2 deluxe rooms for 3 nights stayfrom the first moment 
the breakfast are very good 
towers lounge rooms are best 
good in size 
check in and check out was very efficient and accurate which is nice to see 
concierge staff were very knowledgeable and helpful with meal recommendations and arranging transportation 
we were blown away by the high standard of the accommodation 
walking around the area to find good restaurants and sightseeing is a hassle 
the river really features throughout the hotel with great bar right on the river 
dining area outside in the courtyard weather permitting 
the executive lounge is excellent and the staff service brilliant 
where the woman at the desk was wonderfully friendly and helpful 
and the rooms are huge 
00am which is pretty late for people who are looking to get an early start to sightseeing to 
i think it good to ask st the time of booking if you can have a room overlooking the river 
a bit pricey on a paid basis compared to other hotels available throughout bangkok 
with the windows open 
they offer free shuttle boat service to the nearest skytrain station . 
the hi heathrow does everything that an airport hotel needs to do to a high level 
overall a decent property 
a good choice if you have an early flight at heathrow t1 
we needed to be close to heathrow we had late arrival and early departure so this hotel seemed 
there was a free hotel shuttleboat every 30 min 
higher floors with river view ! 
front desk is extremely efficient and go out of their way to be helpful 
nice size and marble bench makes it looks gordious 
tell a cab to take you to the holiday inn 
decent airport hotel 
they located in the small street that only 1 big bus can enter it 
valencia is a beautiful city 
i must admit that i was very impressed by the spectacular river view and excellent service at the tower lounge 
between the aragon station and the hotel there is a handy and very inexpensive supermarket named consum 
our big complaints would be that wifi is not free in the room 
all in all it is great value for money 
you easily get taxis outside the hotel 
breakfast was good but very busy 
rooms are generous in size and very well maintained 
the price was reasonable 
it 's about a 15 minute walk from the historical part of the city and the main commercial shopping 
which was actually the nicest floor of rooms 
underground garage available 
no fresh towels 
good bath amenitieswhat can be better 
good shower 
also a wonderful spa 
there are plenty of dining options nearby and the hotel itself has a very good restaurant 
i chose this hotel because of the reviews and the history behind the hotel 
did n't try any spa or pool though looking good 
bar and restaurant also overlooks that watering hole . 
hellish expensive but you get what you pay for stayed on the island which is much nicer than the 
the room was large and bath very nice with shower and large tub 
capetown has many excellent hotels where guests always leave happy 
dirty dishes left in the room 
on arrival check in was fast and friendly with a cold towel and a welcome drink on offer 
you can walk down to the waterfront very safely 
even had a really good coffee machine in the room 
we also had a spa package and the spa facilities are very good as well 
with lots of privacy and the lodging facilities are spread out very 
extensive wine selection available 
the grounds are immaculate and the service was great ( lots of people always available to help ) 
nice balcony opening up to the water stream with wonderful view of the hotel 
in terms of service the concierge was very helpful and the valet parking was very good 
you could not hear the slightest noise at all 
also close to mtr station 
my favorite part of this hotel location is the restaurant literally across the street called hay hay which is open 
missed breakfast due to late flight coming in and ca n't comment on this 
it 's located near t4 with limited on site parking that you need to pre-book 
excellent airport hotel 
room warm and everything you would expect and everything you would not expect 
would be nice if they had a daily specials so you got a bit more variety 
only a shower was present 
provided are the chocolates daily 
great restaurant 
communication was minimal , reckless , and service reflected this . 
very central location where you can walk anywhere 
but we could just imagine how beautiful it would have been since the property is very secluded and the 
avoid facing the float but also remember the train line running right outside the hotel which can blast you out 
i travel frequently and write objective reviews but this hotel has broken the one major travel law that you expect 
the free airport shuttle 
stayed at the suite and adjoining regular roompros 
separate shower & toilet 
the staff are extremely friendly and helpful 
a mini bar and a flat screen tv with limited channel options 
it was a superb hotel right from the decor 
the personal touch of roberto payer 
it 's close to the canals and the service we received was friendly and accommodating 
comfy chairs 
by the pool there is constant rock music played - noisy but not overpowering and to be expected at 
the swimming pool was quite big 
the drinks were expensive 
we got free upgrade and lounge access 
sometimes a long queue at the egg station or fresh fruit juice 
luxurious fittings and furnishings 
1st ( 7 floor ) due to cockroaches and finger nails ( not sure from where ) 
and we all agreed that it probably has the best facilities 
based on its size and location i would think it ideal for conventions and from what i can gather used 
the pool is good and attentive staff that constantly keeping my beer supply full 
easy to access entertaiment center also in pattaya 
rooms need a bit of a refresh ( paint perhaps ) but otherwise too notch . 
and a little indoor balcony 
the night before our lindblad galapagos tour and the the night on the return 
about 45 minutes into town but i 'm still not sure that its worth going into . 
with great views and a good sized desk 
you do n't get much space but the room is at least clean and the service is efficient 
i will probably not return and would try elsewhere next trip 
bed spread was nice 
the property is located adjacent to a shopping center 
toilet a bit small 
there are a lot of restaurants within walking distance too if you are willing to explore 
but there are enough noisy guests to make the hard beds 
very nice hotel in a nice city 
i guess they do n't want evening business--just walk down the street to the food court for 
have n't try the restaurants in the hotel yet but you can find some great bar and local food 
the management run this luxury five star like a three or four star hotel 
firendly staff , and they got a ticket for the same day i arrive to 
any hotel that has a card identifying ear plugs in the side table to help you sleep has a problem 
it was nice how big the washroom was 
the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quite modern and well appointed 
good bathrooms with underfloor heating which is a nice touch 
unfortunately our bedroom had a horrible smell when we arrived 
the restaurant is a little expensive but good quality food and the location not too bad 
good shower 
it occupies a former gasworks - quite an impressive building in the middle of a little park 
there were two french coach parties staying and they rather took over the place 
great air conditioning - only small complaint - there was n't a fridge as expected 
ask for a room with veranda facing north towards reception to be able to sit out in the shade 
in the day time the walk is hot and humid 
nice pool and spa 
bagan 's three main areas are really coming on fast 
and on the first day used a free drinks voucher that they gave us at check in for a couple 
perhaps they should either say something or greet guests and then move on or if they have had too many 
it is a large resort so choose a room close to the reception if you have problems walking although they 
the rooftop pool is a great place to cool down and watch the traffic from up above 
but nothing to justify their higher prices 
local restaurants just great 
we enjoyed a relaxing stay that was a very convenient point of departure for the early morning hot air balloon 
bathroom is big with toto automatic toilet and rain shower 
it was a reasonable sized clean room with everything we needed for a quick stop over in ho chi min 
this is not our first trip to suzhou but the first time we stayed at the intercontinental hotel 
big enough and well equipped gym 
snacks and lounge are always good 
one thing i look for in hotels are nice toiletries and i was a little disappointed that they only 
there is no such thing as a bad room at the crown towers 
totally worth the price 
service was top notch 
the upper floors are quieter 
bars and cafe 's were open 
the hotel has a great lounge 
the gym has loads of exercise equipment and there are even tennis courts that you can hire to keep fit 
food at the club lounge is one of the best 
an array of some of the best known chefs in the world , matched by australia 's 
which was one of the largest suite i have ever been out of all the hyatts i have stayed 
heated pool was nice 
it is a fair walk from the cbd and the shops and stuff 
beyond expectations pleasantly surprised . 
the lobby decor is interesting and many was snapping shots of the silver ball right in the middle 
high floor has a better view 
the lobby s like an airport with every tom dick and harry wandering through 
though we had a quick dinner at the hard rock and it was n't good at all 
after a tricky start and a rude member of staff telling us all sorts of untruths about 
service and even room service is amazing which i dont think i have ever said before ( you order on 
i found this remarkable given the number of guests at this large property and given the scope of their responsibilities 
penang is a good place to holiday as has such a variety - old china town to new 
ok hotel but located on a very busy mainstream set of roads 
clean with a shower over a small bath 
if you want some other top hotels 
they readily accepted my extra luggage for safekeeping 
our standard room was perfectly fine and the bed amazingly comfortable 
the bathroom had a separate shower cubicle and a good range of toiletries and towels 
the swimming pool is large if you 've younger children but may not be as nice for older children 
- the front desk is a mess 
one of my favourite cardiff hotels 
also the walls were very thin and i was well aware of every movement of my neighbour 
unlike the hilton across the street which has nice walk-in showers 
executive lounge is great with excellent service and good food and drinks 
we could still hear a fair bit of noise in the early hours ( despite having had a few drinks 
received free wifi access 
and the usual free bar 
) the pool is very nice 
better value for money elsewhere 
200 - 300 meters walk to malioboro . 
the breakfast was decent 
centrally located with lots of restaurants etc within walking distance ( if you can cross the road due 
the hotel staff were very helpful and there was a tour desk in the foyer that was run by 
if you go out of the hotel turn right take the next right and go down about 200 metres on 
i found all aspects of the hotel good and would stay here again for business any time 
breakfast large choice 
the other thing was the decor of the lobby and the rooms 
the restaurant service on the first floor is top notch 
it smelled really bad like someone had thrown up 
floor tiles very clean and even 
the lobby is comfy and the free coffee there is excellent 
price is very reasonable for what you get 
we got free wifi 
roof top pool is very good 
if you book a room with cityview you enjoy the view into a businessoffice - therefore the rooms 
i asked the front desk if they would just please check me in instead of sending me to the lounge 
you can see the saigon river cruise fancy boats passing by 
breakfast was excellent to with a huge buffet all piping hot and massive choice off cooked options and cere 
had view of the outdoor pool just outside my window 
execellent hyatt hotel when maimi hyatt hotel is full . 
quiet rooms 
the resort is beach front set in a very pleasant garden layout and is isolated from any multistore 
not natural ) and property is tired and worn out 
you can tell that its due a refurb - the elevators are old 
the lagoon area is also very special with all it has to offer 
parking was relatively easy to find in town if you are prepared to walk a little while 
huge area 
fab shower and lovely toiletries 
i booked a taxi and the taxi driver paid the bell boy 's 'commission' in front 
great resort with some nice extras for lagoon rooms 
however , the hotel is surrounded by gardens and gardens . 
we paid the extra and used the spa only once 
our apartment ( no 24 ) had an amazing view over the snow clad mountains 
our bed was very comfortable and we wished we could have stayed longer but the weather was not cooperating 
ambience - quiet hotel midst of vibrant street life 
so this was the perfect hotel in tokyo as tokyo station is a major rail hub 
room service menu has no decent food on it and breakfast is a joke -- tried japanese breakfast 
with an amazing staircase that you must use instead of the lift 
room with a great view and most importantly , very quiet even with the air con on high . 
the rooms were very spacious and clean 
much better value for f&b is to go to the oazo building next door which has some 
one of the best hotels that i will never forget 
the bathroom had a 'wet room' style walk in shower which was nice 
a large modern hotel complex located less than 1 minute from the sea-front 
the hotel is well located for restaurants and two supermarkets but the hop on hop off bus stop is about 
we had a very fast internet service that worked consistently 
i had been prewarned about parking charge rip off so i decided to park close to the hotel 
the good news is the decor is nice - the rooms were nicely renovated and the new bar and restaurant 
interesting house with old style and nice furniture 
consider pre purchase for best rate and check what inclusions you have ie full breakafst 
reasonable location 
we had a new room which was very nice 
great just in the process of changing over to a crowne plaza and some building works on going . 
it gave it an extra dimension 
) ready for our early flight 
accommodating front desk for our late check out needs and very informative about local transport during our 
the hotel has all amenities and very nice restaurants ( per tripadvisor ) although we did not try 
there is a good shuttle bus from the airport which costs 2 
plenty of food choices nearby for dinner if you do n't eat at the hotel 
the location is excellent if you want to be close to the station for day trips or just for arriving 
fresh juice 
the service commitment to the customer is at the upper end in the 5 star resort segment 
the pool was nice too 
you can avoid jb town completely if you want to by just using the highway network 
other attractions nearby including johor premium outlets 
but i think you can go to newer and nicer resorts now for the same price 
the banyan tree group of hotels has an excellent reputation already and therefore you arrive with high expectations 
unless you call a hotel with a swimming pool located beside a golf course a resort 
back to the villa - the bed is at floor level so getting up was a chore ( considering 
it was originally a nice touch 
this resort is very beautiful 
the hotel is very close from the airport ( though you do n't hear the planes ) and is 
enjoyed the overall resort-like feel and large open spaces to wander around 
the general manager telephoned our room and asked me what the problems were 
front desk staff were helpful 
hotel is low rise and occupies a large area 
the whole trip was very cheap and the hilton made it magical 
but when you walk out you see the back of business district ugly 
the rooms are dated 
my room was small and dark 
some things are definitely dated and the pool is probably the biggest weakness of the whole place 
the pool area was nice 
one of my gripes against the hilton brand is that they charge for internet services while other hotel 
rooms need updating but are large and beds very comfortable 
especially relative to cost 
you can literally hear each step of the guest in the floor above 
right outside the hotel are many many tapa bars full of life 
you do need to call the front desk to have them change the temp 
the main bathroom was large and had an excellent shower 
ncheap mini bar 
set in the narrow cobalt street near the majestic cathedral 
i booked a double room for 89 and had a rollaway bed put into the room for my mate 
stayed 1 night at this well located ( 5 min- walk to harbour ) middle class hotel 
super nice rooms with a big desk and small refrigerator great showers and a nice restaurant and bar 
toiletries are plentiful and of good quality 
breakfast buffet was fine 22 - good selection of fruits 
there was an issue with the air con though was it was making loud noises from time to time throughout 
shame on you for your terrible customer service 
constant supply of lychee fruit . 
lots of fresh towels and a little storage space 
and 2 times in person at the front desk 
good airport hotel with nice standard sized rooms 
free shuttle bus between airport and hotel runs 24h 
but would i be willing to take a corner suite and they would bring in an extra bed 
i do miss the cool towel and juice upon arrival 
public areas were not overly clean and pool is very small 
i really wish i could give this hotel a better review because there are nice things about it 
yes it is noisy but when you are this close to airport you have to expect that and yes 
nice lobby and clean room 
we went for a tower ocean room and was a tad disappointed at the small size of the room 
like breakfast and everything drinks and food 
food was average and you have to pay for drinks- never experienced that before 
affordable airport hotel near san francisco or you are working in the bay area 
great airport hotel near in-n-out 
wifi was free 
but coffee was free and good 
i stay at westin next door regularly and it is quiet 
what more do you want from an airport hotel 
very good lighting for reading and writing 
i had a large room 
the hotel staff were very helpful 
breakfast buffet was good 
bathrooms are modern and lighting is great 
the rooms very comfortable and fairly spacious 
roof top pool was also nice 
great reception staff 
the only negatives with the room was the windows are heavily tinted so they are quite dark even with 
for couples used to larger beds this could be a problem 
the hotel location is not the best but they do offer a shuttle service to the nearest metro station 
check in and then go off to park in the subsidised car park just around the corner 
rooms are of a good size and so was the wash area 
furnished to good quality 
my problem with the park hyatt is the absurdity of their top floor reception . 
walking distance to the silk market and a short cab ride to the forbidden city 
aside from the view ( we did n't stay there for the view ) overall pleasant experience 
everything just went extremely smoothly and service was top notch 
i would stay again should i have the opportunity to return to kyoto . 
staff at the cafe and reception are very friendly and helpful 
it would help if the building had a hyatt sign on it 
checked in and back down to our room on the 47th floor in double quick time 
the hotel is also across the street from the world trace center mall which features plenty of stores and restaurants 
we enjoyed our daily breakfast at the top floor and the food quality are perfect 
and the third had to be navigated in on my cellphone by the hotel reception 
reasonably-priced ) italian restaurant and the nearest subway station is about 10 minutes walk away 
also a very nice bar 
-- the in-room safe has an internal power outlet so you can charge your accessories while they are 
which was easy to guide taxi to 
pick a room with a non connecting door 
but with the small size of the rooms you do feel like everything is very enclosed 
this hotel is located outside of the city center of kyoto 
they could have had a separate shower rather than the stand-in-bath affair 
there is a very nice bar and place to grab food and the quality and size was worth the price 
the beds are large and comfortable 
there were a few major shrines and temples located nearby as well and a nice row of shops within 
our room on the 4th hhonours floor was clean 
walk a little farther to trinity college 
the homemade bread and the croissants were warm and to die for 
if you are a bad sleeping person ask for a room on the opposite side of the reconstruction 
the italian on second floor and the lower floor restaurant were not as good 
there is a sanju san gen do temple right next to the hotel which is definitely a visit 
we were given a room on the 20th floor with a fantastic view of the city 
you get asked at check in whether you want breakfast and if you do n't choose at this point 
i worked out at their in house fitness center which is a fantastic experience with the view of the city 
the only slight issue is that it is a bit of an open bathroom concept so 
it is a little pricey though 
the hotel is cheaper than staying in central zurich and that is a plus because if you are 
right opposite is a shopping mall though not really worth a visit 
this was the case on our first visit 
service for food and drinks was very slow 
great historic building tastefully restored and turned into an excellent hotel 
it 's an expensive all you can eat and drink buffet but was getting very good local expat 
i had a room in one of the new buildings and it was bright 
and a peaceful sanctuary amid the noise and chaos of kathmandu with resident dogs and gorgeous gardens 
reclaimed wood from old nepali buildings were rescued by the dwarikas and put to use in 
a suite was huge and beautiful 
the restaurants are excellent 
an amazing hotel - the best in nepal 
the only criticism is that the internet was very slow 
the service at this property was amazing 
all the good reviews and compliments she received are right on the mark 
adjacent to the main shopping area and just a short walk ( 10-15 minutes ) to attractions 
2 ) very very good customer service 
clean and spacious 
overall it 's a quiet property despite some construction work going on over the road ( august 
el mapu hotel is a very very busy hotel - absolutely packed with visitors to machu pich 
this hotel is centrally located in machu picchu 
being about 15 minutes from the airport means the free hotel shuttle is welcome but there is a caveat 
this is a very average mercure property 
breakfast was chaotic with hordes of tour groups filling the space completely 
rooms were on the small side but good and the powerful shower was much appreciated as was the efficient radiator 
it was a good hotel 
higher floors have better views 
she grudgingly gave us a drinks voucher 
located by the lake and next to a pedestrian street of restaurants we found walking around rotorua easy 
the room is comfortable and quite large for this type of hotel and parking is free for hotel guests 
breakfast buffet had a nice spread with plenty of western and asian choices 
next to the lake and right near some nice restaurants in town 
the room was also as you would expect from a novotel however some parts of the 
there is a spacious and comfortable lounge with bar and optional outside seating 
there are heaps of restaurants within a 10 minute flat walk and a great convenience store within about 100 
we arrived at the wee hours of the morning and even at that time , construction was in full 
the hotel also has a nice pool area 
room was beautiful and functional 
the california grill on the top floor is excellent ( but costly ) 
the room is clean and bed comfortable 
which was thankfully not overstuffed with mini bar items 
the double basins in the bathroom was huge and not practical 
our room was like any other novotel room 
when we were there the cafe street was made into an outdoor eating area 
but . 
the lobby is nice but the room and the corridores were tired - specially the carpets were dirty 
sufficient free parking space available next to the hotel 
they clean the room and leave used spoons where they were 
great location and good guest facilities representing good value for money 
bars and great resturaunts 
but slightly impersonal . 
provides free wifi 
has a supermarket and a bunch of korean restaurants in the small shopping mall below 
from the over-sized bathroom with separate shower and large bathtub to the over-sized flat- 
which is really neat and definitely worth a visit 
there was easy access from airport 
it is situated at gongdeok metro and train station but but not such a short walk to 
providing some good shopping for local products 
- shower although lovely & large is very slippery and unsafe 
deck is great if it is open and not being used for a private function 
the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had all the little luxuries 
the closest station on the blue airport train line is state lake which is about a 5 minute walk from 
etc ) but it certainly lacks the ability to make you feel like a special customer 
the garden near the entrance beautifully complemented the lobby and the surroundings in what is probably the ober 
we did three jeep safari and saw the tiger for fewer than two times 
it is very crowded at this hotel 
the free breakfast was a nice touch and the roof top restaurant offers fantastic views 
great location for a pre flight overnight stay 
there was also a sofa which was great for spreading all your stuff out 
the level of hospitality is high and probably match some of the good 4 hotel 
to access the floors with the bedrooms on you need to use the lift 
we questioned them about this and after 15 minutes called us back that we would be entitled to a free 
check in desk is on the first floor and was very very busy but they have several check in counters 
bath and shower and great toiletries from peterthomasroth 
this was my first stay at any premier inn 
-bath room amenities like for ex 
good services and amenities 
three minutes walk from hotel entrance to flight check in desk 
the walk is flat and relatively sheltered from rain and we were able to take a baggage trolley straight 
their fine dine restaurant and it was probably one of the best i have had in a long long 
this property was beautiful 
we had a nice dinner there and service was good 
definitely one of the best hotels in the world 
palace location is bit far from city . 
in a national park 
this was one blemish on the otherwise great visit to taj falaknuma palace hotel 
there are many steps around this property to get to the spa or the pool which could be a critical 
the hotel has good amenities -room service 
you know what it 's like when you are tired , been travelling , just need to get to 
very beautiful hotel 
great pillows 
good size rooms 
at most other times the cost is well prices but at 240 euro a night during my stay i found 
location beside convention centre nice hotel with good service located close to cbd and perfect for the convention centre 
there are several restaurants and a starbucks in the area 
with a nice clean bathroom that had a great shower 
great food options at the hotel and nearby and the best gym of any hotel i have stayed anywhere on 
hotel facilities are great 
shopping mall full with good restaurants 
also the bar scene downstairs was great and the food was good 
lots of electrical outlets 
it is connected to a nice shopping center with great stores and restaurants 
i just found my table empty when i just wanted an extra pastry 
the bathroom is large 
the air conditioning was most efficient and the staff were friendly and helpful 
food was buffet style and of a good choice and quality 
hangzhou is an easy weekend getaway - and i 've been hankering after staying at 
rooms are really spacious and good bedding

the bar pool areas were very nice and drink prices seemed reasonable 
only the big open-air pool area is smoking-prohibited

staying at the best suite in this property the presidential suite

wifi is great 
this resort is located at a small hill type elevated rock facing sea 
the bad points are that the place is spread out and you need buggies to a lot of it

very good business hotel 
the very best indian restaurant in the uae 
just book a couple of nights and then look around and if you find somewhere you want to stay you 
spacious for them to play but still good work space if you need to do some business while they 
we were upgraded to a one bedroom apartment on check-in - which was a lovely treat 
the amenities are good ( pool 
great food and drinks 
expect a full size bed and a shower barely large enough to turn around in 
replenishment of toiletries haphazard 
the bed is super comfy and fluffy 
the price was good for london 
situated on a very quiet street 
close to underground ( if one does not feel like walking ) 
that said i got a warm welcome and a free drink 
but overall a good stay and if you need a place to sleep only 
request a fan from the front desk 
there was a bit of late night street noise but i guess that is part of staying right in the 
very comfortable bedvery spacious room ( two room suite ) very fast internet with 1 gb per day 
modern and comfortable and in a perfect location 
but do n't be surprised if it hits 80 nzd dollars one way 
the restaurants are excellent ( and surprisingly reasonable cost wise ) and staff ultra friendly and helpful 
a really funky place to stay in havana 
the restaurants are good 
our room was clean and our bed was very comfortable 
it 's a communist country that offers hospitality the best way they can 
the accommodation is spacious and very well located in launceston 
salon and a good variety of bars which make great cocktails but are overpriced 
good location near the city centre with an excellent restaurant and 24 hour staffed reception 
food was good in the buffet 
beds were clean and comfortable and there was new carpets 
and several restaurants for every taste bud are nearby 
the pool is wonderful as well as the spa 
chinese and healthy options 
as is the large swimming pool 
it 's built within the grounds and my room has a balcony that is private to admire the view 
you walk through a beautiful courtyard garden with fountains into the amazing lobby of the hotel 
the hotel is very modern yet tries to be a historical hotel 
compared with other hotels ive been lucky enough to stay in 
and the gardens and pool area are beautiful 
room quality is at the four seasons standard level- without any complain 
perhaps the only thing to consider is that the resort is about 2 miles from town 
big and with great bathrooms 
if you are looking for a very relaxing place after your shopping day at suck 
this is one of the best hotels and great rooms 
and from two huge terraces 
lovely heated pools 
we thought often of the protective attention of the amarvilas team and the aesthetic care of the 
it 's a beautiful resort 
the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful to us 
the pool is magnificent and just looking over the balcony you would see the pool 
made every aspect of our stay enjoyable 
our linen and pillows did n't smell good either 
i had decided to stay 2 nights in this hotel rather than the other recommended newly remodelled small hotels 
our meal here was memorable and great value for money 
being at the back of the hotel complex ( sofitel and 1 other are in this complex ) 
close by is the canton palace restaurant which offers good chinese food and is recommended 
terra-cotta warriors - book a taxi to take you there and back 
as xian is a historic city 
although it also still deserves an excellent rating 
the property itself is beautiful and the rooms were very comfortable 
the hotel had a lot of non-chinese guests 
high floor rooms with balconies are worth the additional cost 
this was my first trip to adelaide and i was there on business 
we were only staying for a couple of days so decided to stay with our booked room to enjoy its 
what annoyed me the most was the drunken idiots coming out of the bar located within the same building as 
good living area but the bedroom was very small not much room between the bed and wardrobe 
the apartments are modern tastefully decorated and quality bedding make for a most relaxing and satisfying stay 
nice swimming pool and a free golf cart ride to the taj mahal 
the space was also fit for purpose and the bed comfortable 
how friendly the staff were and to have a nice view of taj mahal made it so more 
the hotel rooms are extremely comfortable and breakfast is impeccable 
complimentary minibar and free high speed wifi 
the excellent staff providing top class service is wonderful 
rooms and bathrooms are big and extremely spacious 
the staff and the taj 
pool and the location it self worth the money 
new hotel with nicely decorated rooms with high end materials and hardware 
it is also close to several stores along the road outside the malls 
room was nice and very good size 
just another beach front resort 
the resort is absolutely fantastic 
the next door shopping has all you need 
follow for quite a while until you come to bug crossing with traffic lights ( first traffic lights are really 
the bathroom was of a good size 
the parking is free for hotel guests and a flat rm10 for diners 
the buffet breakfast was unbelivable everything imagineable as was the room service 
stay for sure 
but it 's just not 100 top notch 
the lay-out of the suite was perfect and everything was in perfect order 
free mini bar of softdrinks and beer 
we also made the most of evening drinks in the lounge which was great 
fantastic lobby . 
bed & bedding very good quality and a large 42 screen at the bottom of the bed & no 
staffs are friendly and polite 
cheap parking and everything you need in a beautifully presented package 
friendly and helpful staffcons 
the staff are very attentive and the room is very comfortable 
basic etiquette needs to be taught such as in the buffet they wait for the guest to walk past not 
my room had no windows which was absolutely fine as all i wanted to do was sleep . 
the location is great as there is a very high end shopping mall opposite and if you go out of 
i must make a special mention to the well equipped gym and the sauna was very nice 
the bed is fantastic although a little too short for those over 6foot 
bed is nice 
centrally located this is a good hotel 
the room itself was very adequate 
it has been more than 8 years since my last stay and surprisingly there still have my record 
dry cleaning ironing 
helpful and efficient front desk service 
the breakfast is one of the best with good quality spread 
a mix of international cuisine and restaurant is large enough to spread out the crowd 
we felt like we were at a self service hotel instead of a full service hotel 
the lounge in the hotel is nice as well and has plenty of room to conduct meetings 
with the heavenly bed 
convenient for shopping but over all slightly above average 
good egg station and very nice fresh pressed juices 
but i could tell the carpet was very dirty and probably had not been vacuumed or cleaned for a 
a very good business hotel located right across the street from a very sophisticaed mall with a food republic 
the club lounge is very big and spacious 
breakfast is very good with a choice of western and eastern cuisine 
the only things that we really liked were the things that were cooked fresh for you - the dum 
i was glad i booked the package as it made sightseeing easier and the hotel staff checked with us 
i expect much more from a hotel that calls itself shangri-la 
executive rooms are on the top floors and have better views of the city 
the rooftop bar has a nice happy hour every day 
busy streets 
there is lots of shopping nearby and restaurants 
breakfast was ok but the staff were a bit slow in clearing tables outside 
quite warm with the airconditioning not quite doing its job 
probably to be expected from such a property but very efficient - and appreciated 
wifi worked effectively and appreciated the extensive television options room service was very efficient and good quality -- actually 
it ment that parts of the bar was closed for guests attending the festival 
room was pleasant and good 
bed is very comfortable 
also actually very good value at 90 considering my last holiday inn was 10 cheaper and grot pit 
several restaurants 
so this is not really an airport hotel 
amazing value 
service was great and the rooms very nice and comfortable 
in my last review 
each and every hotel staff has been pleasant 
overall a very good resort very big 
the only way to keep the rooms at a tolerable temperature is to keep the blinds closed from 
i may have to bring my travel black out blinds in the future when we go back 
good location if you travel and have to catch an early flight 
i would definitely stay here again 
good airport hotel 
the internet pricing is also ridiculous 
was about 30 minutes by road to the main old town royal way area of warsaw 
this resort is very very family friendly and the staff were all very nice - rooms were a good size 
when you 're tired from a flight 
typical mantra hotel no complaints here - nice hotel for the business traveller . 
it 's on the beach and has some excellent cane furniture 
swimming pool is really small ( and very cold ) 
because of the nature preserve the area is loaded with fish 
always had to wait for one 
stayed at the club room and they offered very good services at their lounge 
no free internet 
bathroom lovely and clean and very modern 
set in the financial district 
this resort has a few restaurants and a nice lobby bar 
my room was on the 4th floor and a bit noisy but it is a city hotel 
one of the best relaxed family hotels in the world 
recently every year we have stayed at shangri-la mactan for a short vacation 
massive buffet 
the staff was friendly and proactive 
this a huge resort and bit scary when you come first time 
1 prices in the hotel have risen sharply in the last 3 years2 had dinner at tides buffet 2500 
the ocean club had a great spread for evening cocktails 
on the ground floor the bar serves up good drinks 
however some of the restaurant staff are a little abrupt and unfriendly 
the staff from the van driver to the check-in staff was etc was great . 
but the 10 credit at the starbucks branded coffee shop was nice 
the airport and railway is interchangeable and very useful for transfer from the hotel in center city in 30 minutes 
3 minutes walk from central train station and airport bus ( which terminates at the central station ) 
very close to the airport 
so much variety and great quality 
brilliant air port shuttle service and better still the airport train into the city centre 
room was clean and nicely decorated 
great location right next to the main eating spots in town 
and a very comfortable queen size bed 
great location right by train station which is airport express bus final stop and city center 
we stayed at the regent because it was ranked number 1 and based on the reviews expected something special 
in the smaller bedroom the space for clothes is a bit limited 
and within very easy walking distance of the lake and the main eating area in rotorua 
we only stayed at this hotel for one night 
the quality of the beds and furnishings are very good 
wine and drinks available but bright lights 
we were allocated room 136 in aspen lodge which had 2 double beds 
the concierge lounge is also pretty good 
no mini bar 
the rooftop bar has stunning views and is worth visiting even if you do n't stay here 
- in general a good hotel but no five stars 
nice gym with free apples and ear buds 
good value at c 21 ) 
rooms a good size and well laid out 
the rooms were clean and nice and reception was professional 
the front desk did n't know and had to ask someone else 
i come to this hotel regularly because i value the excellent service and friendly staff 
you are within walking distance to several restaurants with great choices all around 
my first time staying at this location 
the restaurants are lovely and apart from the small 
my tooth brush worth cny 1200 
ask for a room with an outside window -- but be prepared to see a parking lot if you are 
the bathroom was great 
but for early evening cocktails and nibbles the lounge is great 
bed was firm and very comfortable 
nice toiletries 
club lounge had cocktails wine food soft drinks all day and night and great breakfasts plus great views 
guest rooms are ample in size and very well set-out - which really makes them feel a 
clean and comfortable- the staff is extremely nice & friendly - not too many food options and the hotel 
i was working just around the corner so it suited me very well location-wise 
the hotel had a frequent shuttle bus services to the airport so it 's reasonably handy for getting to 
free shuttle service and great breakfast 
stayed one night and took an early morning shuttle bus to the terminal ( drive less than 5 min 
excellent layover for catching early flight the next day 
free wifi that does not require daily logging in 
the front desk said they would chase up 
perfect for early departure 
with hot and cold options alike 
the guest rooms are small but the housekeeping standards are high 
good property 
the beds and pillows are excellent and the ac works great 
be aware that this is a huge resort and some of the rooms are a considerable walk from the restaurants 
the area is also good and local 
were given complimentary bikes last time and spent a leisurely hour peddling around the lagoon and out 
there is a big lobby and check in is pretty efficient 
they are all easily and quickly accessible by mtr 
it was fairly busy at the resort while we were there but we only ever had to wait for the 
the buffet breakfast is quite good in terms of quality and choices 
our room was cold - the air conditioning could not be changed 
rather than each building being clearly marked with the range of room numbers 
mini bar was non existent and the television did not work ( again 
if you can get the right price including the breakfast buffet and if your stay is just a day or 
the hotel is conveniently close to the metro 
the facilities are good for both but if you are looking for a quiet place to stay 
which for public transport gives you only the name of a private train line station but no jr and 
a great spa 
the bed was too firm for my liking 
would definately recommend this well priced hotel 
location of the hotel is great with airport limousine bus just next to the hotel and also the 
1 ) to and from airport shuttle from kansai airport for 2800 yen for rt or 
for a big city 
our mini suite was spacious 
has airport direct shuttle bus service 
4 stars ( near to namba area and next to a subway line 
soft comforter but the pillow were too soft and flat for me 
had wonderful check in with guest service manager 
the hotel is located adjacent to the airport 
the villas are huge and have 2 and 3 bedroom villa 's if your family is too 
the entire structure is pretty new and staff is nice and polite 
- public taxi to lamai is about 800 thb and takes about 25 minutes 
it is not a resort you can really just walk around 
a spacious floor plan with a kitchen and really large bathroom which was equipped with two sinks and a massive 
the views were quite good from the higher floors as well 
the resort had a little parade and some activities which was quite cute 
despite the nice setting and the luxury atmosphere of the six senses 
and dinner very good 
it is excellent in every way but could be in any big city 
we definitely recommend the place . 
since this is very large resort 
it was my first time staying at a mariott hotel and i must say i was a bit diss 
you are gluten free we have special bread for you 
i had meatballs for lunch and they were delicious 
all in all absolutely great value for money 
only negative comment was the wifi was slow and did n't work well 
pool area is very nice 
what bothered me werea ) the tv cabinet in the living room was missing the tv insideb ) 
plus reception were really helpful in organizing onward flights 
lovely resort close to the old town 
9 & 13 ) in the room without the pool and stayed in the one with 
therefore poor value 
i really wanted to give the aubrey the highest rating possible 
comfortable bed with lovely crispy ( in a good way 
some people recommend the front row of suites 
as an introduction to our first hotel in this continent we instantly realised what a good choice we had made 
we went down to the front desk to enquire as to the whereabouts of the taxi 
just one little table in the middle of the breakfast room 
i had a private terrace where it was lovely to relax and watch the bellavista goings 
instead of having the sinks next to each other 
with ploenchit bts being the closest station 
the decor and service were very good 
but the bed was hard and the not comfortable 
breakfast is served in a huge area with all kind of selections from indian via asian to 
i did however visit others in rainforest rooms which were completely private and had a great outlook 
our 1 bedroom apartment was spacious and very clean with a large balcony facing the rainforest 
who took care of our every need and gave us great options our time here in chennai 
the rude manager was completely inappropriate 
excellent accommodation located in a great location just outside of the main town 
stayed here recently for a conference and was highly impressed by this hotel starting with helpful and friendly reception 
efficient staff - would stay again 
but they give guests free passes to an excellent gym about a mile away on california street 
fluffy towels 
there is plenty of free parking if you are driving and the pool looked small 
we like staying here and will no doubt stay here again soon 
and i get massages weekly at home 
sarah at the front desk said they are happy to store it for a few hours at no charge 
the ambiance great 
comfortable and convenient we stayed 1 night as part of a business trip , the hotel is not too 
depending on the rate you pay this is pretty good 70 b&b for a good standard hotel like 
but it is city centre and the rooms were only double or twin and no baths 
all staff seemed very pleasant and efficient 
nicely decorated and very comfortable 
although the decor was very dated and the room was on the small side it looked out to the larg 
quirky lighting and general appearance 
you get better hotel at less price 
the rooms were large 
the helpful front desk staff 
concierge lounge had appropriate food 
i wanted somewhere that was handy for transport as well as good value 
the beach is lovely 
service was fantastic at the puri bar with fabulous 2 for 1 cocktails only metres from the sea 
the plunge pool is about 4m x 4m with decking and loungers for 4 people 
attentive service and good recommendations for sight seeing 
the private butler is there to tend to all your needs and can organise almost any thing you need 
there 's also a charming roof top bar 
overlooking the pool is always delightful 
one morning we had massages and their commentary bbq lunch ( delicious ) when we returned to 
but large bathroom 
there was a jacuzzi in one corner of the room as well 
the bathroom is pretty small and the shower is only separated from the rest of the bathroom by a shower 
as soon as we arrived we were made to feel welcome everything was explained over a cool welcome drink and 
welcome drinks and snacks upon arrival at the hotel 
i tried the spa for a massage and the quality of the service was very good as well 
they know you by name and there were hardly any request that was n't granted . 
we enjoyed having dinner next to the river in a cocoon at kubu 
great concierge service and great bfast 
the lebua seems cursed with some of the slowest elevators i 've ever used 
the spa is good 
room was lovely - clean and spacious 
unfortunately during the check-in i was informed there were only rooms for smokers available 
the coffee shop has an excellent breakfast 
lounge access was done on the first floor and renovations were ongoing 
the food is good and the evening buffet is excellent value 
right off the beach but not close enough to good beaches 
there are many hype spots and different areas designated for specific clientel 
amazing view and quiet location 
close to the river and old town 
take extra coat hangers for trousers 
but with a good air conditioning and complimentary wi-fi 
overall it is a good value hotel in quite a resonable position in oslo 
copacabana beach just across the street and many of rio 's finest restaurants are short 
had a small room with no outside facing window 
had probably the best bed i have ever slept in 
super close to airport - easy to get there 
the hotel does offer a free shuttle to downtown sf which is a very handy feature ( and let 
it is also a pleasant walk of about a mile to reach the marina mall 
very nicely located in the new jumerah area 
instead parked next door for 13 
rooms - good space 
like a hot bath 
the grounds are manicured and pristine and the pool perfect for children and adults alike 
good sized bathroom and very nice sheets and towels 
offering a wide selection of daily-changing dishes 
the bed was very comfortable 
room was a good size with part view of the hollywood sign 
when i chose this hotel on the internet i was uncertain what to expect but i was so happy with 
use the adjacent parking lot and save some 
very nice hotel great location 
honestly it felt more like small 5 star boutique hotel 
my room on the 17th floor had a fantastic view of both the hollywood sign and also downtown 
60 eur each way it 's worth the trip 
but luang prabang is about exploring the temples and the restaurants 
double sinks and the separate shower room 
luang prabang is a lovely town and so wonderful to relax in 
the bed was very comfortable and all drinks were complimentary in the mini bar 
given how expensive this property is 
or the option of using one of their readily available hotel bicycles 
the hotel sits one end of luang prabang 
definitely go for a second floor room - these offer great views over the mekong 
wifi is only free in the lobby 
we had sent an email to the hotel advising of an early arrival and the hotel was very accommodating to 
unbelievable location for an exceptional hotel 
the accompanying sparkling wine champagne was just the perfect end to our time in italy . 
the rooms were fine and the employees are pleasant enough even though there could be many more of them at 
meats ( both cold and hot ) pastries 
some of its rooms were renovated and the finishing touches were very good but still are very noisy specially in 
the pool is a disappointment as1 
the rooms are cozy with lots of thoughtful touches and the location cannot be beat 
it is worth it with the food and drinks you can enjoy 
we arrived from berlin late in the evening and were quite tired and just wanted to eat and sleep 
i recommend you stay in the city and get up an hour earlier . 
it really ca n't be beaten for convenience so as long as you accept the utilitarian aspects of an 
maybe a little bit better table maintenance would be appreciated 
it was a very large buffet that started serving very early to accommodate early flights 
the shuttle is a really good service 
the evening reception and breakfast in the executive lounge were also great 
good independent air con and a good sized bathroom with a shower over a bath 
the lobby very spacious with a big lounge which is great for meetings2 ) the set up of the 
internet is free only in the public space and only at pre-2000 dial up speeds - anything of 
it is a nice size 
hot items 
but the club room is a nice perk if you 're likely to eat on premises 
free internet 
near good restaurants 
the rooms were exceptionally tastefully decorated in calming tones and good bathroom amenities 
check in was great and the clerk utterly charming and helpful 
breakfast was very good quality and staff helpful 
europe 's worst airport hotel 
very average airport hotel 
there is free wi-fi in the public areas 
you can walk to your early flight in the morning 
a great nights sleep 
on hold to the front desk i ordered a club sandwhich for 20euros 
its a short walk to everything you need- beach 
valet parking is convenient but a bit expensive 
good location for city centre 
also wifi is free but only for a while 
as there 's a good selection of bars and restaurants in a lovely marina 
- friendly & helpful staff at receptioncons 
very small bathroom & toilet but rest of room was a good size 
otherwise it is a very new hotel located close to the night markets and convenient for visits to the 
pool was not a plunge pool and one you could actually swim in 
the staff were friendly and helpful 
very beautiful decor 
we had several service issues 
resort so nice and rooms amazing 
dive in off the street after doing 1000 's of mopeds and you walk into an inner 
i almost always write great reviews so this hotel was disappointing 
the service was incredible and the breakfast buffet was great 
but they still managed to stay on top on quality and originality by far 
the rooms were beautiful and comfortable and the food was very very good 
free wifi and a nice view 
plenty of storage and excellent and controllable lighting 
the bath alone was the size of a small hotel room 
the suite was extremely comfortable and peaceful and included a balcony with great city views 
rooms are top notch 
mainly due to location 
and the club lounge is a victim of its own success 
a very nice hotel 
food options are good at the lounge though 
hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to from el dorado airport 
smaller club lounge 
i have paid a lot of money to be in this hotel and they want me to pay 7 
modern bathroom 
close to the airport and the t and g-zone 
restaurants and if you 're eligible or purchase access to the westin club 
the breakfast buffet was good on choices and freshness 
while having a great view and very pleasant decor 
lobby is located on the second floor 
the spread was impressive but the food is quite substandard 
overall good hotel 
big bathroom with separate rain shower room with nice bathtub and a walk in closet 
only one large towel was provided for a 2 occupancy room 
adjacent to hotel is wuyi square with a big hypermarket da yun fa and lots 
i like the hotel and will consider staying there again for my next trip to kl-- mainly for 
a decent , solid regular non-boutique hotel this is a good choice if you 're 
early park entry 
it has a range of food and beverage options and helpful staff 
the toiletries were good but standard 
room was okay - not luxury but for what we paid it is reasonable 
the rooms and public areas are spacious and the views of the harbour are stunning 
on rainy days they even lined up towels for guests at the hotel entrance 
the rooms were very nicely appointed & spacious - some with nice water views 
the room was nicely decorated and clean 
showers a little disappointing 
the ability to take the water taxi to from the park in less than 5 minutes was huge 
the swimming pool is huge but and difficult to keep an eye on younger children 
their concierge was especially helpful 
quick walk over to citywalk and the parks 
the royal pacific report is a beautifully decorated resort 
we rented a cabana for the day and it was stocked with all kinds of drinks and fresh fruit 
with the exception of the receptionists and the front office manager purser 
it was good value 
had breakfast here with my niece- the price of the hot buffet breakfast is a bit over the top 
many nearby restaurants 
lovely bathroom but lacked extras you 'd expect for the price like hot chocolate 
we spent 2 nights here last week 
nice shower and very clean 
the walls are solid to block out all the sounds when inside the rooms 
fine modern hotel with great views and central location 
the hotel has quite a good ambiance and the views are fantastic 
at first we thought the pillows were too soft too but later found out that they have a pillow 
the trump is a wonderful hotel but is sterile 
the living area huge ( two pull out beds ) 
a complete package right here in heart of waikiki 
there is a pillow menu so you can sleep more comfortably and the air conditioning worked well 
the rooms are super clean and nice 
and a choice of hot and cold options 
there is no full on spa available 
the room was large and so convenient having a kitchen 
we had a deluxe studio suite which had all the amenities you require 
anyway the rest of the stay was very good 
breakfast menu spread very limited 
the pool is small and there is 
but not good value 
easy walk to everywhere 
we enjoyed the infinity pool and the views of the sunset from the many outdoor spaces available 
the bed was very comfortable 
you take a lift from the ground floor to the 6th where the lobby is located 
there is a fair bit of free parking at the hotel and we had no trouble in getting a space 
it would be more efficient to have guests check-in the same process as the hotel offers for check 
with the all amenities you could want 
i ordered a light snack at the bar on my first evening there 
rooms are all on high floors in a office building which is about 500 metres to toranomon subway 
how can i not be touched of this kind service 
the room is not very new but pass my standard as a comfortable resting place after a day of hard 
only 2 big pillows on the bed 
my son and i enjoyed the pool very much 
no separate shower 
the lobby is on the 50th floor and the rooms are on floors 47-50 
the breakfast buffet had an excellent assortment of dishes 
fast wifi and coffee tea maker 
unique architecture- grand lobby- cordial service from all staff members- very nice room and bathroom- 
elvis is a great concierge 
the suite meant i had access to the fantastic grand club on the fifth floor - free breakfast ( with 
the rest of our stay was less then impressive 
breakfast offers continental and asian choices and the butter chinese noodles really impressed me 
the art house project ( you buy a book of tickets to visit six small houses ) 
shopping and the subways 
upgraded to a suite which was huge with massive windows 
on the first floor and all windows overlooking a small market just across the road 
rooms big and bright - tho you have to pay extra for a bath 
check-in staff and the concierge were all helpful and cheerful 
great shower 
very nice executive lounge 
yet is just a short walk to many local attractions ( e 
this is how good hotels should be 
to the main attractions ( t-square 
there is free wireless in the lobby 
it 's close to the subway 
as good as it gets exceptional service , location and quality at this magnificant hotel ! 
the room is huge and have everything that you need 
the hotel and its executive lounge are great 
access to the lounge are all very nice touches 
excellently located hotel right next to wangfujing road 
executive rooms are located in a separate building with separate entrance 
- executive lounge offers great service and good snacks 
great rooms and service 
it was only a short walk to work as well 
it is located on the eastern side of the city 
with modern bathroom in the room concept 
many small stores 
they have one of the best breakfast 
they have a nice pool and lots of other activity for children during weekends 
there 's free internet in the lobby and all the staff there 
best of all are all the adjacent eateries & shops 
business hotel with good facilities 
was easily able to walk downtown and get a feel for the place 
easy to walk around the city and there is a tram station just outside of the hotel 
you understand that you can go to a hotel which is just behind one of the hotels like hyatt 
the lobby has an open feel to it 
so did not get a chance to try that ( a real disappointment when bringing workout gear for a short 
the front desk totally nasty 
well good luck cos it means a long drive in horrid traffic to go one round again ) breakfast 
just above nice shopping mall with many opportunities to eat and relax 
the hyatt has an amazing location 
choose a low floor as the lifts are always busy 
low standards and older hotels of honolulu i guess the hyatt regency is one of the better 
the room itself was clean and the size is acceptable for a business hotel 
a beautiful property wasted 
you ca n't access the self laundry if you are locate on different floors 
the room design is great from the bed through the lighting and off course the bath room 
this hotel is a nightmare to park 
gym and pool were excellent 
the hilton garden inn is close to the airport and has a convenient shuttle ( airport shuttle in front 
the 4 restaurants are amazing 
whilst all other airport hotels i have used that are far from the airport have dedicated hotel shutt 
do n't stay if you want to sleep 
the rooms are clean but not so big for an american hotel chain 
pool area is beautiful - jimbaran beach likewise 
spent the days sightseeing and the evenings in the local neighborhood 
this sheraton property is modern and sleek 
i wanted to go and pick her up and normally in other 5 star properties they will charge full price 
outstanding proper everywhere and great beds 
in-town location if you are deciding between the palace and the beau rivage , the 
if you are in bali this is one of the best resorts 
the breakfasts were good 
well versed and professional reception team always make me feel welcome 
the beach was clean 
the bar is pleasant and the restaurant serves good food 
he then proceeded to treat me like a complete idiot and argued with me that i had used a debit 
we enjoyed the beach front situated bar 
this is not the front desk fault 
situated on probably the best beach in jimbaran 
ideally located by the beach and with great swimming pools 
the hotel 's lobby is n't exciting and the hotel in general feels stuck in past 
and the i think the hotel allows guests to bring their pooches 
the hotel is well kept and the club rooms are worth the additional investment if you can 
the numerous pools make this resort a class of its own 
i thought it was a very good business hotel in a very convenient location 
the room size is average and the balconies are a bit small 
separate swimming pool and exclusive club caf bar in the charming grounds 
service was good ( ish ) some of the staff were great 
the room was a great size and very clean 
the king rooms and bathrooms were spacious and the bed wonderful after a full day of walking the beautiful city 
food quality excellent 
and some excellent local cheap food options 
it is rather stuffy as we were just entering winter and when we informed the front desk 
the staff were great and allowed us to check in straight away ( they also gave complimentry late check 
the roof top pool was open when we were there as was the bar which has fabulous views - but 
bed so comfortable and sheets silky smooth 
i had two very enjoyable meals at the country kitchen - yum 
hotel staff are incredibly friendly and helpful 
the beds are wonderfully comfortable and ( at least in the one bedroom residences ) there is also a kitchen 
this process will actually debit your credit card and in some other countries 
we got a room upgrade on our gold status to a suite with 2 bedrooms which were spacious and neat 
easy to get taxi 
i rang the reception complaining and they relocated me to 508 
room was also classic and beds were comfortable 
we also found the lounge room of our suite unusable 
sadly a room overlooking the beach was not available but still we spent hardly any time in the 
outside private jacuzzi and shower ( also indoor shower ) together with comfortable lounger chairs 
there were comfortable chairs 
nice room and pool 
we experienced one of the best private tours of canyon negra ( thanks to ana and our driver ) 
there were coffee making facilities in the accommodation which i greatly appreciated in the mornings 
good selection and helpful service and overall very good value in comparison to the raddisson which whilst very 
the worst wifi i have ever had at a hotel anywhere in the world 
room was clean and spacious and bathroom the same 
mine is on the top floor with a spacious bathroom with a double vanity and an oversized king-sized 
we visited all three restaurants and they were all good 
the hilton at man is a typical airport hotel - close by the airport 
location is reasonably convenient - a 10 minute walk from the train station and there 's a free shuttle 
there was a large armchair which doubled as a single sofa bed 
it is very spread out along the beach so quiet 
i have stayed here a few times over the years pre flight . 
the spa was great 
the entire resort is truly mystical 
the room is also a bit on the small size and the facilities look dated 
diane is a great sort on reception and asana is very understanding 
the spa was good about wanting to make it up 
the beach is excellent because there is no nearby development 
comfortable close to the airport and all of the car parks . 
make a reservation at their spa village very early - i did n't get to experience it as their 
staff were helpful 
the shower was of the easy walk in type and bathroom amenities were nice to have 
comfortable bed and good shower amenities 
stuck in a time warp in the 1970s with dreadful tired decor and poor rooms 
rooms are big and new and hotel lobby is superb 
the floor clean 
the many pools of this resort are just beautiful esp 
breakfast is good and suits for international customers 
we found the onsite grocery store sufficient for our need ( snacks 
inclusive package which worked out better for me 
everything you needed was present ( including complimentary drinks and snacks ) with a large tv ( with vod 
overall a really nice neighbourhood to be in 
i asked even the hotel lounge on the top floor and was told this was no different 
where you can purchase alcoholic drinks as well 
there is complimentary coffee tea in the morning and complimentary red white wine after 5 
the hotel has good customer service values and the staff do their best to attend to guests needs 
bedside remote control 
the famous buffet is very popular and worth experiencing 
so after flying 12 hours we arrived at the m o in k . 
i would n't let this experience cloud my overall very favourable impression on this hotel 
i did n't feel comfortable staying in our room 
enjoyed the complimentary internet and the hotel seems to have figured out the earlier problem regarding shortage of 
in case you get tired of the restaurants inside the hotel 
the swimming pool is great though 
but instead facing straight into the carpark of the adjacent building 
the pool is the great attraction for me - good size with a superb sun deck with plenty of lou 
the staff will always seem more run down during this 8 week stretch as this wave of guests brings serious 
location - okay but not as convenient as the other hotels on the main strip of restaurants 
immaculate and generously sized 
really lovely well located hotel 
there was mildew and there was no cotton buds 
and all the facilities were of high standard 
eat by the pool there is a nice view of kl 
the club lounge was great value and well worth the extra money spent 
good location as it is just across from klcc which makes it very convenient for the business traveller 
breakfast spread is decent but not really outstanding in any way 
the wifi was decent 
mandarin oriental delivers as always superb service 
with really comfortable pillows 
the price is right and we were very pleased with our stay 
we were lucky to stay only for 1 night as our room 512 faced the post street opposite jw 
probably would be better off having a fabulous rain shower and removing the tub 
it is expected to have more personal touch and make the stay more memorable 
people were generally pleasant in this huge property 
the hotel is situated right next to the suria klcc which has a reasonable array of restaurants 
i had a great stay 
hotel lobby is very pretty with a lot of tropical plants 
and the only bad thing about the lower floor is the view 
the hotel has heaps of car parking spaces available at the property next door 
the free internet is a good idea but surfing on my mobile is faster 
carpark was full but there was space next door at c2 so all was acceptable on that 
rooms are spacious and clean 
we travelled to kuala lumpur for a family holiday and chose the mandarin oriental primarily for 
example - on arrival the mini-bar had no alcoholic drinks in it 
the train takes you straight there bypassing traffic 
the room is a very good size with a great big king size bed 
beautiful and extremely clean bedrooms 
the marble lobby is so elegant and lots of royal selangor and silver around the hotel 
the breakfast choice was good but again not at the same level as other mandarin hotels i have stayed 
nice pool area 
it 's a place to come for a weekend with your friends - a pricey one though 
pillows ( and hopefully duvet ) as well as the cleanliness roominess of the bathroom and 
the building is very regal looking inside and the check-in was swift and easy 
this hotel was very nice and i would recommend it-- but probably only at the highly discounted rate we 
room is excellent and very comfortable beddings 
great restaurants ( we went to the grill ) 
good bathroom 
i appreciate this place more because i stayed here prior to renovation in the old rooms 
the swimming pool was clean and big 
the rooms were small but well appointed and the balcony was great to have 
the restaraunt is expensive and the food average again- ice eaten worse but also eaten much better 
this hotel feels like a marriott 
it is not entirely easy to find but once you are there you feel like you are in a se 
areas within can be sectioned off with large floor to ceiling sliding wooden doors 
the suite was very pleasant with fans and a c and kitchenette and access to the beach 
the rooms have a kitchen and private balcony large bathroom with bath and shower 
breakfast choice could have been better . 
we really liked the view from our second floor ocean view room 
the pool is small and a mis match of colours 
the people working very hard in the excuitive lounge at 35th floor linda the manager with nice 
the beach at the resort was completely packed with no space between the sunbeds 
they serve an extensive buffet breakfast with western and chinese options and eggs omelets made to order 
and it 's just a few steps away from the famous nanjing east road walkway 
if you have clubcarlson status ( we 're gold and got upgraded to very nice suites 
catching a cab is easy-again cross the road and you can always get a cab 
really excellent setting 
although it is a large resort the staff are outstanding and always find a solution to any issues 
overall good experience and very good value for money 
i has nice dinner there as well 
the big surprise is the fantastic dining room for lunch with stations for every food you can 
driving time to the airport is close to 45 minutes 
although a similar smell could be felt in other parts of the hotel 
big hotel , but never felt crowded , even at breakfast . 
but needs better maintenance 
this hotel is among the best in guangzhou 
fresh juice 
the bar on the top floor had a very nice view but the girls singing made conversation impossible 
in this price range actually unacceptable and there are far better and cheaper alternatives in shanghai 
italian pizza and pasta 
quality and a wide range of cuisinesthis is one of our top 3 5-star hotels 
the bar next to the lobby was great too 
turns out my windows open to a grey wall only a foot away 
check-in is on the 22nd floor and then u travel further down for your room 
friends said the pool was especially nice 
there 's a food court in the mall next to the hotel 
with modern fittings and contemporary decor 
probably one of the best in town 
spent the day relaxing by the pool had dinner prior to going to terminal 1 
is convenient and close to major companies and adjacent to several shopping malls - including malls under construction 
the hotel is close to canton fair ( 10 mins drive ) and to the international airport ( 30 
the bed was exactly what we needed and there is no plane noise 
an excellent airport hotel 
highly recommended hotel within an easy walk of the terminals 
i was first at this hotel in 2006 and pleased to see the level of service stay the same as 
had to love the big long bench in the main room where we could place suitcases 
i stayed at this hotel on a layover before my flight the next morning 
being adjacent to the airport 
broken toilet seat 
which is probably unusual for an airport hotel 
a subway station is located across the street 
we had a very good nights sleep and did n't hear any aircraft noise at all 
corner suites are great 
room service bites menu good and efficient 
adams morgan is great place within a short walking distance 
a superior marriott property ( decor 
and be advised that the wardman tower is a very long hike from the lobby so best to avoid 
the room 's decor was modern and funky 
well-located in dc with easy access to most of the city 
lovely view - large space 
the pool and bbq area were faultless and there was plenty of parking 
there is full sized grocery near by 
i really hope management change this attitude because in my three most recent stays at peppers and two mantra stays 
but very modern and many extras you do n't see at more expensive hotels 
this is the perfect choice for late arrival or very early flight 
the hi-tea and the evening cocktail food is much better than 3yrs ago on my last 
there are many nice cafes and restaurants and the beach surf is just as good 
and thought the convenience justified the extra price 
more than an airport hotel 
food options are fantastic in the lane way between the 2 tower - dinner at social was the highlight 
the beach is across the road and is very clean and quiet most of the time 
ocean view high level tower 1 
recommend that tower 1 is worth the extra cost for the view 
parking is free in a secured section away from the public car park 
it is a good transit hotel but slightly expensive 
the hallways are open to the elements and let me remind you that humidity is extremely high in sing 
it served a decent buffet breakfast but mostly local fare 
rooms were a really good size w awesome bathrooms 
the free shuttle is hard to find and there is no at the airport or on the website 
rooms too are basic but neat and clean with bathrooms being adequately spacious and well laid out 
i just completed two one-night stays here and if i had n't had early flight 
right in the middle of town and minutes walk to some great restaurants and decent pubs 
not only is it an actual airport hotel that is connected directly to terminal 3 ( unlike some other airport 
being so close to the airport 
slept like babies and up first thing with a two minute walk to the sky train and our next 
the walls are dark 
the bed is very comfortable 
a km or two north of the city centre 
you can reach the airport mall really easy from this hotel 
unfortunately everything else seemed to be about being charged extra 
on the down side carparking is a public car park not the hotels and expensive 
we had a twin bed room with no view 
for me- most probably will try other hotels instead next time 
in summary this hotel is perfect if you have a planned layover as you can use all the amenities 
check in was smooth and a free drink was offered as an ihg gold member 
bed excellent and bathroom ( shower and tub ) excellent 
we went down and relaxed by the pool which we found very convenient 
the staffs are amazingly helpful and friendly 
pool area is excellent 
good airport hotel and so convenient 
a taxi arrived at the pre-arranged time to take us to the train station for our next 
this hotel is ultra modern with fantastic facilities 
breakfast was very good and room service excellent 
as good as airport hotels come 
this was an ideal base to visit one of the friendlest 
the pool is fantastic and the standard of overall amenity was really high 
the price for the quality is very good value 
just a nice little walk down to victoria square and the markets or to rundle mall 
would i stay again - yes if the flight arrives so late - we might consider other alternatives if we 
it was absolutely wonderful in terms of comfort and space and we would have like longer to enjoy its 
the bathroom is huge and everything is new 
the best airport for sin overnights 
the property was pretty bad for the price paid 
a nice cabin with an outside area overlooking coles bay and a very pleasant feeling about the whole place 
the lobby is located on the ground floor which was only accessible by lift as the escalator to go 
highly expansive for a very average hotel 
the airport is located right next to the airport operations 
a very good business hotel 
when you factor in the cost of taxi to and from airport to city hotel 
pool outstanding and rooms were decent 
they have a roof top bar which i am told is great in the summer 
i heard a lot of banging and looked outside to see that my room directly overlooked an active noisy construction 
the bar next door was open until when ever 
the official check in time is at 3 
the suite was clean and very well appointed 
nice boutique hotel 
quality rooms nicely finished with all accessories you 'd expect from a 4 star hotel 
the bathroom is rather large with a separate shower and tub 
large spa and fitness facilities 
a shopping mall is attached to the railway station and one can buy supplies there 
the bar in the lobby is empty with no staff 
property is beautiful 
plenty of restaurants 
quirky little touches add to the experience 
i headed over the road to a cafe close by 
excellent food and a good wine list 
the kids hut was closed and no one to wait on you to bring you a cold drink 
food was delicious and great coffee 
both rooms offered access to the long balcony with a panoramic view from lake burley griffin 
these hotels are great 
eventually we got back to the hotel 
ask for higher floor 
and cinema in easy walking distance 
staff was very friendly and checkin was quick and efficient 
it has such a magnificent historical charm 
other pluses included great valet staff and bar in the middle is a lot of fun--just 
the staff are always friendly 
nice restaurants and amazing location with very nice view 
it was still a free shuttle service to disney and universal which was great but nowhere near as flexible 
great hotel in an excellent position 
shower curtains were torn and shower was functional at best 
the facilities are are first class but the service from the staff is what makes the hotel special 
istanbul is a wonderful city to visit and if you want to get away from the busy city 
helpful staff at reception and a very supportive concierge desk who helped us a lot distributing invites 
it 's got some great restaurants 
we asked for a packed breakfast for an early departure - unfortunately it was a bland sandwich with an apple 
the lobby is very nice and sheraton quality 
though rooms are looking old and need up gradation but are well appointed and very well kept 
fairly small and certainly nothing special compared to other comparable hotels in major cities in india 
old antiquated bedroom furniture the lobby is lovely the bedrooms need an upgrade the styling is n't my 
large pool & really good breakfast 
nice lounge was at this fine hotel and enjoyed the comfort of the lobby lounge . 
situated close to both the suidobashi metro station and the jr station 
authentic japanese greens and salad dressing 
( think a double bed with about 1m around it ) 
until i realized a cup of coffee is 8 usd and a small bagel with salmon is 17 
long whiskey menu and great seating 
the suidobashi jr station is good for the airport transfer ( ca 
excellent breakfast buffet with a stunning view over the city from the 33rd floor and a few nice 
i actually ended up bringing my own gym shorts 
it 's just minutes away from a nice mall and different public transportation 
wired internet access was free - nice 
staff friendly at checkin 
the beds are hugely comfortable 
good business hotel next to one at changi 
and is now quite the little town 
so good if your business meeting is around the area 
stray hairs on the bathroom floor and ( more importantly ) they would n't let us check in 
limited options- room standards are similar to a motel 's- expensive considering its standards- slow internet 
20 . 
i usually can get an early check in or some coffee . 
there is in house laundry available in this hotel 
lounge sofa with extra 2 throw pillows with a large wall-mounted flat tv in front 
great rooms with big bathrooms and facilities 
although once the mrt is completed the trip should be a lot quicker 
it does have a large atrium so aim for a higher floor 
rooftop bar is great 
6 ) the lobby and the decor of the hotel is not very park hyatt 
with great facilities 
any way the spread is good 
i was so glad that my request for a seaview deluxe room was fulfilled during check- 
the hotel is only 2 months old and the staff are very enthusiastic 
it 's location and it 's modern decor 
after having read so many bad reviews of this hilton 
historic plaza and made our santa fe experience very pleasant indeed 
gilbert and perry at the front desk were exceptional ( these gentleman do not just do their 
pool is large and seems to be popular with families 
i was also impressed with the housekeepers who kept the rooms very clean 
eggs benedict were superb and the coffee was free flowing 
great value for money and perfect for a city break 
the bed was very comfortable and the linens were plush 
the room furniture is dated ( see pics ) 
the bathroom had a great walk-in shower with rainwater head 
this is a beautiful property in a truly beautiful region of india 
in contrast the roof top terrace bar has great views over the city and a good selection of drinks 
the decor and the location are second to none 
we did order an extra bed for the older kid 
despite having an already limited menu 
the location is central 
menu has limited variety but the friendly chefs will be happy to prepare if you want something special 
the views from the hotel are magnificent ! 
the lobby is stunningly beautiful 
since it is a luxurious hotel 
the staff was excellent 
the staff in the lounge works very hard to keep the tables clean and updating the food 
that room was clean and had a view 
while the hotel is nicely located in downtown pittsburgh and is the reincarnation of a 1906 office 
the strip district is a longer walk but still quite possible 
will probably stay at this hotel next time i am in the area 
and beautifully decorated 
the only option left to enjoy beach or pool was placing our towels on the sand in the tiny shade 
they did recognize my hhonors diamond status with a nice upgrade and food beverage credit 
all in all go somewhere else - much better hotels for similar rates are available 
the nice thing about the location is that the hilton is surrounded by a lot of restaurants just outside 
we made use of the awesome fitness center on numerous occasions 
the customer service is atrocious and the rooms are worse 
the bathroom was very spacious with a double sink 
it has three bedrooms and a den - basically a four bedroom . 
you have access to a tower exclusive pool which is nice 
good size room 
the rooms are rather old and the front desk service is usually not good 
you could not open the window 
which is very safe for swimming 
the pools are very nice 
the hilton hawaiian village in kalia was the venue for our annual santos family 
the bathrooms are well thought out and of good size 
the lobby is nice and the breakfast was good but the room was dark and needs work 
it took about four tries with the wrong room assignment s and keys that did not work 
i think it is a solid value four-star downtown hotel 
overall they do a pretty good job maintaining such a large property but there are definitely some rough edges 
i would encourage families with babies to be cautious when booking this hotel . 
restaurant facilities where great and it 's location was wonderful 
on the downside the lifts are slow requiring lots of waiting and the breakfast - well we went once and 
free wifi internet 
if you want to be able to sit on a crowded beach and then hit the same high end boutique 
i forgot once some gadgets and they had kept safely and even offered to courier it back 
the apartment very clean 
provide free shuttle around town 
received double beds 
this is a fantastic alternative to a central london stay and only a 2 minute walk from the station 
we were on the lowest floor possible but a much higher room would have been welcomed as we have diamond 
since hotel is really huge with many different towers and buildings you should carefully think where to go 
ask for charley 's cabs andget to from airport for only 29 
the men 's lounge area is a couple of hot tubs put together with a steam room 
we tried several of the restaurants 
it is the largest hotel complex in waikiki 
a modernist glass terraced structure overlooking the adriatic 
the cons for this place - the pools get really busy and the chairs are all packed in super close 
that was by far the best vacation decision i made in the last few yearswe have booked this hotel 
nice bed and sheets 
it is off the main street in a courtyard 
this is a wonderful hotel to stay in while in london 
clean with a comfortable double bed 
the breakfast buffet is excellent 
amenities are from czech and speake a butler and all the facilities to make you stay 
the bed was a welcome site after the long flight and was very comfortable 
close to some landmark tourist places and the theatres 
loved having a perfectly made martini in the scarves bar after drinking only rose and pastis 
the suites are nice and big 
the shower was awesome in a large entirely marble bathroom with nice floris products 
limited menu dinner campground style in the middle of the desert with flies eating you alive 
it was spacious and the d cor was simple yet sleek and pleasant 
the bed was very soft 
breakfasts has great pastries but no bacon 
nice breakfast room with polite service 
because you get to see the rock all day from the lodge 
a good sized room 
the rooms all open out onto a large deck with comfy chairs in which one can enjoy time while 
we had a nice big walk in wardrobe 
location is downtown right opposite the marriott & starbucks - across from hyatt and right next to 
the calgary location is superior in this reviewer 's mind to the montreal location to such an 
everyone kept this as a surprise for her until we were driven down the driveway and the helicopter landed in 
the food and wines are wonderful and the hikes 
excellent service 
the rooms are very modern and located on the higher floors of the building as the lower floors are used 
ask for high room 
which is sharing the same tower but different lifts 
small pool bar sells good value snacks and fair priced drinks 
take bts train at the national stadium station in front of the hotel 
the bathroom decor is nice red marble and dark wood 
small comfortable lobby with typically friendly polite thai staffs 
fortunately i was able to locate a 3-pin plug in one of the sockets to charge my mobile 
the concierge team was one of the best i 've ever encountered 
from the airport you can take a taxi for 450 bath or take the subway 
mbk is just opposite and siam area is a short walk away 
bts station is right outside the entrance 
with nice contemporary furnishings 
complimentary high speed internet everywhere in the facility 
some of our members stayed overnight and were complimentary about the room and the breakfast 
stunning rooms 
bed super comfortable 
good facilities 
very good facilities 
we had an early flight so decided to book a hotel for the night before 
i would be delighted if you click on i found the review helpful icon 
the gym is good and they have a very nice pool area 
modern hotel very close for terminal 3 heathrow 
the staff were very polite and they did arrange for a car to take us to terminal 5 at 5 
breakfast superb 
the reception staff are great and always happy to assist with directions 
change at siam to the silom line and go to surasak station and you are there 
the juice was excellent and the salmon was quite possibly the best i 've had 
to get back to the airport same thing - the bus - one goes to terms 1 and 3 the 
if the food is such good quality and the chefs amazing 
so it ended up only costing 60 per night for the first 3 nights and 75 for the last night 
average choices but foods quality are higher compare to other hotel 
go for high floors overlooking the river ( slightly more expensive but worth it ) 
waiting 20mins to check-out is a joke 
the rooms are elegant 
the pool is incredible and picture-perfect 
very nice hotel with clean rooms with great views over bangkok 
although the bathrooms are small and the shower is over the bath 
they have multiple large pools so you can pick whichever suits you 
this is a beautiful facility and great hotel 
plus the pools and lazy river 
bedding was good and the bed comfortable 
after few disappointing days i got a call from mr rami fahad the director of reservation 
and cold towels throughout the day and have iced tea for sale in a small cart by that pool 
rooms are of good size with nice lounging areas and fully furnish with all the amenities you need 
this is an amazing resort - and we have been coming here for years 
the chinese restaurant ( a little disappointing ) and then the beach pavilion ( superb ) the staff 
a stay at this hotel - and a visit to this wonderful city of muscat - are both highly 
a half bath in the entry way 
the room are very luxuroios in style with floor to ceiling glass - even the deluxe rooms 
it was giving you the feeling of your flat with the extra luxury 
but as the property is a few years old 
the long bar is a bit quiet but has a nice terrace 
excellent breakfast 
there is an adult only pool but it was probably the least scenic of the 3 pools 
kids loved the breaking waves and we were able to body surf a couple of days- breakfast buffet is 
friendly and the restaurant offered delicious thai cuisine 
food options outside the hotel are much cheaper and you will have to decide between eating at the hotel or 
the only downside was that arriving mid morning after a 13 hour flight and half hour transfer our room was 
and its a quiet area 
only gripe and its a very small one is that dead beetles were sometimes left on the floor and 
i guess this is nice if you want to take a bath and open all the curtains to the outside 
the mini bar was weirdly cheaper that the normal bar 
what a first visit 
when we had finished we walked past the japanese one which was fully opened and serving 
which is great from a space perspective- half an hour drive from the airport- a few different restaurants 
our room area is a tad tight 
but if you are looking for a well priced family resort on the island you wo n't get better 
( the concierge helpfully arranged a visit to see rescued elephants in natural habitat ) 
these hotels provde full set of toiletaries and necessities 
i agree with most reviews to say that the breakfast buffet is huge 
giving you a nice sitting area 
the prices are very expensive 
the villas are huge with every facility you could wish and with views out of this world 
the hotel bar and lobby are an architectural masterpiece and it was great to have a drink at sunset 
there are a lot of good restaurants to explore in ubud which is a short taxi ride 
no air -conditioningnoise - as there is no a c you need to open windows 
on arrival at reception you are greeted personally by name and escorted over the bridge with truly amazing views of 
with the bridge that connects between entrance and the lobby 
we had stayed at both facilities in bali and both were excellent hope to return at some stage - 
i also recommend arranging for their vehicle to pick you up as the airport is a bit chaotic - if 
wonderful high tea with mother-in-law 
nthis resort fully deserves its reputation 
there was dust on the bedside tables and the daily room clean was not up to standard 
i would stay somewhere else next time 
with such a good service and amenities i do n't mind the very small rooms 
lots of great activities to do ( trekking 
the privacy and the service are second to none 
the main building is special and minimalistic yet tasteful 
location away from the main restaurant night life scene but next door to a great ymca 
great value for the money 
this property is just lovely 
rooms are very good value as well 
the company provides free internet that is better than the premium one at the hotel for free to those taking 
so the hgi is still a very good value for your money 
plenty of electrical outlets 
everyone at the hotel and restaurants was very friendly and eager to please 
the gym is quite big and well equipped 
quality of room better than marriot or hilton 
so overall good stay but room for improvement to make this an outstanding hotel 
we had the highest floor and got the best view of the city from our room 
the reception area is very busy and small while the concierge area is spacious but empty - ie 
it 's in fact adjacent to a shopping mall with cheap bites 
a big bathroom with shower only 
first impression of this property is the very spacious lobby and the check in process very efficient 
the location is great 
i could have listened to them all night long in spite of the expensive drinks 
we stayed in the direct pool access rooms where you can jump directly into the pool which stretches some 3 
if you eat local breakfast there are coffee shops nearby 
this is a beautiful property and you will be in awe of the swimming pool for the first timers 
one of my favourite hotels for short-stays in bergen 
stayed 2 nights and totally enjoyed our stay 
good restaurants 
when you will come to a long deserted beach and wil see horizont 
the spa ran occasional 50 off deals - but if you did not mention that you 've seen the 
the desk staff were very nice and efficient and the security guard in front was very helpful 
property like this 
the hotel is close enough to be able to walk to the palace so is in a great location 
pancakes and the works 
the airconditioning is very noisy 
hotel was full so breakfast room was full and bit noisy on pick times 
gym facility was good and there is also a roof top pool 
the setting is incredible with an outdoor and indoor seating area and amazing views over the city 
the carousel bar is very historic and interesting -but can get extremely crowded which makes getting drinks difficult 
the first time we stayed we were in room 109 which was a grand suite that overlooked the pool 
pool in a quadrangle so no sun but nice little pool bar and happy hour 
the hotel itself is well provided with many guest facilities and superb service by the staff 
was some street noise but reasonable trade-off for the room and location 
grand location and rooms but very poor staff 
with vietnamese and western dishes 
location - 30 minute car drive from the sea port and it has good white sandy beach 
so we try to get a separate bedroom and some privacy 
the room and facility was very clean and i thoroughly enjoyed my stay 
ideal to take a flight early morning 
offers reasonable rooms and dining 
they also charge you for airport shuttle ( this was disclosed 
the resort is located on the south eastern part of phuket 
space or noise were the only options as hotel was at capacity 
harsh lighting in bath room 
and the location was very nice---just two minutes from a metro station and with many bars and restaurants 
across the street from one metro and 1 block from another 
with easy access by public transport and a nice ambience about the area 
and there is a room with two mac computers hooked up to the internet which you can also use for 
there are also several excellent pools and lounge areas 
and free parking 
was a one bedroom suite with separate living room 
generally it is a beautiful property in a good location and what makes this hotel such a great find 
i think it 's time for new beds 
too bad they did n't have complimentary breakfast like other small town hotels 
so i can understand why the front desk staff may not be overly friendly given they are dealing with these 
pay high prices ( us retail ) and read for your entire stay 
the only perk is probably the free internet wifi 
all the rooms ( technically all are chalets ) are located on hill tops and you need a 
i would suggest a more traditional thai resort 
there is only 2 restaurants 
separate bedroom with massive ensuite including free standing bath tub 
the rooms were rather old & there was n't a manual in the room to advise us how to 
overall a nice resort with some limitations 
there is also an indoor pool areas which we did n't try 
dishes empty etc 
hotel very close to the airport 
hotel layout is good 
the lobby and the restaurant 
small but adequate gym 
the club lounge was very nice to read the paper 
food and the restaurant are great 
at least a very good starting point for your activities in the area and the hotel is modern and nice 
great bed 
the staff was great and it 'll cost half of what the upper echelon hotels will run 
cannot figure out the heated floor setting in the room 
i got almost zero sleep for 3 nights here due to the traffic noise 
breakfast was fantastic with a very high quality continental spread and lots of great menu order items as well 
my room on the top floor had really good views of the city and was very spacious 
we did a perfect hotels combination as we stayed at the hotel near to taksim before 
free wi fi with perfect quality 
the interior of the room was similar feeling quite dated 
very well located - 20min walk to bcec 
the bed was heavenly and the service very high 
great hotel away from the hustle-bustle of taksim square & the old town 
it had a great selection for a smaller hotel with wonderful cakes pastries and fruit cheeses and yo 
the lobby is very nice 
we were upgraded to one of the larger rooms on the 6th floor with a partial view of the 
fridge was well stocked with good priced beer 
rooms are nicely decorated 
really enjoyed the hotel with nice large rooms and comfortable beds 
apart the soft furnishing 
we look forward to our next visit 
the staff were very helpful for an early arrival and made a room available 
and opened the windows 
my only constant concern was that the staff always left the entrance doors open 
wonderful shops 
the crowne plaza is right in the centre of coogee with great restaurants 
the internet is limited at high speed to 200 mb per day ( at a 29 
room was spacious but i found the rain-shower pressure in the toilet to be very poor and 
) the bed was super comfy and the room was spacious 
the hotel is conveniently located in coogee 
there is an exit just next to the main entrance of the hotel 
we had an ocean view room but really it was an ocean glimpse room as sitting on the balcony you 
we were too tired to venture out so we spent our time in the cafe next to the lobby 
we asked him for something unique and he suggested an island infused margarita , with 
the pool is nice 
it offers limited rooms only as the hotel mainly serves training students ( i 
top notch service 
and there are many great restaurants within a couple miles of the hotel 
short wine list but some good choices on it 
the large pool sits right next to the restaurant 
the breakfast restaurant is in open area and there are lots of birds flying around 
and a very safe white sand beach if you do n't mind the very warm sea water 
you must take the bus right ot the hotel 
near public transportation and with many good neighbor restaurants nearby 
there are some elevated walkways to navigate and get over the busy roads in this area 
very good value for a room on a high-rise floor with stunning views of the city 
we stayed in exec room - worth the extrawhat a place cannot recommend too highly - all great 
given the proximity of the other hotels in this chain and the souk there are plenty of restaurants and 
amenities sufficient 
spacious corner suite and the people are just brilliant 
extremely convenient to transportation and all nightlife 
and the food is excellent 
swimming pool is nice 
this is a wonderful facility 
it was a pretty decent stay not so amazing like any other we want our this is also a successor 
pool area is quite nice for an airport hotel 
the beautiful serene beach 
good amenities 
since we were on a low floor we can hear the noise outside but it did n't bother us 
the rooms are clean and nicely furnished 
the hotel is short walk to pavilion and sungei wang complexes 
rooms are your normal types with a fancy bed and a nice balcony but a very small bathroom which is 
the hotel is lovely 
kids activities were a plus like the magic show 
on my most recent visit about 5 days ago i was told i was upgraded and promptly give a double 
the staff are exceptional 
they all have nice patios with deck chairs 
there was a single shower setting for the shower head 
still top quality and every inch a 5 star standard 
huge bathrooms 
the internet was very bad as it dropped in and out - breakfast was good 
staff in the hotel very pleasant and sociable 
the bathroom is clean and spacious with a separate shower area 
there is also no mini fridge bar 
rather then interact and help the hotel gueststhey have 2 very overpriced restaurants - japanese 
and the fastest durned free wifi i think i have ever come across in china 
i double checked on the status 
this is one of the newest hotels in the city 
the free wifi which came with hh membership was fast - i could watch my tv dramas without any 
the spa was great 
updated with heavy wood features in the lobby and common areas 
bath had both roomy shower and separate tub 
excellent breakfasts 
the pool is really nice and they keep it clean 
in addition a super big shopping mall is very close 
they offer a huge variety of different meals 
good location for the hotel if going to mid valley and the convenience of airport express to from the airport 
we stayed here two nights while touring jaipur and we really should have stayed longer to better enjoy 
so its a complete package and not just a stay 
with good accessibility from klia 
wonderful good sized rooms with bathroom to die for as they include a rainforest shower 
the pool is also resort style and excellent if there is not many children running around 
would i recommend this hotel - yes very much so and if we ever were to return to the lovely 
lovely heritage property with great service 
very good price quality 
- club lounge overall is a fair space 
nice pool slide 
the room size big enough 
effective air conditioning 
only a few small things that were n't great - the spa was cold 
it 's farther away from city center yet conveniently located with easy access to nearby malls and restaurants 
located just outside of the city it 's nice and central to both the city 
the essentials of any hotel is a good nights sleep and reception staff who care 
the only issue maybe was that water from our shower got into the bathroom pretty easily we had to request 
and are supposed to get a welcome drink and of course get points for your stay 
good size wardrobe with no clothes hangars 
see you next visit in my home from home in kl 
bed and pillows were super comfortable 
the buffet breakfast each morning had a good choice of continental and cooked breakfast options & loved the coffee machine 
bathroom toiletries also generous sizes and the inclusion of a loofah with the bath gel was 
very good quality 
front desk staff charly took the initiative to arrange for an early check-in that was complimentary and 
the hotel is a great base for exploring the rest of whistler village which was much smaller than we 
the hilton is a great business hotel 
still a nice stay 
one of the very best hilton hotels 
i can always be assured of an excellent stay at the hilton 
with a musty smell 
the hotel is literally opposite the main train station with excellent links - there is a big shopping centre and 
half of the lobby is currently going through a major refurbishment resulting to 2 of thier restaurants being 
since we are carrying lots of luggage and young child we needed to book the vip service from k 
these facilities help you to unwind after a long day 
a poor overnight stay and i wo n't be back unless they make the pods free again 
so i did n't have the features of the apartment that one might expect booking into a sebel 
white furniture and draping curtains 
there was not nearly enough closet space 
this was a very generous and quality breakfast buffet that included the most exquisite buttery croissants 
the entrance is very miami and the whiteness and music is very cuban 
car park was secured and the underground was link via elevators to the rooms 
right on the top floor 
the bed was comfortable and the room was clean and nice 
hotel is located next to one of the main shopping and dining streets with lots of activity 
modern bathroom 
the orange old towels just did not complement the lovely rooms and bathrooms 
while this hotel is close to the train station 
close to each other on the same floor 
the hotel gave us a twin bed room so we could sleep and take showers 
a very short walk from central station brings you to the renaissance amsterdam hotel 
large room and amazingly comfortable bed 
it is actually good value to stay in renaissance 
enjoyed family dinner at the kurious kiwi ( or something like that - next to 
room has a mini kitchenette but no microwave or plates cutlery which seemed weird to us as 
understaffed restaurant ( had to search for someone to place order ) 
great wifi 
staff at the hotel are pleasant and helpful 
its a pretty short walk from central station and you are right near the siegel and not far from 
located in amsterdam central area 
with excellent service and a really nice touch of small a-la carte menu with their buffet breakfast 
go to a high floor to maximize the distance between you and the traffic 
expensive - small rooms 
i constantly found staff members willing and anxious to help 
great staffs who become friends during the stay 
the prime street of jakarta 
the breakfast buffet was excellent 
smallest that i have ever stayed at ( i have stayed at many euope hotels which have 
it was actually quite good 
small hotels of holland and enjoyed them 
facilities are in good condition and the working 
the renovations are complete - and happily the only thing which is the same is the standard of service 
i 'd recommend it for business users but not for your luxury seeking travellers . 
when i entered the hotel lobby 
the facilities of the hotel include a bar on the corner ( thanks to harry the bar tender for 
which is a pity as they served very good lunch bento 
always book your hotel on arrival at the airport at some of the hotel counters and the best rates are 
that is just spreading the good news that the hotel is upgrading the rooms 
we were put in a very nice redecorated room . 
there is a little alley ( totally safe ) near the fortune hotel across the street that is full of 
as spg platinum i was upgraded to a suite which was a smoking room . 
it really is worth taking the time to walk the corridors and public areas to view all the memorabilia 
i find the lobby toilet modern & i ca n't help but think why ca n't they do 
and very close to the airport 
the negatives regarding this hotel is the breakfast room is very crowded and small for hotel of this size 
clean but no hot water in shower at 4 
relaxing hotel that sends you back in time to the british colonial period in southern r 
higher floor rooms are better as sound travels a bit in this hotel 
breakfast and evening meal in the livingstone restaurant was very good 
so avoid staying here if you want a smaller 
getting better great location , modern , and comfortable . 
that you have to leave at a desk when you leave the hotel for the day 
only the basic gym 
with beautiful old world charm 
this hotel has the best access to the falls 
the rooms are dark but well kept and the shower worked better than the one in portofino bay 
can get busy to make reservations if you can . 
room was spacious and bathroom wonderful 
family pool small and large garden area across from pool with lounge chairs very quaint 
corner suites on higher floors quiet and comfy 
i last visited this property 30 years ago 
the dinner and breakfast are both good 
we always end up having dinner there one of the nights 
it was clean and convenient and a decent price 
good location 
the desk had knife marks where other customers had gouged marks into the wooden desk and the console table 
ended up using the coffee tea hot pot to add freshly boiling water to the bath 
i guess the hotel concessionaire figures they can get away with 500 nightly charges for outdated ( but historic 
i always take photo after check in and you can see the room look marvelous in foto 
i had a meeting next door and this was the best located 5 star hotel 
we walked from hotel through harley street , oxford street , park lane , hyde park 
the separate lounge area which hosted happy hour and also breakfast 
free pick up from airport and also free trip back to the airport for accor status members was a 
however the bathroom and the toiletries supplied needs to be better 
the lobby of hotel is very nice with a concierge and money changer on the ground floor 
superb brand new building 
so also the underground station is at the same distance 
and offer an amazing break fast spot in front of the red square with the sunrise 
convenient to reach by ferry pus complimentary hotel shuttle from hk airport 
check-in took a bit of time but the overall hotel experience was good 
one of the finest and modern hotels in hilton chain 
service is excellent and there is a huge breakfast spread 
convenient walk to subway station and the seaworld for dinner or a quick drink 
hilton has done well to hire excellent staff 
the hotel is dated and so are the rooms . 
the swimming pool was great and staff were always on hand to help you 
the front desk staff is so friendly and the pool area is absolutely beautiful 
the room has seen better days 
it 's not one of the most happening locations in dubai for sure but is connected well with 
so it makes a great walk 
this our new place to stay in bali 
rest & relax in a busy kuta area 
everyone needs internet and in every good business hotel it should be free 
the hotel service was good and it was a nice and pleasant stay 
the front desk staff noticed that i was not feeling well ( i had runny nose and sore throat 
there is free wireless internet access in the lobby 
i waited more than one hour for my room 
we have stayed in this hotel only for one night 
the gym was a little disappointing with limited free weights 
so the soundproofing and the comfort of the bed must be pretty good 
n nbreakfast on the second floor ( you get little blue vouchers for each day of your stay 
better hotels for less money in the city 
which does n't look like the much more modern classic furniture in the website photo 
restroom also looks new and luxury 
the rooms with the castleview are the best 
although the drinks were somewhat pricey and the service a little haphazard 
but being a hhonors diamond i would have expected a higher floor or better view ( of the 
the corridors had a musky smell and the carpets looked dirty and dated 
staff at the desk were very helpful 
with the poor lighting at night 
teh pool loks good as well 
we ate in the brasserie restaurant and it was very , very good . 
i dont even know if the hotel has a room service menu 
nice amenities in the bathroom too 
i have taken a long time to review this hotel as we did have a lot of issues and i 
impressive spaces that befit the caley 's reputation 
the pool and sauna were available and very nice 
my overall experience at the hotel was that it was just okay not bad but not great-lobby 
the hotel is located in miraflores 
i was upgraded to a great suite with a great bathrooms 
the room was of a decent size with a great bathroom with an excellent shower ( no bath ) with 
linens and towels new and nice 
it is centrally located for easy walks to the millennium park 
the bathroom had only one sink 
conference facilities really good - big rooms 
nice bathroom and super good breakfast buffet 
rooms were fairly clean 
the rooms were a nice size and the room included a large walk-in shower 
we used all the amenities and felt like it was a good value 
excellent hotel we stayed at the hilton one night at the start of our peru trip - 
the gentleman at reception says no balcony 
the concierge was able to book us a table at sky city at short notice 
it was a very nice size room with a sitting area and the bedroom closed off nicely with a sliding 
with a complimentary welcome drink at the bar - genuine bubbly 
with completentary cava available too 
the best service and attitude on earth 
the roof bar and bar downstairs are very nice 
also upon check-in my room was n't ready 
the pool area is a nice place to catch a few rays or just relax 
wifi access is limited to an hour a day which is a bit mean for a trendy hotel 
the workout room and especially the pool is fantastic 
they have given the best services to their customer with simple execution that many other 5 star hotel unable to 
i ate at cinnamon ( all day dining ) and liked it although the wonderful staff is what i will 
it feels like you 're staying at grannie 's 
the location was very convenient 
our flight was late 
complimentary fruit bowls that they kept refilling 
very comfortable bed although i found the lightings a bit on the dim side . 
except for the ones located next to the street really noisy at night 
from nathan at the front door to the front desk and room maids 
the restaurants are also highly recommended 
location is central to everything in seattle and access to from the major interstate is easy as is access 
great customer service 
it is located in a busy section of jakarta ( on the round-about ) 
the spa was very nice 
superb breakfast 
with separate bath and shower 
room size which is a big issue in europe 
in the bedroom had another 32 lcd tv ( with international tv stations ) 
we rented a car which the hotel charged us 30 a day to park but the service ( valet 
rooms can be pretty noisy with street noise late into the night but i guess you would expect this right 
and a nice walk from circular quay 
the view from the room is just amazing and the spread during breakfast is just amazing 
and the streets are very noisy at night so you cannot leave balcony doors open 
a lot of the plates were empty as they were not fast enough to do the cooking and i did 
sound insulation in the bedroom is non-existent - you could sleep in the middle of the street and 
adequate but great location 
i wonder if it 's worth to pay more for a business class suite than just a standard 1 
sleep quality is good but if you are staying on lower floors 
as it was empty- pastry warmer on day 2 not turned on so all pastries cold- only 
bed was nice 
we asked the hotel to check which terminal we were to leave from at the airport ( wifi was bad 
but the bed itself was super comfy and i slept well 
good bathrom and on top of all this a very good price - now this not all folks it 
breakfast is served on the top floor with nice views 
rooms and service better 
the view was nothing to write home about even though we were on a high floor 
in the former french concession 
long wait and getting a breakfast table can be a bother if busy 
there were plenty of other options nearby 
maybe old and tiredbut being rejuvenated good room - bathroom tired but functionalgood breakfast in the f 
the shower was seperate and was one of the best i have had in a long time 
room comfortable and staff always attentive 
very large lobby and friendly reception staff 
hotel bar has nice selection and atmosphere 
we arrived much earlier than the advertised check in and the room was available- very good well done 
the lobby was nice 
we did not eat at the hotel but spent every night exploring auckland with them as it was easy 
higher floors should bring you away from traffic noise and better view 
front desk helpful and the gym is decent 
reasonable hotel in good location 
one of the guys at the entrance was very nice and over our stay his welcome greetings became so 
room service from the chinese restaurant was excellent 
within a minute 's walk you could be right on the d sseldorf strasse which 
a lovely welcome from the reception staff with a welcome drink was very nice 
the hotel reception was extremely pleasant 
and then access to a room to shower and freshen up before my next long flight 
high ceiling 
hip breakfast as previously flagged . 
because other options were not available and was disappointed 
the room was small but very clean and had excellent wifi 
the bathroom was also clean and attractive 
i also liked the large window and amount o light in bath 
fitness centre and pool are good too 
they would even engage in small casual talks and going the extra mile to get metered-taxi 
greeting you in a large airy lobby 
location is not great but it is not worth paying triple to stay at the st regis 
but the best was the massage 
busy area 
the roof top bar is nice 
its probably a lot more convenient to walk to a 7 eleven next to the hotel to bring essentials 
a property well located to shopping area 
not so great value 
great rooftop bar 
i decided to stay here versus my usual 5 hotel in makati due to the significant price differential 
the rooms were spacious 
this was my first time stay here 
free buffet breakfast 
lunch in the main restaurant was very good 
lobby was under renovation so starbucks was regulated to the bar and provided the bare minimum 
the rooms are decently done and size is also average 
my room was on the 17th floor and on the quiet part of hotel 
very convenient to shopping 
great staff 
the fitness gym on the 9th floor is simply one of the best and largest i have ever seen 
but the western lunch is very very good 
ask for one on a high floor facing michigan ave 
hard chinese worn furniture 
breakfast was good and gym incredible 
the entrance and most of the buildings are uninspiring and the facilities were so so 
it was just super to have shower outside everyday 
magical magical is the word . 
i did ask for an extra bed 
the complimentary mineral water was also not replenished 
the resort is one of the best i have stayed 
the staff were kind enough to get us a care package of food on the day we checked out ( 
i found mine to be charming with modern amenities 
we were lucky to get a huge room with all details 
the suite was spacious and well designed with cathedral ceiling and beautiful floor and ceiling wood 
the hotel itself is nice and the exec lounge on 22 is lovely 
the hotel is new and centrally located 
cafes and bakeries nearby as well as a convenience store right next door 
in what is a decent 5 star hotel 
there is a small walkable interesting night market across the street and my room was with lake and water 
nicely decorated namsan view room very close to elevator but did n't feel noise coming from 
like all other hotels they nickel and dime you by charging gbp6 per night to park your car 
you can either take a free hotel bus 
i have always been very pleased with the hotel 
the new club lounge is a first for w brand and it 's beautifully designed and very friendly staff 
there was a shuttle bus available from airport which you need to pay for 5 gbp in cash to 
hotel is great 
the work desk was comfortable and had plenty of connections to make working fairly easy 
1 being by the hoppa bus number h56 which costs 4 pounds or if you arriving into terminal 
an overall good experience 
one night perfect for hotel departure 
the bedrooms are small but that is not unusual in paris 
this is a modern boutique ic hotel in the paris city centre 
the lobby is at the ground floor together with the bar 
the service was second to none - special mention to roland shi ( chief concierge ) 
went to the macdonalds down the road for breakfast as we wanted to stretch our legs but there 
stayed in a single deluxe room with king sized bed on 36th floor and the room is 
sleep quality was very good and there was virtually no airport noise 
room service options severely limited 
be aware that the bar closes early on a sunday night 
the hotel is not at all convenient for restaurants - most being a 4-5 taxi ride away 
restaurant and bar staff were good when you tracked them 
was here for a conference and one of the lunches was at the holiday inn 
the bar is empty because of the band playing at a deafening volume 
breakfast was well staffed to enable a good range of options 
this is a great dog friendly hotel 
30pm i asked about food they did a limited menu and the next table that was available was after 
cityside rooms have a great view across the mandalay palace site 
the hotel feels like a palace 
it is a truly beautiful building 
we had an issue with noise from adjoining water park when all we wanted was rest after a long flight 
we booked to deluxe rooms and the hotel was nice enough to upgrade us to the a jr 
my only complaint was the fact that the cashier gave a terrible exchange rate and there was no 
but the bar in the lobby is bright ( except for the odd dark 'library' area ) 
located in a perfect center of city this is a very good hotel 
diner at the asian restaurant was very good and staff perfect 
wonderful luxury at a reasonable price by western standards 
the junior suite is nice but it has a little humity smell 
best designed trendy area with large tv screens playing sport 
i booked this hotel for day stay as we left cruise ship early and had our flight in the evening 
breakfast was a little disappointing in the lounge even though the spanish lady there was wonderful 
the shuttle is a convenient 5 - 7 minutes away and runs promptly which was the key reason for our 
ate in the bar a couple of nights food was good and prices reasonable 
nice and close to airport 
very stylish and with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the venetian 
the hotel staff was eager to help everywhere that we went 
upon arriving the lobby is beautiful 
the bathroom had a bath shower which i hate but it did have a separate toliet which compensated 
if it were n't for the friendly employees and prompt shuttle service 
good value 
got a room overlooking the beautiful golf course 
well central city newcastle is 
all very good and really nice helpful staff 
there are lots of dining venues across the street and a short stroll away 
lots of great restaurants nearby 
with just a short walk to the terminal this hotel is ideal for an overnight stay 
you get complimentary access to the gold 's gym next door 
efficient check-in ( with one free cookie 
efficient business hotel 
i found the bathroom to be nice and clean 
and a very fresh welcome drink 
there was a small minibar and coffee pot 
of course the private plunge pool is fantastic 
smaller holiday inn is almost at the airport so dont confuse the two 
highly recommend but request a high floor 
with all the positive reviews written about this hotel 
wide dining options for an airport hotel 
the business centre is a world away from the rooms 
bottom line great property nice beach pool was great lots of chairs etc around food is typical sheraton 
who worked the front desk at the holiday inn you want ( the m4 j4 one ) was 
higher floor with better views 
restaurant food was okay but prices were reasonable for a resort 
no free wifi 
good hotel but a long way away from heathrow 
00 am check intook advantage of the not at all expensive upgrade for members which give you free internet 
as other ta 's say the front desk area is nicely chilled and looks modern and attractive 
rooms are more spacious than the ones in parisian or venetian 
the shopping had all the big brand names you would expect to find in a casino 
breakfast standard good quality hilton standardplenty of free car parking close to shopping malls 
it felt like a private lounge - especially when the personnel adressed us by our names 
room not sound proof which made it very noisy especially it is also very close to airport 
the property is new and stunning 
the staff were very efficient and hospitable 
quiet and relaxing in a perfect setting for walking in this seaside paradise 
food and drinks were expensive too 
i would stay again in visiting kk - although i probably would also spend a couple of days at 
the bed and linens were comfortable 
rooms were spacious and clean although some rooms were due for a refurbishment 
when i checked in the staff tried hard to find a non-smoking room for me 
hotel is located in resort enclave at end of island 
much more comfortable and quicker for the same price 
the pool area was a great place to cool down or soak up some sun 
fresh seafood for a tiny price 
this was our second trip to blr since moving to singapore just under 18 months ago 
furniture a bit worn 
the internet works at great speed 
the pool was a bit cold and the jacuzzi was not hot 
so i had to ask porter for our group 's welcome drink 
there is free wifi 
staff at reception very polite and helpful 
really nice apartments with lots of space ( each guy had his own bed and bath ) comfortable bedscon 
the kitchen was excellent and had everything we needed 
yotel offers a limited selection of hot food options 
the paper walls separating the balcony of you neighbor do not help 
in fact u cannot even fully open a huge suitcase in the space 
my girlfriend and i booked a deluxe double room because of an early flight out of heathrow 
the suit was fantastic and the bed was just amazing 
you do need a big budget as this hotel is not a cheap option 
the bed is a little firm for my liking 
the bathroom was larger than my apartment and the centerpiece was a sleek bath tub carved from stone 
) had a nice sized balcony too 
like i have read on many of the other reviews , every airport should have a yotel 
asked if it was a possible for a room overlooking the harbour 
the air conditioner is a problem 
water pressure is intermittent and the wi-fi fairly difficult in this room 
many chips off from the wood lined furniture and fittings 
it was quick and efficient service 
loads of fluffy white towels 
a better outlook than directly into adjacent post building 
the floor is fine wood and the bathroom is in black and white marble with nice lighting fixtures 
centrally located and happy staff 
you do n't feel like you are coming into a four and a half star hotel 
the basic bathroom had been patched up over the years and was showing signs of water damage 
restaurants and bars close to the hotel 
was fantastic to settle in and soak in the huge tub 
this is an excellent hotel with a friendly staff 
the beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is nice 
nice historic building 
incredibly friendly and warm staff 
the marina village is great for dinner or just a coffee 
this is an isolated spot and you are tied to the hotel ( very slow service and limited menu in 
the bathroom was big and spacious but the shower 
the worst is still how bad job the housekeeping did when cleaning the room 
nice walking trak if you get up early and the free billiards were a hit with the 
the hotel is easy and rooms very spacious and whilst a little on older side they feel comfortable 
had a great stay here for a couple of days before christmas 
the 'upgrade' included private club room private breakfast and use of the club lounge 
the spa is excellent 
it is n't a bit expansive lobby but who hangs about in hotel lobbies anyway 
very posh and stylish lobby and bar restaurant areas attentive 
we stayed in the middle if the building with no real windows but it was nice and comfortable and quiet 
it 'll be just right next to metro 
the location is good and the reception staff are good 
i 'd suggest going with an upper floor as the main level balconies are n't very good 
we were initially hesitant to stay at the fx since it 's trendy and hip orientation seems to 
the water park is indeed great and makes staying here worthwhile when everything is working which is not always the 
and the most importantly the price is quite reasonable 
in door swimming pool are the main points about this place 
had all the amenities that you would expect from a hotel of this quality 
the room was very nice with pleasant touches like the yakuta kimonos for us 
it has a beautiful lobby 
as well as complimentary access to wi-fi ( it 's normally not free as i understand it 
the desk was nice and large 
very nice and neat hotel 
breakfast was also available in the concierge lounge in the morning and included a nice selection of 
it is adjacent to a shopping mall and near a supermarket 
the swimming pool open until quite late which is good for me as i can still swim up to 11 
it was so nice to have such great customer service 
i would definitely stay here again 
there is a great pool ( think this is a hangover from the buildings former days as a y 
but did n't need the hassle - and these are doormen who live in the city 
clean room size ok 
there is also the free airport shuttle that takes you right to the door steps of the hotel from the 
with countless of eateries and shopping options nearby 
i was shocked that the gym shower was a open concept 
i wish the showers in melbourne hotels could have a more powerful flow of water 
maybe the wifi a little slow 
amazing beds 
the first room 1081 comes without a fridge and the faucet at the basin is so stiff 
the room looks very much used 
bathroom is big and up to date 
with enough guests to make it look like it is still operating 
the service is extremely professional 
the hotel is located close to shops and transport 
staff were great with easy checkin 
maybe i got one of the few rooms with an old bed 
few shangri-la i liked business trip made me visit this city often , i have stayed 
filled with old world soft furnishings 
for me , the best hotel chain in asia i have been already several times in shangri 
food and service at the executive lounge was very good 
and about a 15-20 minute walk to a lively waterfront area where sailing events were held during the 
lovely large room with 65inch tv fantastic 
stay at the valley wing . 
extra towels 
rude and inexperienced service 
just spent a very nice weekend in a hotel with good parking and easy to get to by road 
this is a giant mall with lots of dining choices on the upper floor 
i did not like the shower controls - there is only one tap 
breakfast was of outstanding quality in the lounge 
it 's ok for 1 or 2 nights but better places for the price elsewhere 
nothing is too much trouble - the lady at check in and the lady at breakfast deserve special mention 
be nice to the receptionist 
seems the pool attendants enjoy walking around with their noses stuck a little too high in the air catering 
are just a short taxi ride away 
the standard of this hotel is certainly a surprise and disappointment to me and my family 
the pool is a great little suntrap as well 
overall room was nice but amenities and furniture looking a little old 
avoid low floors due to street noise 
the bathroom was spacious and had a very good shower 
i didnt try the roof top bar but it looked amazing 
balcony goodvery close to all southbank has to offer 
stayed 4 nights including a friday saturday 
i was here for work for 1 night - the hotel is convenient to the convention centre but is otherwise 
the location is however perfect ( with tram stop around the corner and plenty of restaurants and shopping next door 
the room ( a twin with sofa bed ) was modern and clean 
enormous and comfortable double bed - with two duvets - and a pillow menu - was 
the only place to stay if at a convention 
reasonable price 
with maybe more hot options but perhaps that 's being picky 
spacious rooms and good service make this a great place to stay 
everything i needed including unlimited cappuccinos ( not horrible nescaf 
big and the beds are one of the best i have ever slept in 
and near great restaurants 
the hotel 's pool really is n't for swimming 
there was a billing error when i was checking out and they were quick to address it quickly 
the staff was cheerful and accommodating 
very good fittings 
concierge and restaurant staff were excellent 
pretty nice location and the property is in good shape 
is not worth the price 
it 's nice to get introduced to the staff but that onky works if you also get your 
the bed super comfortable 
i did appreciate the nice lobby bar and cafe 
the hotel is centrally located but quiet for in the city 
i have stayed quite a number of different hotels in canberra and i am seriously impressed with the 
preferring to wander down broadway as there are a lot of cool restaurants within a 5 minute 
ushered us to the front desk 
the building is gorgeous and the room service food quite good 
upon check in i was unexpectedly upgraded to a one bedroom apartment as were my friends with whom i was 
great wifi 
the bed was very comfortable as were the pillows ( request a soft one ) 
i like the decor at the grant and the hotel always upgraded my room to a suite and the rooms 
good sized balcony 
driskill experience good location of this hotel on the city center , with a prestigious facade on street 
good bathroom and shower and all the amenities - including a nespresso machine 
we learned so much about the workings behind the scenes and came out even more impressed by the staff team 
the restaurants were good and they do not take reservations 
the pool area and the beach are also fantastic 
the hotel is steeped in history and the restaurants offer a good choice of dishes to suit all tastes 
the tram is also about 300m away 
breakfast was continental buffet ( cold ) and you could order a hotplate as part of our package 
and has a nice shopping just around the corner 
the rooms were definitely better than expected 
a fabulous buffet - there was everything you could want 
the room is spacious with comfortable beds and good bathroom facilities 
with a large & very comfortable bed & very luxurious shower 
the tibet style building you see in the main description is closed for refurbishment 
especially the larger corner room we had on our last night 
the bed was super comfortable and so big we struggled to find each other 
room layout and size was large 
the old town is also very close by 
hotel very close to the metro 
this place bring many classic chic moment with all modern amenity unmatched of any 5 stars hotel 
i stayed here with my husband for four nights last week and we really enjoyed our stay 
this is the hotel for you 
fantastic breakfast with a huge variety 
breakfast spread is decent spread of western with a few thai dishes 
the thai restaurant is also very good 
fantastic breakfast ! 
easy walking distance to pedestrian areas 
there were also plenty of good sized towels and good products ( e 
it was good value but as i said 
a fabulous little boutique hotel located very centrally in boston 
but there are better options out there 
location is easy to get to staff are very helpful reception is dark rooms are of ok size but quite 
good design as soon you crossed the main entrance door through all the hotel 
check in was quick & the complementary drinks were a nice touch 
near lots of lovely little shops 
not least due to the great service 
muse is only a short walk to the skytrain station ( even shorter if you use the complimentary 
large relaxing space with desk and by hotel standards a decent sized mini bar 
good value and great location just lacking in service attitude 
then a large bedroom with a large bathroom off of that 
a 1 night stay for family function ended up 2 nights due to inter state and overseas vistors invited 
the pool of the hotel is very nice 
with little kitchenette if you were staying for a while aand living there 
near a main line station and the train fom the airport beats a taxi hands down 
and we were escorted to our room and given a quick overview of the room and the hotel 's 
and of course the property is just beautiful 
the inner gardens serene and the indoor pool and gym outstanding 
would n't hesitate to use again smashing place to stay and wish there were more hotels like this 
this was to set the standard of the most fantastic personable service exhibited by each member of staff at 
2 nights is enough though since kyoto is quite small 
it start to charge you 
this place also has a very nice swimming pool and hot spa area which is highly recommended - bring the 
nice to be able to walk to the parks in the morning and still close enough to the 'la 
the rooftop bar is a great place for tapas and wine 
the well-regarded wine bar bocanariz is just round the corner and we enjoyed 
i like staying in the main tower as the other towers are a bit of a hike 
the shower was terrible - barely any water pressure 
good breakfasts and good service too 
the free breakfast is a generous continental not hot ( available for pay ) but you have toeat it 
the check in on the 3rd floor rather than on ground level makes it somewhat burdensome if juggling 
access to the room is by swiping your room card only to access your floor 
easy access to the park make for a magical experience and are worth the expense 
very good value for money 
it is at least a 15-20 minute walk to the strip if you dont want to spend money 
guest laundries are located on the 5th and 7th floors but try the 7th floor 
understand the wait ride for the shuttle is also 20mins 
casino and the staff were great 
the free parking was also a nice plus 
the queen size bed was comfortable 
after researching the area for hotels having lived nearby for four years 
carrefour supermarket can be reach by 5-10 minutes by easy walking 
rooms a good size 
the staff at reception were very friendly 
it is quite fresh , modern and comfortable . 
the room was modern and really well laid out 
there was construction outside of our window - and we like to sleep late - but we were n't 
modern apartments with great amenities and good housekeeping 
undercover secured parking 
the pool is small 
we did use the hotel bar at happy hour between 5pm and 7pm and enjoyed sitting in the 
the room rate for internet is far more reasonable 10 bucks per day than the business centre which runs like 
the hotel is quite good condition and fairly well located 
there are plenty of fab restaurants in the area to explore anyway ( cheesecake factory and 
the one bad thing is it is difficult to catch a taxi and singapore taxis charge ridiculously high booking 
the hotel is really old with wooden floors and really small rooms 
bed and pillow quality was good 
they gave me the upgrade ( not sure which part was the upgrade 
all free of charge- that night 
the bathroom was dirty ( even when we were moved rooms there was barely any improvement ) and the shower 
) albert cooked a fantastic breakfast for me and even provided hp sauce 
it 's worth paying extra to get access to the club lounge for the delicious afternoon snacks 
we were forced to be at the construction site pool and the food menu was limited making us unable to 
the beach in front of the hotel is excellent 
room are good size and comfortable 
restaurants and centrally located with a good beach 
cultured or exotic setting on a nice beach 
we were shocked to be assigned the furthest room possible-- 5106 
position the best walk to restaurants and shops cheap duty free everywhere 
we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to dubai and the ritz carlton 
the hotel itself has really good facilities 
the resort organised a great airport transfer for me & the staff at the cascade pool bar were good 
the bar is fantastic and the front desk people are as helpful as they come 
very nice touch 
there are two large pools 
our suite was great and right next to the meritus club 
beautiful building in a great location 
breakfast selection was poor and quality does not live up to it 's brand 
and again something i would not expect for a full priced 5 hotel 
if you can afford the prices , this is quality . 
the rooms in the main building seem to be a bit older than the rest of the hotel and there 
the king size bed was extremely comfortable 
30am was to order room service at extra cost 
front desk staff was super helpful getting us tickets to siloso beach party 
i spent 3 nights here for my business trip and overall i was very happy for this hotel 
do ask for higher floors 
the price was very affordable and the rooms were large and very clean 
this was our first trip to sentosa ( but not to singapore ) and we thoroughly enjoyed our 
after a long flight i just took the room and settled 
hotel amenities is complete 
nice warm rain shower 
we stayed six nights and the hotel took a good care of us 
a vast array of restaurants from fast food to 3 michelin star dinning 
the location is quite convenient but i must warn that the service is not so good 
breakfast area was dimly lit and cramp with too many tables and pillars 
staff at the executive lounge were very courteous and the food served at happy hour was excellent 
drinks expensive ad service was very accommodating 
i would much rather travel into the city next time 
the lobby and downstairs bar area was very smart and you felt like you were in a very smart hotel 
the gym is a joke - the size lesser than a hotel room 
big windows 
not too far ( using a taxi ) from main shanghai attractions 
even better than the coffee that i have tried in new zealand 
a decent bed and a good shower 
we were given good suggestions for places to eat and explained the places to visit in great detail 
the seperate shower itself is big but the shower head is very small 
some of the features like the huge wooden doors at the main entrance of the hotel are amazing 
i had a poor initial impression of the hotel - the receptionist seemed fairly clueless when i checked sending 
nice big rooms 
the only area which needs looking at is the beach 
the service was good and the ambience was spot on 
efficient front desk staff 
beautiful view and two nice restaurants 
great property with excellent guest services 
do n't trust their website and ask to be in the main building 
we prefer modern walk-in showers so did not care for the standard bathtub shower setup 
the food at the restaurant was less than i expected for an hotel of this kind 
why could n't hotel management realise that it was a problem 
the executive lounge was a highlight as the staff there were wonderful and the amenities there were top-not 
wonderful lighting and a good view of the old city 
the bathroom ( average size ) was poor ( bad water pressure and really old shower fittings ) 
the food was excellent and the shabbat dinner was terrific 
nice to have free internet 
it was a hot buffet with ceremonial wine 
the hotel lacks in some common amenities found in other hotels like toiletries and around the clock laundry services 
look to the left at the end of the street and you 'll see the hilton across the 
as we had flown all night and needed sleep during the day beautiful park next door for some exercise and 
rooms were comfortable with free wifi 
but the wardrobe is almost non existent 
we said when we checked out that we were woken up by the noise and the only reaction was 
hotel guests have access to the fitness first black label property which adjoins the hotel and this 
this is subject to my personal opinion - but i like places that respects the classics . 
there is a walk in shower with good hot water flow 
i have written reviews of this hotel before and i wondered if it would live up to my very positive 
and i dont smoke 
whale watching tour was worth every single penny spent 
the pool is huge and well worth a visit 
try and get a room on the park side 
the executive lounge has a good selection of snacks 
the major sights are all within walking distance 
many great f&b outlets near the hotel 
i could hear it with windows closed 
looks good so far with all new furniture in the lobby bar coffee area 
the hotel is in the finance district of the city with many trees and interesting buildings 
double windows 
this hotel is ideally located and well run 
the taxi back to the airport costs around 400dkk one way 
especially hot dishes on both chinese and western styles 
you have to ask for a room closer to the reception otherwise you have to walk a little bit 
bed very comfortable 
but good value for money 
there are many hotels better with similar price in montreal 
lunch in the restaurant was ok but nothing special . 
right smack on top of a beautiful sandy & rocky beach 
the quality of the hotel is world class and exudes a humble approach 
staff seemed friendly but check in and check out wait time could be shortened 
it is on a lovely beach and while yes 
reasonable prices ( drinks ) 
staff is friendly and service is good 
the service is absolutely top notch and the amenities match it in every way 
room is a decent size with good toiletries but unfortunately my room was very noisy on the saturday 
reasonable storage space but shelf and cupboard space limited 
the gym is very good and well equipped 
easy to find with lots of parking and really friendly staff 
we ended up having to leave the windows open but then there was traffic noise 
and the wet areas of the spa perfectly looked after 
we spend 200 nights a year traveling and this resort has exceptional guest rooms 
expected bigger room 
listed below pros and consprosnice poolrooms ok though datedfriendly stafflocated near the river 
great service and great golf 
we got upgraded to a 2600 sq ft villa overlooking the golf coarse and pacific ocean 
the large pool area is spectacular and excellent for families with children 
there are also two amazing 18 hole golf courses if you 're interested in that 
the breakfast buffet is good alsothere are a couple of restaurants in the hotel with kudos 
this is a good business hotel 
even when looking out of the windows of your room you do n't get the natural daylight 
other times they would barely look at you 
they charge for the time you are on the system and not for a 24 hour block like most hotels 
location is good near the causeway bay mtr as well as all the shopping and food options cause 
modern with a double and single bed 
on a couple of occasions i had to wait overly long for coffee and on another it took so long 
great locationnear beautiful times square mall 
the property is very limited as to amenities 
the front desk was not responsive to needs at all 
the 27th floor holds a fantastic lounge-style patio 
and i received an upgrade due to my frequent guest status with the ihg hotel chain 
to have to phone the front desk for a new internet password every 24 hours 
very comfortable overnight stay near airport 
awesome staff and huge rooms for the price 
a leisure ten minute walk to the mascot airport link station could bring you elsewhere in sydney for 
a clean and nice property in the heart of busy hong kong 
although the hotel has a pool it is very tiny and directly besides the bar on the 28th floor 
we visited pullman for one night 
really outstanding property in both quality and service and so close to sydney airport 
high floor racecourse view 
i stay in a lot of hotels and this one is top notch i really cant fault this place its 
the tv system is super annoying - you have to scroll slowly through the channels 
the room was spacious with a king bed and a large bathroom that had both a bath and a se 
breakfast here was sumptuous ( and overseen by a very pleasant and heartily cheerful woman who 
( there are also complementary canapes available too 
large and very busy breakfast area with plenty of choices 
junior suite was very nice and comfortable 
we found that we had to travel into central to find some good bars and restaurants and even found our 
the front desk staff were excellent and with our room not available on our arrival swiftly arranged several drinks in 
a quiet park 
very helpful front desk 
highly recommended . 
very good bathroom 
business hotel in a good location 
shopping is complete along the pedestrian street 
if you 're looking for shiny windows and high rise rooms like the royal meridien 
with good changing facilities which also serve the gym 
there is a nearby golf course that is easily accessible from hotel ( they have a cart to take you 
great spacious swimming pool 
the grand lobby 
this was all made worse by the way the hotel staff treated me - basically like a liar 
given it was a long weekend and very busy we were not given a late checkout and there was a 
food in the buffet is a good selection 
free welcome drinks 
compared to the one in lima this is a far much better hotel 
easy options after a very long day 
the lobby bar is a good hangout after work to relax with a drink and catch some sports on 
the lobby restaurant bar is cold and drafty 
great location 
a great experience in a memorable city and this is a top notch jw 
went around end may to this beautiful city in south peru which is the entry to the famed mach 
our room was slightly small but it had all the amenities one could ask for and the wifi was fast 
we had facials and massages in the spa - wonderful 
while not flawless this is a stunning hotel in a great location close to everything 
being the only true luxury hotel in cusco they could have cut corners and would still be the 
bars and restaurants nearby 
this hotel 's management needs to revisit its emergency planning and remember that the check-out experience is 
close to good shopping and good restaurants 
the lobby is a bit busy and the hotel is rather large ( primarily full of business travelers ) 
huge tv and great view from the upper floor 
the attached bar is reasonable value for money 
the super views over the city from various vantage points were a bonus 
overall not a very pleasant stay experience 
the last time i stayed at a hilton was in 2009 and found the whistler offering to be 
we were looking for the swimming pool and different staff members either could not understand us or just kept telling 
the room was terrific 
very friendly staff in the lounge bar and great atmosphere 
water in shower stayed hot for about 2 minutes 
good value for money if you get an executive room 
whistler lifts 30 seconds away . 
this is a hotel that you should consider staying 
but it 's is american style and a little pricey 
the reception warm &amp 
on other floors it is a paid for cable connection only 
plus this hotel provide free transport going into jumeirah beach park 
compared to other dubai hotels and the generally high price level this hotel is a real bargain 
i condider the hotel good value by dubai standards - and aleays a safe choice 
we were very grateful to be greeted by friendly helpful staff at reception 
car pick up was efficient with a decent anna the receptionist was nice and fast 
poolside rooms are great for cheap entertainment during summer months but noisy at night 
there was separate shower and bathtub 
the hotel has pretty much all you can ask for from a 5 star 
the ceiling hang fan and large sized windows and old wooden floor 
each room has it 's own tank and they were not designed for long hot showers 
very impressive rooms with all the necessary and somewhat unnecessary features you may need nice shower and bathtub but 
very old style historical villa which was earlier used by a communist head of laos after 
wonderful staff 
i thought the pot of welcome tea was a nice touch 
great service - average hotel 
but what seals the deal is their pool and pool area which is beautiful and without a doubt the best 
like front desk 
has a good pool and very good spa 
this lower priced hotel in macau was decent for my 1 night stay 
centrally located and with a great swimming pool 
restaurants and the spa are excellent 
i thought this a little odd as the whole point of the lounge is that special sense of privilege and 
it is a little out of town 
we atayed in hilton barcelona for 4 nights last month 
a morning newspaper and soft towels and decent bathrobes 
and then it is back down to the long lines at reception 
the ground floor lobby bar is big and the service is good 
rooms size were little small but very very clean 
two great swimming pools 
the food and especially the service is outstanding 
a group of us was staying here the rooms were dark here which maybe a trend thing but i have 
check in was quick but front of hotel and lobby was busy with spring breaker 's partying and staying 
but close to the airport 
no clean towels or toiletries are provided 
not my favorite-- by a long shot-- feels a bit rundown and service is very average 
the decor is art deco funky with purple and foil and some interesting fixtures 
a great start for me at reception with adam who was very friendly and very helpful i had a very 
it was great - spacious 
a little dated but well appointedgood outside pool and excellent gymitalian 
used the spa and had a back massage which i can highly recommend - both my husband and i said 
good hotel with nice rooms but there is n't any porters to help you on arrival 
bathroom has an unclean urine smell with stains in the toilet . 
the breakfast room is a box with no real view 
truly a stunning setting over the water 
after confirmation they gave us the right room 
the hotel itself is good bedding 
and parking was expensive at 25 
not the cheapest at 35 for a full buffet but a great range and decent nespresso coffee 
is not located in the old quarter 
for us the second trip will be the last 
there is a small bar attached which is fab for after dinner drinks or coffee 
the fourth floor was very quiet 
the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful 
with great facilities and service ( i 'd elect to stay here over either the sheraton ( next 
we had dinner one night by the pool which was really good 
for the price you 're paying 
the circular lobby 
the bar on the first floor is lit nicely 
we sat by the pool one afternoon which was also clean 
this was a great hotel located at the base of the machu picchu citadel 
with a view up to the town in one direction and toward the ruins in the other 
the downside of the river was the noise and the possibility of mosquitoes but plug in raid was provided 
for a larger resort 
really ace young gentleman that want you to have a good time 
stayed in one of the pool villas - perfectly situated on a narrow strip between the lake and 
the town is a great location to stay before visiting machu picchu 
special kids meals ( without charge ) 
the train runs directly behind this hotels rooms and you hear it from like 7am to 7pm 
and worth the cost 
make sure the room has a view 
i do n't want to mention other standard services that sumaq offer such as assistance from and to 
would stay again . 
the rooms were spacious and clean and had all amenities and the service was top class 
clean tidy rooms and spacious 
situated at one of the best beaches in grand cayman 
they moved us to the other end of the building right next to the building and the hammer drill from 
and every day night we called the front desk 
and smiles ongoing at dinner ( which was delicious ) and breakfast ( which was delicious ) 
being just a short walk from notre dam cathedral and the post office 
the suite was spacious & very comfortable 
the good news is that it this seems to be fairly priced for what it is 
a lovely lunch at the m bar 
it is located right across the road from the saigon river dinner boat docks , and only a 
excellent location next to the opear house with very good transport connections and close to many places 
it was on the top floor with a walk-out but tiny balcony with a great view of the 
there are trams and the underground metro ( u-bahn ) right on your doorstep 
they are currently undergoing renovations but you rarely notice 
we asked for a quiet room and were provided with a pool view which although has no real city view 
the roof top where breakfast is served is fantanstic 
its located in perfect location walk distance from almost everythingthere is only one things that i did n't 
the bathroom was spotless and the shower powerful and hot 
breakfast fare is varied and well - prepared 
then i went back to front desk 
reception was quiet and i 'd already checked-in online so was on my way to the 
somewhat scarcely equipped gym 
but adequate in size 
a short walk to the u-bahn and some of the main sights 
with rain shower and lovely deep bath 
windows in room open 
( our international terminal was last ) you can get caught up in traffic and the driver ca n't 
the spa is excellent 
it would have been easier to just get a taxi outside the terminal to the front door of the hotel 
and while you waiting for your treatment it 's like in a hospital you surrounded with people in bath 
we needed an overnight hotel at the airport for a late arrival flight from europen with and early am 
is it really too much to expect a major brand airport hotel 
solid airport hotel 
) only downside was the incredibly high price for an airport hotel - i paid almost 500 including taxes for 
the villa on the beach front with its heated outdoor pool and beautiful rustic interiors and furnish 
nice bathrooms 
restaurant in the lobby is open late ( although not as late as it could be ) 
good size 
broken drapes and torn linens one would expect at a low end property 
restaurants are great , and i was just so impressed everyone knew your name ! 
having travelled around the world in exclusive hotels 
the lobby is huge and check in was fast and easy 
my wife and i went to the beach and noticed there was no one swimming or lying on the beach 
very convenient for an early flight 
small and dark rooms and uninspiring executive lounge left depressing impression on me 
the convenience of being connected to the airport is great 
being the first marriott property in the city of shanghai opened in early 2000s 
convenient airport hotel 
we were very pleased we had opted for this hotel- it was an easy walk via a bridge 
great location 
a great comfortable bed and a lovely out door seating area 
the pool area was nice 
in terms of on-property dining pineapple grill was our favourite ( resort shuttle will take you there ) 
this is key if you will be taking taxis a lot like we did and do n't want to 
we had to walk around the entire length and width of the pool - would have been much more convenient 
6 ) the secluded beach is amazing 
hopefully not the best in town 
beautiful shower 
the lobby was very bustling and the rooms were spacious and well appointed 
most of the public areas and gardens looked like a bit of a 70 's throwback but it 
the wifi is free and very quick 
gym is well equipped and on the top floor with pool and awesome views 
the free bottles of water in the rooms were a nice touch too 
as an spg gold i asked for a late 2pm checkout 
beware of thin walls 
- rooms are super old and noise proofing is completely absent 
carpet was dirty and old in the corridors 
beds were comfortable and the standard amenities were present 
pros- clean rooms- free internet- well-run boutique hotel- quality for money ( compared 
friendly staff at front desk 
fast internet 
the colours and a friendly face at reception willing to facilitate our first needs 
it 's also a short walk from the lake and old town 
rooms have the kind of bland decor such that if you woke up in the middle of night 
great service 
our room was clean and well appointed and the staff professional 
good service 
both check-in and check-out were swift and pleasant . 
just walk out and one will pull up from the line waiting kerbside 
3 -4star but since we just used our room to sleep and shower and then rest of the 
to the right of reception there is a large area with seating 
for some extra noise not only does the a c unit look like its from the arc it made a 
i just wondered why my room was not made up for a day when i indicated no linen change as 
quite an unmemorable stay i must say 
the staff was very friendly 
good shower and nice towels 
the bed was great 
rooms are modern and haver all facilities one would expect 
we are having a family holiday here at the novotel i could n't recommend it highly 
free wifi and excellent customer service 
probably one of the nicest hotels we stayed in whilst in australia 
there is less noise on the rarefied heights 
a small bar area and lounge and tv- not bad but relatively small room and very average bathroom 
comfy beds bathroom was clean and had all the necessary free items 
the rooms are nice 
coffee is apparently free . 
the hotel is dated and there are much better options around now in sydney 
rooms a bit dated and external noise came into the room 
valet parking was not available and they offered self parking in a nearby car park for 20 for a 
valet parking is a little expensive however there is a secure parking lot 2 mins from the front door 
i spoke with reception the next morning and they went out of their way to help us 
and inside some areas are n't much better 
become an ihg member and you have 30-minute complimentary wifi daily 
the rooms were clean and serviced daily 
the bedroom is noisy though as there is work outside 
would definitely stay again 
and for the price of the rooms in february was great value for money 
large rooms 
the room is spacious with a nice small living room and a big tv 
being build into an old warehouse in the city centre makes this hotel already very interesting and far more appealing 
location dark 
we were able to eat at several top restaurants in the city because the concierge expertly handled 
we found beautiful streets square churches and restaurants with excellent dinning and music 
as our room was being checked to see if it was ready we sat in the lobby and was offered 
my wife also very much enjoyed the freshly made omelettes 
we came from narita airport and emailed the concierge our tickets and they were waiting in front 
the outside corridor is elegantly decorated using white as the color theme which i am not sure how long 
the rooms are nice and decor was great 
rooms are quite comfortable and our standard room included a reasonable sized patio with table and chairs that provided an 
being able to get the narita express from the airport direct to the station and then go upstairs to 
it is worse in the first floor apparently 
over- rated with very poor customer service 
i called the front desk to have someone collect my laundry 
wifi was better than previous visits 
the bar is good too and the spiced cashew nuts are nice 
cannot say the same for the pillows 
very comfortable but not luxury - some things were old or broken 
front desk okay but seemed to be struggling under coach parties corporate event request 
i 'm always wary when i walk into a hotel bedroom which smells of air freshener and 
the indoor heated pool is a decent size and warm and the large jacuzzi is even warmer 
the pool area is has stunning views but there are so many crows from sunrise to sunset that you 
this design of the hotel brings back the glory of the british empire when they were the colonial 
i was fortunately upgraded to a junior suite which had a massage chair in it - which was great after 
the location is perfect and the hotel sports a wonderful restaurant that is under-rated 
the restaurant is uniquely designed like a glass house & makes one feel like dining with royalty 
wired internet connection was available but cost 22 a day 
i arrived at the hotel very early in the morning ( 0500 ) and was greeted with a very 
water would splash upto the pot and wet the areas next to the tub and would fall on my 
internet is free 
bar was good 
rooms are immaculately clean with all the usual facilities you expect 
check in was fast and easy as was checkout 
we 've stayed at pretty much every lv strip hotel and the cosmopolitan surely ranks up at 
hotel lost my laundry for 24 hours but ended up finding it and then not charging me for the 
dont stay here during conferences loud plumbing noise i booked this hotel because our national conference suggested it . 
the bed was comfy and the bathroom featured a large spa tub and separate very large shower 
so having only one person at the front desk was not good management 
as a marriott platinum i was able to use the premium check-in area and i was upgraded 
very helpful and knowledgeable reception staff who explained which buses to catch to golden gate bridge and separately golden gate 
this is one of the newest hotels in the strip and it shows 
clean bathroom - smallish but adequate 
the hotel is a bit tired and the walls between the room let a bit of noise through 
full size hair dryer 
its an old building 
henry 's is a good spot for breakfast 
check in room for platinum guests is a nice idea 
the suite had a good solid work desk 
reasonably priced hotel with good reviews 
free coffee in reception is a great idea 
professional and friendly staff 
and the hotel was able to contact an inhouse doctor nearby at 1am in the morning for me 
there was no air-conditioning in the room and no need for it since it was cool enough 
the property is very well maintained and run 
the food is very mediocre and terribly disappointing given the price one pays per dish 
especially from the outdoor balcony terrace ( although very hot on a summer 's night ) 
literally a 1 min walk which was great as we flew up from london stayed and picked up a 
from the huge check-in check-out queues that keep you waiting in line for an hour just 
very pricey but good location and servicd 
asked for two glasses of generic rioja . 
the windows do a great job of keeping the noise out from outside 
decent bathroom although it is a quite a big step down when you get out of the bath 
the spa massages were a great experience 
( it is the topmost floor of the borei angkor resort and spa ) 
the food was fantastic and the waiters excellent 
it is in a lovely setting in an outside area all lit with candles and was one of the highlights 
with a fair bit of space - but similar to other rooms we have had on our travels in the 
btw a starbucks is just around the corner in the shopping mall next to the hotel 
good shower 
check-out is very swift too except the concierge is not attentive on guests needing their service 
breakfast is lovely 
above paragon mall 
flight cancelled and was expecting another tired airport hotel for the unscheduled overnight stay 
the menu is fairly extensive with indonesian and western options available 
the parking is also on chargeable basis 
i use it as the airport hotel for munich 
this happenned twice and the rest of the staff just looked on giggling 
they provided free wifi in all hotel areas 
spent a very nice two nights here on business 
the gran via is literally a straight 10 min walk up the road 
nit has a indoor 20m pool 
very clean and the bed was very comfortable 
good swimming pool 
this may be a bit difficult for travelers on foot but the parking is also expensive at this property ( 
the rooms are nice but need some paint touch ups and maintenance issues addressed 
the staff were very helpful 
when the renovations are complete i think it will have the best eating and bar areas of any of the 
stay in this hotel for 2 nights because i 've to attend a conference near disneyland resort 
this was a very nice hotel 
was pleasantly surprised the cafe is next to the swimming pool 
also a little out of town 
family suites only have 1 window in the entire room 
perfect business hotel 
better options exist outside the park boundaries 
the location is great 
its like being in vegas 
the main lodge building felt like something out of the 1950s 
and two full bathrooms 
nobu is good and the hotel staff generally friendly - particularly one lady concierge 
the hotel itself is right on the 150m beach with beautiful gardens surrounding it 
my room however was quiet on the building next to the pool 
comforters and pillows all fresh and clean and very comfortable 
guam was interesting to visit for about a week 
japanese hotels are typically drab and overpriced places where you must go to sleep but where 
the bay and beach are stunning and calm 
the hotel is located near hakata station just steps from transportation 
the staffs are very friendly and efficient 
thank you so much to the team and the management 
tastefully decorated with antiques artfully presented 
wanted to try the sauna in the hotel and was told need to pay entry fees which is 
stayed only one night in a grand deluxe room but would have liked to stay for more 
the quality of the rooms are ok and the staff are well trained 
this is the kind of building you often find yourself paying to wander round 
the gardens are gorgeous and the overall attention to detail throughout the property is extraordinary 
they have ponds that are packed with fish and turtles . 
beautiful property in stunning location a fine , substantial resort hotel with impressive golf credentials and loads of facilities 
it was dark and we had to park the car right outside the entrance of the hotel at a small 
the lobby was nice and the people were nice 
as such the best chairs are blocked by 8am- this should not be allowed 
not possible to even walk to the bogor raya golf course though part of the complex 
its been done up since we were here last year and it is fabulous a great addition to the hotel 
we were located in a spacious bedroom with an ensuite bathroom with shower 
we also had high tea one day and that was served with real clotted cream and unlimited scones 
deseo is a more casual dining option but the quality of food and service are excellent 
we had our evening meal in the golf club restaurant which was good with excellent service 
the shower is not really practical as it was so close to the wall you could not shower your whole 
the food is great 
nothing exceptional for the price 
the spa is amazing too 
breakfast the first day was very busy and a buffet was offered 
definitely worth a visit 
try to take the sea-view rooms on high floors for the nice view 
however lots of minor niggles 
the bathroom was large 
room excellent with jacuzzi 
no spa or pool but overall a comfortable stay 
the bed is fantastic and everything is very clean 
rooms are good but more luxurious amenities would have been welcome for that price 
however you get what you pay for and the location and exceptional service make it very worthwhile 
make sure to check out the roof top pool as well 
room is small and dated with noise from street but comfortable with good selection of bathroom amenities 
i had the opportunity to see two days during our stay there . 
an ipad that controls everything ( and also has access to great city guides ) 
rather chaotic as the staff were just overwhelmed by the guests surrounding them 
free wifi 
this hotel is very nice and its restaurants seem to be a hot spot for locals 
the price of a beer and cocktail at the pool was silly high 
we had a foot massage in the hotel spa , this was world-class and was not 
we were able to walk pretty much to all the places we wanted to go to ( albeit sometimes my 
the area has been beautifully done up and offers visitors a great selection of dining and accommodation with the more 
but there is a wonderful work out facility in place 
minibar ( non-alcoholic drink ) and the so call lounge located right next to the 
pachanga and bice bars were nice 
it 's a very modern hotel 
pool attendants are really good over sun beds 
nice and quiet with good pool facilities 
standard over the bath showers and the bathrooms are pretty small 
this made driving to the hotel tricky as so many streets were closed off 
the location of the hotel is perfect for getting around bangkok because the bts station is around the 
free wifi for all marriott members 
you would have to be a really difficult customer if you werent pleased with your stay 
our room 721 had a generous size 
5 min walk to car hire ( we caught taxi to and from airport and then hired a car ) 
there was hardly room to move let alone store our suitcases 
there is a basement car park which they charge 25 for which seems a bit cheeky seeing as you 
this courtyard property will certainly be rated above other previous experiences elsewhere 
central location and great room 
the rooms are large and have great amenities like huge plasma tv and comfortable king-size bed 
and close to metro station ( 5 min walk ) 
gym is nice and overall service is good 
great for us as we were outside hotel most of the weekend so this provided easy flybys for food 
large bathroom and amenities 
while we decided to take our breakfast downstairs due to the larger selection 
it 's a hotel not as fancy but ok for a night stay . 
if you have to use an airport hotel 
it has well equipped fitness centre and pool is a good size for a city centre hotel 
at night time there are many food stalls outside on the main street 
the staff was friendly 
on the days we did come back early we just parked a few streets back ( which was free ) 
good location 
the kitchenette is great for a studio room - even though we did n't need to use it 
decent breakfast 
hotel location was superb 
clean and contemporary hotel 
there are two computers in the business centre but you have to ask front desk for password and they will 
and a 20 - 30 min walk to the old town - or a short taxi-ride ( see 
there are many top restaurants just a few steps away from the hotel and the view of the bay is 
and a beautiful lobby 
but was a nice treat 
this is a grand hotel 
it was looking very dated for a while but i 'm glad that the refurbishment has brought back 
cheese and to top it off champagne 
i did n't even open it but anyhow check your billed when checking out 
very nice hotel 
internet access is a major flaw 
make sure you request a ground floor room so you get the bath 
i told them the mark hopkins across the street had a room ready and we would go over there 
public facilities are very good 
wonderful panorama when the mist had n't rolled in 
we walked all over town and the location is nice because it is quieter when compared to the bustle 
rooms on the beach are excellent 
you will have a wonderful stay 
oh the only thing i would say is they need firmer pillows hehehe too soft for 
superb condition and good value 
so book this resort now - you wo n't be disappointed 
ask for a close room - we were situated in a 2nd floor room over looking the lagoon 
with fantastic ocean views 
the location is fantastic 
the location is great if your interest is in visiting beale street 
the bedroom is large consisting of a king size bed 
i told him that was a little further than i wanted to walk right at the moment and was there 
high floor front facing 
i booked a premier room in the new wing with a harbour view according the website 
the internet access is only through cable ( it means no internet for cell phones ) and if one does 
little charm 
and for the price i felt it was equivalent to other more expensive hotels in the marina bay zone 
i happen to love older grander hotels with a little bit of edge 
easy checked in and out . 
great for your overnight phone charge 
parking was free for in-house guests 
we were looking for a relaxed holiday at a city and good hotel which was fully accomplished 
perhaps the worst drawback were the long waits at the taxi line outside the lobby 
nice bathroom and shower 
with free wifi 
and the pool was decently sized 
it was a little out of town but certainly not far and after staying in yallingup for 1 
staff main desk were cheerful and courteous 
lots of plugs available to charge your gadgets and wifi is free 
next to raffles and with metro stations nearby 
the staff are excellent and helpful 
the toilet is clean and was brightly lighted 
nice location but a bad experience 
stayed in the old building even though the new building was in the picturesno free wi-f 
toilets were also of average quality 
i was very impressed with the lovely room and bathroom 
although i have to say the rate does n't reflect the standard of the hotel - far too expensive 
the amenities were great 
l'occitane bath products and awesome kohler tub with seperate rain shower 
why do they charge extra for the net 
the pool was cold 
the bed was super king sized one 
if it was sit on the table and order - then the lounge was short staffed for surepoor vegetarian 
it is also very close to bandra which has a great choice of interesting and trendy restaurants and bars 
this is a great hotel to stay in istanbul the location is very central at taksim 
from the foyer to your room 
little pricey like all 5 stars so having a loyalty card helpssome pieces of mutton little che 
i wish they had free shuttle to taksim 
i had a chance to observe the general manager ( peter ) at work inspecting the lounge every morning 
tiny bathroom 
3 minutes walk to the taksim metro station and a leisurely 15 minutes walk thru a park 
my room had a nice balcony overlooking the courtyard 
elsewhere they try to stealthily increase their meters and overcharge you - but i digress 
and gave us clean towels every day 
average property with a good staff 
oasis of calm in a mad city 
great location though 
by refurbishing rooms and public areas would really hit the spot 
the room itself is very nice and very comfortable 
it is a typical hyatt property and by that i mean high quality 
the lobby was beautiful 
we stayed on the club floor which was fantastic with full breakfast and light snacks available during the evening 
it 's an old building that has been maintained reasonably well - comfortable but missing modern air con controls 
however the view from the lobby is spectacular 
marriott in goa is a decent property at miramar beach 
having a keurig coffeemaker and real cream in the room is a very nice touch 
we used the hotel courtesy bus to the airport for our domestic flight departure and return 
food is really good and i thought very fairly priced 
i would have booked the beach front room from the start 
the property is very close to the sea and we took a suite so it was the best view and 
our room and bathroom are very spacious and the amenities were topnotch 
bed is very comfy and huge bathroom with all the amenities you need 
it is very accessible to shopping 
try the lamb burger but best to avoid the bunny chow option 
the room was a little dark but no great issue 
the rooms look horribly dated 
the staff are all very good and especially aware of safety 
i have been to other hotel in manila which charges less 
the area is close to the convention centre and great if you are there for a convention 
front desk staff and breakfast staff very kind and service minded 
we enjoyed using the nespresso coffee maker and the delicious welcome desserts 
overall i think there 's better value hotels close by 
the room was spacious and comfortable 
i did not like the bathroom as it only had a shower but the main room was spacious and the 
although make sure you work out where you are going as it is a big station with lots of exits 
the hotel and location are probably worth considering for a short trip 
legendary hotel lives up to reputation 
not only that but that but the meal - particularly , my steak which was tender and cooked to 
- note on taxi 's- all very cheap ( 5 will get you most places ) the rooms 
the bathroom is luxurious and the colour palette was very elegant 
the bathroom is nicely kitted out 
a very good hotel that ticks all the boxes 
it is pure luxury in a victorian style 
i was joking that they were probably trained to make small talk with american tourists because we like that 
they made a special trip downstairs to accomodate my request 
good business hotel ! 
the lobby is small but has a nice cafeteria outside bear the front door and nice in the winter only 
on my way out i found the same duty manager ( mr abass i think ) and pointed 
typical buffet breakfast needs only minimal table service and there were a lot of people milling around 
but we could order food at the bar and room service breakfast was excellent 
i stayed in ritz carlton for 2 nights and the stay was wonderful 
the lobby is tired and is lit like and airport 
executive corner suites on high floor 
there is a lovely swimming pool 
the hotel staff was nice and called one by surname 
the room itself was fine though it had no views 
such as a separate tub and shower 
arrived just in time for a quick shower and headed straight out to dinner so did n't really 
bed feels impressively comfortable and linens are top-notch 
i needed a hotel for a late arrival and early departure 
the bathroom was large and complete with a roll top bath which also had a view of the lake 
you had to dig around in the mini bar area for a glass just to get a drink of tap 
excellent food 
one bedroom suite with water views at the very least water view room 
this may be the best place in town but it still needs a bit of extra help to meet expectations 
but was really disappointed when i figured out that only pop-corn and bad quality potato snacks ( pr 
the beds very cosy 
it 's situated a little out of town 
the hotel is typical hilton but good friendly service excellent breakfast buffet i had a garden lake front room 
the staff were very helpful and the position was good 
all wooden floors are newly polished 
taxis are plentiful in this city and i think there is a subway to the airport 
the bathroom floor gets quite wet when the shower is used 
the bedroom with a super comfortable bed and indulgent pillow menu is on the second level 
gas fireplace ( not necessary because queenstown were having a heat wave ) 
one of the concierges directed me to a very expensive car when i looked for a taxi one 
we liked the decor and the modern furniture though one of our group found the furnishing a bit dark 
i find the hotel satisfactory although it has already aged 
i asked her to arrange some transport the next day for me and my colleagues and she arranged this seamlessly 
the rooms were warm and the temperature was easily controlled 
the gym opens 24 7 and it has lots of equipments for one to enjoy 
with wifi and two comfy chairs 
5 minutes later the same dishes were returned 
hotel breakfast was 33 eur pp ( too much even for a great buffet ) so we found 
at night it is wise to open a window rooms get very warm and the ac makes some nois 
the pool is nice enough with amazing views across the lake ( which had buffalo and crocs in it 
i paid 18 euros for broadband wireless and then found that there was no signal in the restaurant area and 
it has got the best free wi-fi reception in sri lanka ( after 3 
the beach looks great ( too dangerous to swim at this time of the year ) and the lagoon 
old luxury ambience surrounds you 
our room was huge and very comfortable 
the house cocktail was a good way of forgetting the earlier annoyance 
the staff were all excellent and the food we had was a very good standard 
the greeting and help from reception top drawer and the room and bathroom exactly what you would expect from a 
the latter is excellent with several dishes not encountered at other buffets during our tour 
the breakfast buffet is huge and delicious 
nice walking city and the subway system is very easy to navigate 
very good business hotel 
the shower was great 
this room is much more spacious than the previous room and the bathroom is more spacious 
each room is only given two small bottles of drinking water which is not sufficient 
the second one was meant to be a birthday surprise so i called the hotel before in order to 
small pool 
room service menu is as good as expected 
if we thought the restaurant was expensive 
the hotel has a small but very nice pool and pool area and a terrace that over looks the 
i like the high bar table especially when i was working on my lap top 
the pool is also very nice specially on the new wing 
the beach is beautiful with little shacks reminding us of how koh samui was some 20 years 
the amorita manager gave us a complimentary dinner the next night- better cooked grilled seafood 
beds and pillows very comfy 
after years of travelling and staying at special resorts 
it is a quiet area and we felt quite safe 
the staff is impeccable 
the main train station just 15 minutes away as is the metro if you want to venture further out 
further in the room there was a wardrobe with a safe 
food is amazing and a lot better than restaurants in manila 
wine and beer and other drinks are expensive 
not the end of the world but after a full day hiking around the small streets that extra half km 
in a small street that runs parallel to the impressive avenida liberdale 
the bar is a very relaxed place for a late evening cocktail 
nice property 
it is a short walk to the centre and very close to the bus stop for a sightseeing tour 
i think what sets apart this hotel is that you get a lot for a decent price 
the common-area and dining-room vibe is very holiday inn 
the fridge had a bag of tostitos left over from the previous guest and there were candy 
brown furnishings and brown wallpaper 
the bathroom seems recently renovated so that was a nice touch 
or a short walkthe best was however the rooms and the staff its one of the cleanest hi 
recommended for people who want value and overall very good quality without being fancy 
all i could suggest is hotel indoor swimming pool and sauna massage 
nthe service was great 
i confess to getting a little teary 
and plenty of food options nearby 
parking is available with extra charge 
because our flight landed very late and we wanted to crash near the airport before moving on to our beach 
staff were generally very efficient with good rooms 
the denver lodo ( lower downtown ) district is easy to reach 
also walls are thin so you can hear corridor and your neighbours 
with basic amenities ( no shower cap ) 
very comfortable bedding 
it shares facilities with intercontinental next door and the pool areas are very nice and very well maintained 
all up a great business hotel with more to offer than most at a reasonable price 
it offers an adequate selection of shops and restaurants like a hypermart 
look at the hotel website to choose the room decor you like 
i found even the fastest wifi to be rather slow at times 
the hotel is nice 
it has a nice bar and good size pool 
ask to stay on a high floor preferably the 7th club floor 
a free shuttle service to and from the airport 
check-in was efficient and we were given the code for complimentary internet access in the room ( consistent 
hotel has a nice pool 
siva and bandula go out of the way to make the vacation memorable 
an awesome destination and great value with your points 
the menu varied over the three days we were there with asian 
which are all top notch and highly recommended 
just spent a short night with my wife prior to an early flight 
with everything required but paying a much more attractive price 
the hotel is close to the airport 
it should be free for the guests but you have to pay 3 pounds each way 
when reaching the room i couldnt open the door with my keys 
we very much enjoyed the big and comfortable bathroom as well as the comfortable couch in the living room 
pretty jardti get taxi during peak hour but the hotel offers shuttle service to major sopping malls 
excellent bed 
the restaurant with outdoor seating is lovely 
the front desk always have a great smile 
- rooms and amenities are very good 
sleeping quality good 
i called reception and their reply was huh 
the pool is good with nice areas to lounge around in 
freindly staff and a clean property 
and again frustrated that we paid top dollar for our stay here however must always pay extra for other am 
although the property is very nice 
perhaps the owner estimates it more profitable to reduce all these costs for make money than take care of 
it is a lovely property 
random staff walked right by me in the lobby areas ( with no one else nearby ) and mout 
meaning checking out and getting to station is actually better than getting to hotel 
the british concierge is a wonderful resource - he knows his way around tokyo 
staffs at the lounge and restaurants were extremely nice and prefessional 
it actually occupies the top floors 
breakfast was expensive but there are so many options nearby 
with an iconic building ( one57 57th st ) and a uber modern finish 
ask for a room with view of tokyo tower - great 
beautiful upper floor lobby 
the service is true to a park hyatt 
our room overlooked the beautiful harbour and gardens and facilities were excellent 
there are metro stations nearby 
bars and restaurants near the train station along the track bridge which is about 5 minute walk 
breakfast buffet is as you 'd expect in any serious international hotel and service from staff is splendid 
the breakfeast and the dinner were served in a newly restored area 
this is a great hotel - spanking clean 
i have stayed several times at cliveden in recent years 
we left a booking request for a room and private hire of one of the launches 
the lounge area adjacent to reception is a joy to behold with its superb wood panelling and fine d 
stepping into the tub one needs to be very careful 
it was a suite with a marble fireplace and separate bedroom 
dinner at the former terrace dining room ( after a much needed renovation ) is a must 
this hotel has very limited amenities 
nothing was to much trouble and you felt that throughout the staff wanted to do everything they can to make 
an exceptional property 
with the beautiful atrium that went up to the triangular glass roof 
my first room had a strong odor which belied the fact that the plumbing also needs attention 
park hotel sits on the higher floors of the new shiodome media center while below it lies the 
the jr station is slightly complicated to reach if you go underground 
less great from our hotel room 
with christmas mood , we spent the rest of the day to walk around and enjoy the lights 
quite a trendy boutique style hotel 
amazing location - just outside of the city 
the hotel bar is worth a visit 
with old cobble streets etc 
the window is floor to ceiling so offers great views 
a privacy roller blind is provided in the bathroom if needed 
nice roof top pool and gym friendly and easy check in and check out 
by the way the local precinct is now home to many great restaurants and bars too - all walking distance 
it 's fine but overpriced with plenty of better competitive and more current hotels nearby 
location is good with a plethora of restaurants in close proximity and james street close by 
facilities very good pool 
complimentary wifi facility is available 
valet car service good but no free parking around 
no frills hotel that offers the budget traveler great value at a reasonable cost 
making the rooms comfortable and functional at the same time 
lots of choices for restaurants and for those who want to use the kitchen facilities there is a supermarket 
their are lovely restaurants nearby for breakfast or dinner 
very nice hospitality before and during our stay from the hotel 
this is one of the best hotels 
good location - but you 'll have to drag your luggage up some steps 
this property is a let down to the chain 
perhaps due to intense competition from the newer hotels in bangalore 
wifi is free of charge and works in the whole hotel 
functional with all the amenities you can expect and with a tasteful scent 
wittenbergplatz u-bahn station hub is just minutes away by foot as well- 
my wife enjoyed the pool and the staff were patient and professional 
they have 2 parking one outdoor and another one under ground 
clean with good furnishing 
the tasteful decor 
it is located on old airport road with close proximity to business places like mg road 
a very short walk from central railway station and the bus stops for murrays 
on arriving from international flight at 6am was informed not open till 7 
they smell old 
travelodge is situated just a short walk to southbank 
the room was super and the view of the trains very soothing 
very much the same as all the others but in a great location and minutes walk from all the bars 
however it 's location is superb 
the furniture is cheap ikea style and not very desirable for any better taste but well survivable 
there is super fast internet for 2 per 20mins in the foyer which is convenient 
good location good experience 
the price i paid for a friday night was better than most 3 hotels on the same night 
so many shops around and nice porridge cafes are just opposite the hotel 
spacious bathrooms and super-friendly ( even by victorian standards 
the bathrooms were clean 
the location is great 
the night market is also just across the road and going to mongkok to shop is also nearby 
there are several cheap eateries across the road and a convenience store where beers wine and soft drink can 
really nice new motel conveniently located with friendly staff and fairly priced 
check out also the happy hour at the lounge every evening which is reasonably priced and totally enjoyable 
with a full kitchen and a washing machine dryer 
15 minutes to the railway station - with plenty of secure parking 
buffet breakfast was very good offering a full range of western and asian foods and the hotel furnish 
set just off george street dunedin 's main shopping thoroughfare up a steep drive 
the potential only negative the bathroom could have had a stronger fan whilst showering 
with lovely sunny pool 
some prefer baths but the shower was excellent with good pressure 
preferred to stay here than causeway bay hk side . 
which was also top notch 
private pool 16 meter 
there is not much to do outside the resort with kids but it is very relaxing and the perfect place 
true the prices are not low end 
and spa reception are located 
perfect for a romantic quiet trip 
unappealing hot food selection ( scrambled eggs were terrible ) 
its a bit of a walk to the old main square but easy to do on a nice day 
i paid the same price both nights 
a great place to stay 
the gym is really small and the equipment is old 
the hotel feels like a standard haunt for politicians and every time one goes there 
a special praise for their housekeeping staff who equipped the washroom with all toiletries and were pleasing 
this is the perfect business hotel in a non touristy city 
located in nathan road this is a nice hotel to stay solo or with family 
free of charge 
cheap modern furniture 
but within fairly easy walking distance of the city centre 
keep on charging you for things you have already paid for 
but at check in we were upgraded to a lovely marina front suite with a spacious balcony 
one of my favourite hotels in cairns but the room location will have a huge impact on how 
an uninspiring pool and rooms like in an american chain hotel 
car parking with the hotel is chapter than parking it yourself so go the valet option 
if you hold a membership card with higher level you can use a small lounge and a nice fully equipped 
the cairns shangri-la hotel was in a good city ( town ) location 
there was a rundown feeling throughout with damaged walls and scuffed carpets 
but the wish to soak in the culture instead of getting the usual super city experience made me choose the 
all the big and little extras were there including large plasma televisions in both our lounge and super- 
but that 's ok as they are not big and the shower makes better sense 
go for the horizon club floor - the rooms are bigger and the price difference nominal 
the first time was less than stellar and i guess our mumbling must have been heard as when we 
bathroom is nice but nothing to go on about 
being on nathan road just a short walk from jordan mtr 
i was told i could do it online using their free wifi at reception 
but it could have been so much better with some small touches like cushions on the balcony furniture and 
my fourth stay at this property over a 9 month period 
nbeside the small lounge on the level 15 
hotel buffet breakfast was good as my deal came with free breakfast 
the room is on a higher floor and there is a separate lounge area which is used for breakfast and 
they have a nice swimming pool just next to the lobby 
we ate at both the restaurant and the bar and the food was good with a range of menu choices 
buy an octopus card at the airport which is good for trains 
the location is good and i have a very good rest in novotel after running the transl 
the room was a good size for hong kong 
the car park is terribly poorly maintained and the driveway will need extra caution 
the bathroom and shower were very good and spotlessly clean 
noticed that it keeps the same renaisannce themed deco as the one in kuala 
this hotel actually is n't bad 
slim pickings . 
for an international hotel 
ample of facilities for the vacation especially for the kids . 
overall room was comfortable 
the resort is very peaceful and well maintained 
it is a huge property 
great conference facilities 
the room is very big and the resort is very comfortable 
is also nice - big and spacious 
but the bungalows were definitely much larger than those at le meridien and moana and 
we thought that the resort 's facilities were great - the gardens were well tended 
we stayed here some 9 years ago and that time the whole property was smaller 
pool and beach ate nice but there are better in phuket 
bosphorus room in the old palace building recommended 
the tour is great and lunch at the sister property was very good 
the housekeeping staff was prompt and helpful - when we complained about the hard mattress they put an extra 
when i complained about street noise due to the room location 
or observing a european couple checking in for one night paying 800 euros for a room ( already 
very special place to visit 
the spa is also fabulous 
the pool and the club around finishes every busy day 
- good room- cleanness- great breakfast buffet- location is good 
the cocktails were lovely - as good as i have had anywhere and the waiters choice of wine was 
great hotel except aircon issue 
i am attaching a picture of my very tasty mezze platter lunch 
whether it 's front desk 
i can say there are several hotels in the same area with lower price and better view 
it was during ramadan - so the hotel had a very impressive and delicious buffet outside in the evenings 
no complaints . 
this is rare to have this kind of presence in a big hotel 
and i expect much better value at this level 
the front desk and concierge service is commendable 
separate from the shower area 
my first visit to cape town and i was not dissapointed 
the large balcony had 2 sun loungers and 2 chairs 
we did n't bother trying after 2 attempts always found the area always full 
rooms and beds excellent 
i got access to the executive lounge with delicious food and good cocktails during the happy hour 
separate bedroom 
bed is very comfortable and shower was hot 
3 . 
the club suite can be great value for money 
the breakfast buffet and the evening bar service right on the water is wonderful 
boutiques and specialty stores and is about a 5 minute walk away - turn right when you walk 
and the buffet breakfast was excellent 
it is reasonable size room with great facilties 
the set menu for the dinner was tasty but the portions small 
room and bathroom was large but more importantly 
comfortable modern hotel 
try for a top floor room at the end of a corridor 
the buffet breakfast was excellent 
while the krasnye holmy may not be a true 5 star in providing the over the 
2nd floor breakfast was all perfect 
this is a really nice resort a few kilometres outside of kingscliff 
noise was a serious issue first night and recommend getting a higher floor 
perfect city hotel i have stayed here more than 10 times and without exception everything is virtually flawless . 
the pool area is pleasant with adequate pool side seating and sun beds 
room tastefully decorated 
never seemed to be the right temperature 
i would suggest dining outside the hotel where possible 
cheap juices you get from a 3 star hotel 
the hotel lobby is great 
this is one of the nicer hilton hotels i 've stayed in 
this hotel certainly does n't live up to the hilton branding and is in urgent need of modern 
i guess it really depends on the therapist you are allocated 
you get morning light and the views are regal 
good spa 
even for an airport hotel 
although within a minute or so of the call the shower and sink hot water got hot 
i am a marriott rewards member for many years now and am ashamed of the poor services 
it still has a great value 
the swimming pool is lovely 
this area is full of towers and this hotel price comoared to the others considered a cheap one 
this was my 3rd stay ( last one was kinda 2 years back though ) 
a very elegant property with great views 
so it tended to be peaceful once you ducked indoors from the busy street outside 
there is a lovely bar poolside complete with hookah pipes 
free wifi 
corner suites are bigger and have nice big windows 
it reminds me of some really cool hotels in the meat packing area of nyc 
but it may be my fault for expecting more out of such a historic property 
from desk is pleasant but the main issue is the hotel is sub standard 
the twin towers just around the corner and a night life area nearby also 
it backs onto a main road of the village and the railway line 
the old building 
the food and ambience was great 
this well-run national park hotel is a solid historic inn with minimal trimmings 
very nice relaxing stay 
the only downside is that checkin is likely to go slow 
it is a short walk to bukit bintang ( shopping ) 
the mini mart across the road was great for supplies and the staff were very nice 
service was excellentbuffet was average - no particular stand out iteminternet access is always a bone 
close to the universal studio . 
as others have mentioned the amenities are really poor for a five star hotel 
bit of a musty smell and the bathrooms are very dark 
fridge in a kitchenette with even full equipment if you wished to cook 
the room , the room service , food and facilities all together . 
hotel michael is centrally located with a short walk to merlion 
no free wifi2 
if you stay there you like how luxury it is and how large it is 
so posh and luxurious setting 
typical thai hospitality 
the one good thing is the service was not bad 
the floor is highly polished inlaid marble 
the rooms are large but surprisingly lack basic amenities like an ironing board which is the norm is these 
the rooms are a decent size with plenty of power sockets and good wifi speed 
a classic modern business hotel - anonymous clinical and very clean 
this is in serious need of renovation . 
very much enjoyed the four seasons biltmore . 
amazing property with great comfort 
and all the amenities are first class 
i did have a massage and the spa is very nice 
the breakfast was elaborate but preparation needs improvement especially the south indian items on the menu 
this is a beautiful property that has a great deal of charm and the attention to detail was outstanding 
spoilt only by the addition of an 18 service charge and then a tab left open for grat 
from front desk 
tennis courts are great as are the 2 pool areas one of which is across the road at the 
so it is easy access 
there is beautiful landscaping throughout 
it has lovely gardens 
minibar and safe 
what makes this place though as with all great hotels was the staff 
but i digress- the hotel remains my first choice in vancouver for its overall quality and service 
great prices 
the furniture was old and tired 
this was overcome by excellent design and a high quality fit out 
next time , i 'll try one of the other high end hotels in dc . 
the shared roof terrace is a great bonus - colleagues and i shared a bottle of wine and watched 
the location is excellent 
well run hotel has the best position for those wanting an easy walk to many great restaurants and the added 
a spacious bathroom 
with the help of amy at the front desk 
intimate property like this where i 'm taken care of than in some monstrous hotel 
room was nicely decorate and big 
the bed was uncomfortable and pillows too thin 
hence low supply high prices 
standard rooms are a decent size 
the front lobby and housekeeping staff were very helpful and room service arrived in record speed 
the convenience of the rear entrance cannot be overstated 
the location is absolutely perfect 
my husband and i stayed a total of 4 nights this past november at the cape grace 
who in turn gave us free champagne 
the location is just outside of district 1 but we walked to 
it is possible to walk into the city 
this service provision would be adequate for a business traveller staying for a day or two but for my wife 
shops and restaurants are nearby 
great bars and restaurants to visit 
hotel is located on the river bank and it is about 10 min walk along the river to the 
the bed was a double 
large master bath off of the bedroom and small wc near entryway 
we would highly recommend choosing this hotel as it offers excellent value and very high standards and would certainly stay 
- very noisy air conditioner that was so bad had to turn it off to sleep- mattress so 
however the only problem i experienced was with housekeeping - they forgot to replenish the washcl 
large comfortable bed with fresh duvets & pillows 
the quality is the same and service is slow in both establishments but that is cape town in general 
management should do something about making the beach more usable like the nearby shangrila 
what a wonderful hotel in a great location 
in the public areas 
but again - they manage to keep all sorts of guests happy 
and the area is as safe as it can get in sa 
the beach cabanas are nice with small yard but more expensive 
families with small children might want to consider one of the rooms with a private plunge pool though so 
their roof top bar is exceptional with great view of vegas strip and they do have nice finger food 
indian or lebanese restaurants - just perfect 
the pool is good 
the mandalay bay is great just for its excellent pools where you can enjoy a day in the 
another upmarket hotel with a massive casino and lots to do 
plain rooms and ordinary food - but then the other options in wollongong are not that much 
we had a view up the strip-outside pool areas nice and variety with things to do eg wave 
c grill was great for dinner 
this hotel was selected for a last minute business trip and there were very few hotels left 
the servers at breakfast were friendly and attentive 
value wise it was worth it in comparison to places around charging similar 
around 11pm to check in for one nite 
the swimming pool is a salt water pool 
old is gold decent place . 
breakfast has a good spread and taste wonderful 
as i mentioned before you must visit the taj salon for a good head massage 
we enjoyed several dishes but the highlights were the poo nim pham prik ( think that 
the hotel amrath amsterdam is one of the most impressive architectural hotel developments in europe in 
breakfast buffet included in room rate has plenty of options to meet all forms of traveler needs and there 
the concierge very helpful 
lovely hotel rooms adequate and warm 
the bed was comfortable the bathroom was absolutely beautiful 
it is a drag to reach from the airport and return back . 
mine ( 407 ) was a 'dog-leg' shape with a small bedroom area ( large by 
the pool and sauna were nice since it was very cold while we were there but the hot tub 
food and beverage was good and staff very attentive as would be expected at this price point 
clean modern warm spacious with big windows so that we could enjoy the scenery outside 
nothing really wrong and at the right price it is not a bad choice 
going back to the elevators and the awful system 
checking in was on 70th floor and was very busy during all star weekend but was managed well 
we did n't hear too much outside noise and hardly any hallway noise 
the service is pretty much awesome but some individuals are clearly unfamiliar with intercontinental standards 
the lounge got too crowded and the staff seemed to struggle to keep the place from being too much like 
front desk and housekeeping 
the service is just great 
but a higher floor definitely had more natural light 
however there is a decent walk if you want to get to some of the iconic sights but that 
the staff were friendly at the hotel 
just off the grand canal and easy to walk everywhere 
the beds are great 
not good enough in this standard of hotel 
we got a good price through travel republic 
temperature and water pressure are working good 
very nice outdoor patio veranda too 
location to discover malta and access the pier and bus terminals ( 5 minutes ) partial sea-view 
great location 
the staff are super nice and they are very accommodating 
loved the fusion and the execution thoroughly recommended the outdoor infinity pool was a highlight also and all that 
with a nice private terrasse 
the higher floor rooms have the best views 
it 's possible to walk around the streets easily and there are rows of shops selling handicrafts 
the food is first rate ( if expensive ) 
the lobby is beautiful 
it 's a good hotel with very standard marriott services 
typical spacious marriott hotel rooms with comfy bed 
parking was expensive 
had a view of the office building next to us and a partial view of canada 
the hotel is large and overall pretty nice 
the hotel is really large and the view from the room are exceptional 
rooms are very good and spacious 
we then returned to the club lounge to request a 1 . 
close to the airport and an hour from sapporo by car 
overpriced tacky shops and low quality western food restaurants 
with great japanese hospitality 
we did n't have meals at hotel because there are less expensive f&b shops near hotel like 
hotel was located close to the beach and the stroll was very pleasant 
probably best suited for business conferences as there are huge ballrooms to host business activities 
the only saving grace were the great cocktails i enjoyed throughout the different outlets 
the prices for transfer from to the airport are high 
the best best thing is the 3meter wide bed 
within a short 1 3 mile of beach you can choose from small 
as i was n't given a particular warm welcome and they have particularly uncomfortable and low chairs at the 
have stayed 4 since opening 
had an upgrade to a pretty big suite 
the breakfast is pretty awful but the staff are fine 
the bathroom was large and roomy and the bath tub was bliss 
the front desk got very messy when busy 
visually poor in both quality and content
